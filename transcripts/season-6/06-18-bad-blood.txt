A small Canadian farm town made national news when a woman claims she was raped by our own doctor DNA tests proved the doctor was innocent the victim insisted the DNA test was wrong what does a high school graduate no the world's top scientists do not.
Nestled along Canada's beautiful southwestern prairie is the tiny town of Kipling's Saskatchewan.
The population is so sparse the farm animals outnumber the residents.
In a town this size everyone knows one another.
Two fairly quiet farming community with little crime we may have up to five or six sexual assaults a year and break and enters but fairly small in the scope of criminal code.
This is the story of one of those alleged sexual assault cases took place on Halloween night in nineteen ninety two.
Depending on whose story you believe it was either a night of lies and trickery for an unfortunate misunderstanding.
A woman we'll call candy was working at this gas station her boyfriend stopped by.
They got into an argument.
And he drove to see her girl friend who worked at the Kipling memorial union hospital.
She wasn't there.
Candy upset under suggested she see a doctor.
Dr Jon Schneeberger was on call that night he was also candies Dr and even delivered her baby.
Candy says Dr Schneeberger recommended a sedative.
I wasn't really hysterical anymore but when I told them was that I was so mad at Danny that's.
But I didn't actually mean that I was catcalled Kellam I was just describing them how angry I was I had just expected that he would give me a couple pills or something just to relax my muscles calming down.
Instead Dr Schneeberger gave candy shocked.
She says she went numb almost immediately.
I had no control over my muscles for like all my muscles left and I was just this piece the jelly falling over.
I tried to scream as I was falling over nothing would come out except for like a croaking noise that a frog would make it was just it was so scary.
Candy isn't exactly sure what happened next but believes she was raped.
When a dentist freezes your gums.
You can't and he's pulling pulling your two without you can't feel.
At the the pain from the tooth but what you can feel this pressure of the tooth moving back and forth and.
And that's that's the only way I can describe it.
When she regained consciousness alone in the exam room candy had the presence of mind to place her underwear in an air tight back.
Candy was too dizzy to leave the hospital the nurses insisted she spend the night she said nothing of the alleged rape the next day.
She confronted Dr Sinead Burke I said.
How was that drug you gave me last night.
And he asked me why did it give you wild dreams.
And then I knew that oh my god I was gonna have a hell of a fight on my hands because here now he's already.
When candy was released from the hospital she spoke briefly with her parents and told them of her suspicions.
You could tell by the look on her face that.
That something terrible had happened to hurry I was really hoping I wasn't truly but.
She then drove to Regina a town two hours drive away and went to a rape clinic for testing.
There they found evidence of semen on her panties genes and on a vaginal swab that was part of my reasoning for going for the rape kit to find out if this really did happen is am I going not did my mind plays tricks on me or what the hell's going on here blood tests also revealed an unusual drug and candy system a drug called versus.
They use it as a pre anesthetic agents to induce anesthesia you start to go numb and not feel the power of your muscles are able to use your muscles and then you become very tired and sleepy.
When candy formally accuse Dr Schneeberger of rape many residents of Kipling believed candy was line.
Dr Schneeberger was a respected member of the community he had never been accused of anything like this before.
Some believe candidate as a single mother was either romantically interested in the married doctor or her motive was to get some sort of financial settlement to end the controversy the town looked up to the doctor he was a good doctor and.
He he would never do anything like that it was impossible.
Also suspicious was the fact the candy had said nothing the hospital nurses on the night of the alleged rape.
There were two nurses on shift that night in fact both of them were in that room the room that the the rape allegedly occurred in very shortly after.
they saw nothing amiss.
To end the controversy Dr Schneeberger willingly agreed to give blood for a DNA test.
The DNA in the blood drawn from doctor Schneeberger did not match the biological material from candies rape test kits.
And I was in shock again.
And I said no that's impossible that's impossible how how can this be.
Seven more years would go by before that question was finally answered.
When DNA tests showed the doctor Schneeberger was innocent of the sexual assault on his twenty year old patient most people in Kipling tried to put the whole thing behind.
Chandy the alleged victim would not let the issue die all during the next year she insisted that someone somehow had tampered with the first DNA test at the hospital.
So Dr Schneeberger agreed to a second DNA test in August of nineteen ninety three.
His blood was drawn by a registered nurse the test was monitored by the police and the vials were taken directly to the forensic laboratory at police headquarters.
They watched the needle actually penetrate the doctor's arm.
Once again Dr Snee burgers DNA did not match the DNA on candies clothing or the rape test kits.
Course I didn't believe them a lot of other people did believe them.
And I guess it's hard to know how you've got D. N. A. is the new thing and it's supposed to be so right and so perfect we knew there was something something wrong that.
Like we totally believed her a Elena we knew he was up to something.
Dr Schneeberger defended himself by saying the drug he injected in the candy that night in the hospital very sad can cause a rotted Colusa nations versa can account for all sorts of hallucinations possibly but it can't produce semen.
And according to the complainant the last time she had had intercourse was.
weeks before this this an incident.
With no other evidence in nineteen ninety four the police closed their investigation into this matter.
The doctor has already given to samples and those two samples were.
Tested and they came up as being having a DNA profile and the profile didn't match the semen that was left at the scene so now we're stuck we we really can do anything.
The town of Kipling.
Was not kind at all two candy.
She hired a private investigator who broke into doctor Schneeberger Scott.
On the headrest he found strands of hair.
But there were no roots attached so they couldn't be used for DNA testing.
Also in the car was a tube of lip balm presumably used by Dr shinny Barker.
At our own expense candy asked a private plan to test the epithelial cells on the end of the lip balm.
Those epithelial cells would contain enough DNA for testing.
And when they did.
Candy finally got her first piece of positive news.
I knew it all along it was a shock that something was going to match but it was a it was a bit of relief because at least we have that to prove to the police.
There were two problems first there was no proof that the cells were Dr Shinde burgers second the evidence couldn't be used in court since the investigator broke into the car without a warrant.
But if the cells on the lip balm with those of Dr Schneeberger why did the DNA from his lips differ from his blood samples.
To find out.
Candy filed a civil suit against doctor Schneeberger and brought charges against him with the local medical society.
At the hearing.
Candy sat directly across from Dr Shinde burgers wife.
If looks could kill I would have been dead Lisa was sitting across the table from me and she just sat there with her arms crossed just collaborating out me like Hugh little batch you are ruining our lives.
And I just sat in my chair thinking oh my god you're so stupid you know.
You are so stupid and if you don't watch and it's going to happen to your kids to.
All of this pressure prompted Dr Schneeberger to agree to yet another DNA test.
This time the procedure was videotaped by police and performed at their forensics lab.
The doctor appears friendly and helpful.
The technician wants to take blood from his finger.
But the doctor politely refuses saying he has a disease that would cause his hands to bruise.
That'S how we usually take the sample we don't need much blood.
Since this is a voluntary test the doctor can't be forced to do anything against his will.
So the technician inserts a needle into his left arm instead.
Nothing comes out.
The van was larger R. appeared much larger than I would have expected and I thought that was a little unusual.
She tries another two.
But still has trouble.
Sometimes the vacuum is poor in them and would not pull the boat out of the individuals are.
Eventually she was able to extract a sample.
Afterwards the nurse was puzzled.
And the lab determined that the samples was too degraded for DNA testing police broke the news to candy and I'm like oh my god whatever like that's both this is our last chance to get blood from him and you guys screwed up again.
Even the police were suspicious when DNA from Dr Shinde burgers lip balm match the DNA from candies rape test kits.
But since Dr Schneeberger had passed to prior blood DNA tests officials were hesitant to charge.
Because of his submitting voluntarily to a DNA sample it gave him the out it wasn't me there's a DNA sample showing it is not the only person who had an opportunity limited as it was was her doctor.
But we believed in the DNA.
Testing I mean we we believed in the science of DNA they had to follow the rules of the Canadian justice system I call it the Canadian criminal system.
Because that's basically what it is the criminals that have all the rights.
On April twenty fifth nineteen ninety seven five years after the alleged rape police got a break startling new information was discovered inside the doctor's own home.
Schneeberger stepdaughter his wife's biological child claimed that the doctor assaulted her to.
For several years the youngster says her step father had been coming into her room at night and giving her injections.
His wife discovered a box full of condoms needles and drugs including first set in the doctor's home office.
I blame myself I still blame myself.
I scream diet bald guy I was pretty disgusted because all of these years I mean I'm fighting to get the truth out but also to make sure that it didn't happen anybody else.
Dr Jon Schneeberger was arrested and ordered to undergo yet another DNA test.
Again the procedure was videotaped.
The doctor was withdrawn and silent.
Police took several samples hair saliva then blood.
Taken from his finger and not his arm.
And this time a surprise D. N. A. from all three samples matched DNA found on candies vaginal swab.
that was wonderful that was what I had wanted all along I mean I had even offered to go chop an arm off I would talk to one of the nodes to get that blood no problem it was a quite happy because we knew we had a.
But the big question remained unanswered how did Dr Schneeberger fooled the previous blood DNA tests.
It was a puzzle.
How those samples that come to be different than the last finger even if we knew there was something different there is no way that we could prove anything.
Especially since the nurses and police all witnessed the needle being inserted into Dr Snee burgers arm while the blood was drawn.
On the stand Dr Schneeberger wood reveals his secret.
In November of nineteen ninety nine Dr Jon Schneeberger went on trial in Saskatchewan for the rape of this patient candy and his own stepdaughter.
On the witness stand.
He said he surgically inserted a plastic tube under the skin and it was left on filled with blood from one of his patients.
This is why he insisted that the blood be drawn from his left arm rather than anywhere else.
If you look closely at the videotape of that blood test you'll see that the doctor is careful to pull his sleeve only so high so as not to reveal the incision where he inserted the teal.
And for a brief moment you can see the two protruding from his arm.
But by the time the third test was done five years after the rape accusation the blood in the tube was cold and dark which explains why the technician was suspicious.
Dr Schneeberger however denied raping candy he claims candy broke into his home stole a used condom use that biological sample the Framingham.
He said he used his patient's blood for the DNA test because he had no other way to defend himself.
When that came up at trial that he thought candy broke into his house and.
Stole samples there whatever it was laughable is absolutely laughable that he was had a grasp at straws like that it's just laughable I was a bulldog on the stand I kicked his lawyers asked in his post to be the best lawyer in southern Saskatchewan best defense lawyer while I showed him who was boss when you run across strong willed individuals sometimes the strong willed individuals are right and sometimes the wrong and this particular strong willed person was right and she was right all along and she was determined to see that so what happened to her didn't happen to anyone else this would be right up around the top as far as being the most bizarre the most involved and involving all forensic evidence here.
Of any case that I had.
Dr Schneeberger was found guilty of sexually assaulting candy as well as drugging her and obstructing justice.
He was also convicted of sexually assaulting his step daughter and was sentenced to six years in prison.
I'M so proud of candy if it was me I don't know if I could handle the whole everything that she went through his chest the test came back negative and she had to fight and it was just a constant battle.
While taping this interview candy received a telephone call in which she learned Dr Schneeberger had been denied parole I would.
He lost he lost both both of his chances to get out for day parole and full parole by god it's a great.
I was so worried that he was going to get out and everybody was going to fall for his lies and bulls again but they didn't they didn't they're smarter than the rest oh my god you guys know how exciting this is for me it's like celebration.
You have to remember that the DNA also let us off the path soul my when I lecture on this particular case to younger police officers I say don't remember the DNA does give you something but it has to be supported with cooperative evidence.
It was very frustrating not being able to have all the answers but.
It finally did come together after seven years and twenty four days.
