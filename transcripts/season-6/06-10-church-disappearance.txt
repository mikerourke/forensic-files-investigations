In nineteen eighty one six year old Kassie Hansen disappeared from an evening church service without a trace.
There were no witnesses the only clue was a strand of very rare and very unusual hair.
It was the most telling physical evidence police had.
On a cold November night in nineteen eighty one the Hanson family headed to a service at Jehovah Evangelical Lutheran church near Saint Paul Minnesota.
Ellen Hanson and her two daughters Cassie and Vanessa had been looking forward to family night at the church.
Build the children's father had another commitment and wasn't able to go with them it is searched in my memory.
And the girls get in the car Ellen was driving and they were in the garage and Cassie was sitting in the passenger seat of the car.
And she was blowing kisses at me through the window.
Ellen Cassie and Vanessa arrived at the church early the girls went downstairs to the children's area where Sunday school classes usually were held.
Kassie told her mother she had to go to the bathroom and said she'd be right back.
Few minutes later I followed her and she wasn't around anywhere.
So I went upstairs when outside the older name a couple times I get the phone call from Helen saying that Cassie was missing.
Breezing heavy you know and just thinking.
This is because you know your child and you know then that she would just not walk away from something like that.
Right away I knew something was definitely wrong.
When Cassie couldn't be found anywhere in the church the St Paul police were called to the scene.
Within an hour Cassie's photograph was distributed to local newspapers and television stations.
The search lasted throughout the night we stayed up all night long people came all night long to help.
there were a couple hundred people.
Police went door to door in the neighborhood and volunteers made hundreds of telephone calls all without success.
Early the next morning.
Police made the gruesome discovery.
Cassie Hansen's body was found in a dumpster behind an auto repair shop just three miles from the church.
This undercover officer was the first policeman on the scene it truly in service to community.
Incensed all of police officers.
It was as if you wish.
He seemed to be treating her as a piece of trash.
Cassis leather shoes minus the buckles were found in two separate locations not far from the dumpster.
The central line low covered the story for WCCO TV in Minneapolis.
The idea of a church is one place you can go and you let your daughter go to restroom this something you would do you feel a safe necessities you know basically good people are all in there together the last thing you ever expected me no reason to expect a stranger would come into a church an adopted child.
The autopsy revealed signs of sexual assault.
Semen found on her dress revealed the perpetrator at type O. blood.
And some foreign here's also were found.
The cause of death was strangulation with the two and a half inch built abrasions on Cassie's chest indicated another belt had been used as a restraint.
A member of the church recalled seeing a white man fifty to sixty years old with dark glasses and white here in the vicinity of the church bathrooms on the night of the induction.
It wasn't much but it was the only lead investigators have.
After Cassie Hansen's murder police attempted to locate all past sex offenders in the Minneapolis Saint Paul area is.
You hear the tone of a hundred and seven people who have been identified by the community or through police investigation of possible suspects of those one hundred and seventy.
Fifty seven of them are either lived or worked in the area for the little girl was abducted from police interrogated many of these individuals and soon they not only had a suspect but also a confession.
Lundell Conley a woman from Texas who had claimed to have killed Cassie Hansen and when she came to the attention of Saint Paul police and allegedly made a confession it turned out that what she did was read details in the paper.
And then recite them she said I claim that I acted alone well it was quite obvious that she couldn't generate seminal fluid and that the this was a sham a fraud.
Police found two other witnesses who saw a white male carrying a motionless child near the auto body shop dumpster on the night of the murder.
This was consistent with the description given by the church member who saw an elderly man near the church bathrooms.
With no other leads police contacted the F. B. I.'s behavioral science unit in Washington DC.
These profilers analyze the background and behavior of criminals who have committed similar crimes and make recommendations about the type of individual who should be considered a suspect.
Former agent John Douglas created the behavioral profile of Cassie Hansen's killer for the Saint Paul police.
Douglas said the killer would be a white male a loner with the poor self image who probably had a history of child sex offenses.
Douglas also predicted that the man would frequent parks where children playing.
You would be nocturnal and drive around at night.
After the murder he would leave the area.
Feel what he had done was justified you may have kept a souvenir from the crime.
Most important he would be obsessed with the merger and need to talk about.
One of the tips called in to police was from Dorothy Noga a massage parlor employee.
She told police one of her customers a taxi cab driver Stuart Knowlton had been in her massage parlor the day after Cassie Hansen's murder.
K. E. S. tell them I was in here last night to.
Which made her suspicious.
During police questioning Milton denied he was involved in any way.
The little girl this I'm trying to tell you this I feel sorry for that logo for her family.
Note also claimed to have an alibi.
He said he was on duty driving his taxi cab on the night of the murder.
If his alibi checked out.
Police had hit a dead end.
Three months passed since Cassie Hansen's murder and police finally had a suspect in fifty seven year old taxi cab driver Stewart mills.
Knowlton had an.
He said he was working on the night of the murder.
In the back alley underground of massage parlors it's not unusual for clients to confess their most perverse sexual fantasies and sometimes their secrets.
Miss Dorothy Noga had many clients who confided in her Milton was one of the.
He asked Dorothy to say he was at the massage parlor on the night of Cassie Hansen's murder.
No go went to the police and offered to tape record her conversations with Milton but police declined our offer is too dangerous.
Janice read also was familiar with Stuart Knowlton.
Miss Redman was head of St Paul's public housing office.
Eight months before Cassie Hansen's merger a resident filed a formal complaint against Stuart Knowlton alleging he made sexual advances towards some of the children.
I can't remember anyone.
Read made the same offer to police the Dorothy Noga had to conceal a wire on her body and talk to Stuart Knowlton about the merger of little Cassie Hanson.
This time police accepted.
When Janice Redman met with Milton she asked if you have been following news reports about Cassie's murder.
Knowlton admitted he had then he made a critical mistake.
He said that Cassie had been beaten about the face.
This fact had not been released to the.
That was crucial and that was a very critical because no one had revealed to the press for the media to anyone.
Only the killer could have known that.
Meanwhile we didn't have any witnesses and it wasn't entirely a circumstantial case.
As police prepared to close in Stuart Milton was crossing the street in downtown Saint Paul he was hit by a car.
Asli injured was rushed to the hospital.
I was amputated below the knee.
To which the children were going to be protected and that he would not be able to.
When police check Knowlton's alibi they discovered that on the night of the murder he had not turned in his log book.
Despite police warnings the masseuse Dorothy Noga called Stuart Knowlton on her own she to ask Knowlton if you've been following the news reports Cassie Hanson smarter.
She was a hero for us she told us that during one of these conversations that he admitted to.
That he had killed a little girl.
What do you know the greed and wanted to help in the case and stated that she would be willing to talk to him to tape these conversations.
And she did this hours all but he wouldn't repeat the confession on tape.
Later when Dorothy Noga left her massage parlor a man jumped out of the darkness and slashed her throat.
He ran away leaving her for dead.
In an attempt to recall the events surrounding her assault.
Dorothy Noga underwent hypnosis.
Through hypnosis Dorothy Noga remembered the man who stabbed her that night and left her for dead.
She alleged it was Stuart Knowlton who attacked her just hours after the telephone conversation in which he confessed to the murder of Cassie Hansen.
Minnesota state law prohibits testimony from individuals with hypnotic plea enhanced recollection so no charges were filed for this incident.
Scientists investigating Cassie Hansen's merger had a semen sample which showed the perpetrator's blood was type of.
In nineteen eighty three D. N. A. testing was still years away from widespread use in criminal cases.
So did thirty seven percent of the population.
So police obtained a hair sample from Stuart Knowlton and sent it along with Cassie Hansen's clothing to the FBI forensic laboratory in Washington DC.
The technicians used a spatula to scrape loose here's and fibers from Cassie's clothing.
Under a stereomicroscope those hairs and fibers were analyzed and compared to here is taken from Stuart Knowlton.
The comparison is subjective even the specimens looks similar comparing hair samples is not like matching fingerprints.
Al robo lard was in charge of the FBI's here and fiber unit at the time.
It'S not a means of absolute personal identification.
Because I say that the hair.
Matches in individual or has the same microscopic characteristics as that individuals hairs does not absolutely mean it came from him.
The reason the reason for that is hairs are not so unique that they allow you to reach an absolute conclusion.
It'S possible that two hairs that are so nearly alike can't be distinguished microscopically could come from two separate individual.
But in this case Wrobel aren't made an interesting discovery.
Found a hair on Cassie Hansen's clothing that was so unique he had never seen it before nor has he seen it since.
In in my career looking at here's the FBI laboratory.
I'Ve never seen.
Commonly that's referred to as in the ring to hair or banded here.
So I thought this was rather significant.
If you think.
In these bands are creating because there's a break down in that area.
That begins to separate.
When Wrobel large analyze Knowlton's here he discovered that it showed signs of the same condition.
No doubt about it thousands of here's over the course of my career and I only saw this will always able to put two here's associate a victim to a suspect not only through the microscopic characteristics but also through a disease of the hair.
With this discovery.
Stuart Knowlton was arrested and charged with Cassie Hansen's murder.
Dorothy nobis testimony held the courtroom spectators spellbound.
She told the jury what Knowlton said during a telephone call just hours before she was attacked.
Milton said he was driving his taxi cab in the vicinity of the Jehovah Evangelical Lutheran Church when he needed to use the bathroom.
Knowlton ran into Kassie Hansen.
You hear for the church services.
Mom and dad.
He asked her if she wanted to play a game.
When he took her outside to his taxi she became frightened and started to scream.
In the taxi when Cassie was struggling to get away no.
Later he put her body in a dumpster a few miles away.
The buckle off her shoes possibly as a trophy and drop the shoes in two different locations.
When he talked about shoes at first it meant nothing to me.
In retrospect it was it was probably more significant than I thought the description of Stuart Knowlton's rare hair condition convinced the jury that the banded hair found on Cassie Hansen's clothing came from Stuart Knowlton.
The evidence from the FBI laboratory was the absolutely critical one piece of evidence that was absolutely essential to tying him in and to being able to get a conviction of Stourton old.
Stuart Knowlton was found guilty of first degree murder and second degree misconduct and sentenced to life in prison.
To this day.
The Hanson family visits Cassie's grave and hope that Cassie's death might serve as a warning to others.
Hanson'S founded an organization called save Cassie's friends which uses print and video materials to heighten awareness to child abduction can happen anytime anywhere.
