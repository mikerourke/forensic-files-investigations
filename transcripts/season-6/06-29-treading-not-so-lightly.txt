In nineteen eighty four year old Vicky Lyons was found in the parking lot.
Unconscious and near death.
There were no witnesses no one knew what really happened.
But taking his mother was determined to find out.
West Texas is far removed from big cities like Dallas and Houston.
The land is flat and dry.
Dotted with the occasional oil well or cotton field.
At the crossroads of interstate twenty and route eighty seven is a little town called Big Spring.
How to hear when the local high school marching band is invited to the state tournament.
It'S front page news.
That front page belongs to the Big Spring Herald newspaper which chronicles all the town's activities no matter how big or small.
I worked in circulation department.
It was very nice I knew all the people there I've known him for a long time.
In nineteen eighty crystal Lyons was living in Big Spring with her husband bill and four year old daughter Vicki.
Very quiet day we should not get your hands dirty or feet thirty six if you take your shoes off she would walk ins take one step dust off your set just over hands and take another step shoes very.
Like all working mothers crystal was often pulled in two directions.
One day when the babysitter didn't show up Crystal supervisor gave her a tough choice.
I told my boss that I didn't have anyone to take care of the kids that day and she he told me that if I don't bother to come in I didn't have a job.
Since crystal had taken Vicky into work before she decided to do it again I think he are you today.
co workers like the little girls and crystal kept her eye on Vicki as best she could.
While crystal was moving papers to the loading dock for afternoon delivery reference J. B. Hartman drove.
As the delivery vehicles were preparing to leave the loading dock crystal heard her supervisor tell Becky to go outside and play in the parking lot.
Hours are six AM telling you know I don't feel comfortable about any of this on just to go home and you can make your decision.
But before she could say anything the supervisors solving lying on the ground not moving.
You could tell from even the distance that you know should then hit.
When crystal got there Vicky was unconscious and not breathing.
No one else was there and there was no indication what happened.
He was rushed by ambulance to the hospital about an hour away.
As its crystalline Vicky hadn't already been through enough the ambulance broke down along the way.
We almost hit it we were right behind the ambulance we almost fifteen minutes cause it to slow down and to such a point that we had to get out of the waves of actually the ambulance got to the hospital and Vicky was rushed to intensive care.
That'S when it really hit me that her condition was.
That she may not make it.
The family to see Vicky.
she was in a coma.
And then she started.
What they thought throwing up blood.
And so they ask a slave we hadn't been in there maybe two minutes.
As they left the room they noticed unusual marks on Vicky's face.
As a tire marks on her face and.
I still had the presence of mind to get her camera and take pictures of these marks on Vicky's face before they disappeared.
Had she not taken this important step.
The story that follows might never have happened.
One of the key lay in a coma with their mother by her side police questioned everyone at the newspaper but no one had seen the incident.
Police caught up with him in the nearby town of Snyder.
What is it that after almost three weeks in a call Vicky regained consciousness she suffered severe damage to risk all and one on.
Could not walk or even speak.
One day crystal took the key to the newspaper office to see everyone who had been concerned about.
When one of the employees leaned into the car to say hello Vicky reacted violently a couple times.
It was the first time Vicky had spoken since the accident.
In seeking to started kicking and screaming you know what little voice could come out you know that was the first sign of the voice actually was justice.
it wasn't even clear voice it was just more of a screech type thing.
But Vicky was not well enough to explain her reaction.
Krystal decided to conduct her own investigation.
Kristol believes the answer to the mystery of what happened to Vicky.
And when those marks on the key space marks which hospital employees identified as higher marks.
I just started thinking you know what with the police to crystal made a list of all vehicle she could remember seeing in the newspaper parking lot prior to Vicky's accident.
Then she needed to find a way to compare the marks on Vicky's face to the tires of those vehicles.
Crystal rock black shoe Polish on each tire.
And then pressed plain white paper against it.
She kept careful records of which tire impression came from each vehicle.
In all she took nine tire impressions from two vans and a pickup truck.
Then she showed her detective work to the police are searching arrested the wrong person also due for a rest a black man who was just a sweet harmless old man who never did anything wrong to anybody and I said you need to you know fix this.
The spot of blood on the truck turned out to be fish blood.
Crystal did not believe Reverend Hartman was the one who ran over Vicky.
But police refused to investigate further saying it was a civil matter not a criminal one.
It was possible that the driver may have driven over Vicky and mistaken the bomb for a pot.
By the time they got out there all they had was an empty parking lot they didn't really have any eye witnesses in fact there were no eyewitnesses.
For the next three years she nursed Vicky back to health no one in the small town of Big Spring was willing to help.
One day while reading a magazine crystal saw an article about a man known as the Sherlock Holmes of tire marks.
This was the break that crystal had been praying for.
Peter McDonald literally wrote the book on tiring pression evidence.
He was formally the chief designer for the Firestone tire company he also assisted numerous police agencies and taught at the FBI academy.
After reading the magazine article about McDonald crystal Lyons called him in Ohio.
She explained the case as best she could and told him about the pictures she had taken which appeared to show a higher mark.
Luckily for the lions family Donald was no stranger to tire impressions in human flesh I heard one of her.
With the evidence crystal had gathered.
Donald thought he could help.
I think it's amazing.
That she had the foresight.
To make rubbings of suspect tires I don't always get that sort of work from police on major homicide case.
Crystal had labeled each of the tyrant freshens with the date and its position on the vehicle.
Two of the vehicles a couple of the night very quickly one was a big snow tire type design another was a passenger design but at the hand major groups that were kind of lightning shaped.
Which was different than the imprint on the case for.
The last three imprints work interesting they were golden sonic seventy eights a relatively rare tire no longer manufactured.
The same tread pattern appears in US normally about twelve different sizes so it's important to me to confirm that it's not only the same manufacturer the same brand.
But that it has exactly the same size.
Crystals photographs did not contain a size reference.
How could make Donald determined the size of the tire impression on Vicky's face taken three years earlier.
Another photograph was taken this time with the scale reference.
The human skull rose most rapidly in the first three years of life.
Between the ages of four and seven the distance between the eye sockets and mouths usually remain the same.
This knowledge help McDonnell to compare these two photographs with the scale of rap.
Put in the tire to improve traction and they are a forensic scientist range to rule because I can help determine the lawyer of the tire.
Sites are made by small metal blades placed in the tire mold to make the tire stronger the blade sometimes have a small indentation creating a raised area of rubber called tie bar.
The title found interruptions in the sites caused by the exposed tie bar.
He determined the tire had worn down about five one hundredths of an inch.
Two of the sonic seventy eight imprints could now be eliminated since they had very little wait.
The last the imprint showed the same degree of wear and matched in size.
McDonnell believes that the right front tire of the newspaper truck driven by an employee will call Bob Jones had run over a decade.
Jones was the man who said hello to Vicki asked for the access when Vicky had reacted violently.
In nineteen eighty five Crystal lions filed suit against the Big Spring Herald claiming that Jones hadn't taken the proper precautions while backing his truck out of the parking the unfortunate accident would mean a lifetime of neurological difficulties for Vicky and crystal wanted justice.
The lions needed dozens of surgical procedures because the accident damaged her hearing vision and sense of balance but she was able to attend school.
Asked me is mentally retarded.
The doctors it suggested which is parallel churn just forget or I can do that she's my child a lot of her.
Crystal Lyons says she didn't so the Big Spring Herald just for financial motives she wanted them to take responsibility for the accident that left her daughter permanently disabled.
I wanted everybody to know the trees.
And it came down to the point where in order for Vicky to get to the appropriate medical attention and to stay where she was sad and getting good medical attention and and have a life that money was going to be involved.
Vicki Lyons tries not to think about the accident but she remembers it.
I remember mine.
Some toys dishes was.
On the day of the accident the driver of the vehicle in a rush backed out over Vicky in the unpaid bumpy parking lot.
Apparently without realizing it.
Even before the lawsuit Jones suspected he might have been the one who ran over Vicky.
The driver make comments to crystal.
But that he did not think he did it but if you did it that he was sorry that it happened.
All I can say is.
It'S done it's over with.
I don't know why they did that but I'm willing to forgive.
The Herald wanted to settle the case the newspaper offered to pay seven hundred fifty thousand dollars towards the care Vicky would need for the rest of her life.
Fifteen minutes in the judge's chambers for her and to meet with the representative of the Herald a lot.
I asked her if she had anything to say to them and.
She told you destroyed my.
That was pretty much well beyond the lawsuit right then and there the Big Spring Herald did not report the news of the settlement the paper now has new owners and a completely different staff.
Crystal had the insight to take the photographs she had the insight to get tired she had the insight to tear out this piece of paper in the magazine that had Peter McDonald.
Without her having done all of that obviously I don't think anything any of this would have gotten done.
Peter McDonald is more than a forensic specialist he's also an artist and his paintings and sketches and cover the walls of.
Some of his works are inspired by the many cases he has helped the song.
One is based on the photo of the young girl he never met.
Twenty years years wondered what happened to her.
In a case like this you don't get emotionally involved.
Crystal was able to arrange for the best medical care for Vicky and Vicky has learned to speak and walk again.
Although he tries to put the accident in the past.
She lives with its legacy every day.
I always get.
Because I don't I will make.
Vicki is thinking about getting out more.
Finished high school and is considering coming.
Her mother now divorced is already attending college in Denver studying forensic science.
