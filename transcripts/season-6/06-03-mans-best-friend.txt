In nineteen eighty nine.
Four year old girl was rushed to a Texas hospital.
An artery in her leg was completely separate.
The little girl died shortly after arrival.
Medical investigators believe the leg wound was no accident.
Emory Texas is a small farming community about ninety miles east of Dallas.
With a population of less than a thousand life is simple here.
Peaceful and quiet.
In nineteen eighty eight Debbie loveless and her two daughters from a previous marriage Amy and Dave all moved in with John Miller.
He too was divorced and worked in the construction industry.
My marriage was John was good use.
A very good man.
Took care of me and the kids are well.
And we had a happy home life we had a lot of fun together the children we did a lot of things with the children we didn't believe in home we went somewhere as we took on with this and have a family.
It'S very close knit family really.
John and Debbie and the two girls moved on to a five acre farm just a few miles outside of town.
It was complete with the house barn horses and family pets and for the children freedom to roam and play among the beauties of nature.
Four year old April love living on a farm.
She loved to play outside to love you know being outside in in.
Cited time keeping her out of trees she was just bubbly I mean she was just full of life she just got into everything he's always run and I don't think she knew how to walk she is ran everywhere just a bundle of fun.
Just after Christmas on January fourth nineteen eighty nine the couple's older daughter Amy headed for school.
April went outside to play.
Debbie deter chores John was working on an old building on the corner of the property.
Around noon Debbie call for April to come home for lunch but there was no response.
Then John came running towards the house carrying April who was bleeding profusely from the severe leg wound.
I can do anything.
I was hysterical I mean I was just.
Because she was just black and blue all over and I could see it at a distance you know it it was just.
It was horrible.
I knew that this was a serious very serious when when she had already bled out she has a very small amount of time in which to get help and survive.
Even though John was a trained paramedic there was little he could do April had lost too much blood.
The four by six inch gash in April's leg had torn away a large portion of her femoral artery.
It is just that is like that whole section of her legs just gone.
It was just.
Doctors did everything they could to save April's life but the damage was just too great.
And it was just.
She went through too much and she went into a second shock.
She just couldn't make.
Four year old a full died on the operating room table.
John told police that he found his stepdaughter new under a tree bleeding profusely from the lake.
According to John April said.
The dogs did it.
The sheriff ordered an autopsy the suspicion.
John Miller said his daughter April before her death told him that the dog Koster fatal leg wound the local sheriff's department suspected foul play.
Journalist David Henner is covered this story for The Dallas Morning News.
They had a dead child on their hands so they needed to investigate it and I think there.
Their immediate thinking was someone killed her.
During the autopsy the pathologist noticed long vertical markets and puncture wounds all over people's body which he believed were indicative of some form of abuse.
And he saw no indication that April's leg wound was caused by a dog since the wound did not have the jagged edges often seeing an animal bite.
The wound cleanly caught in the path of the just concluded it had been made by a knife.
This finding was that April had been murdered.
As John and Debbie return from April's funeral service they faced a full scale investigation the police were everywhere.
I don't I don't know exactly how many but there was people everywhere walking everywhere and go into the house and and walking everywhere outside so you know what's going on in what are you doing and they told me then that it was a investigation you know into the death of a pro.
They felt like it dogs can have done to her it was very scary.
I just I couldn't figure it out I can understand.
How somebody could comment on that police found April's blood on a fence post and some leaves found no other outward signs of any dog attack.
There were three dogs on the property to belong to the family the third belonged to a neighbor none of the dogs had shown any hint of violence before.
In the couple's home investigators found paraphernalia allegedly linking the couple to the occult.
They thought maybe the cutting of April's leg was a blood letting ceremony for a cult and that's why she died that's why this was done.
And that was one theory that they investigated heavily.
Police also collected an electric curling iron thumb tacks and push.
Items suspected of causing the scratch marks and puncture wounds on April's body.
We were grilled for hours.
About nice that was supposedly had made the cut on her leg did I have the knife where was it John's hunting knife was confiscated and all of the items were sent to the crime lab for analysis a presumptive test showed possible signs of blood on the knife and with that finding John Miller and Debbie loveless were charged with murder.
Are just horrendous of them holding this little girl down gash in her leg with this this knife and cutting out a large chunk of skin and artery with this knife and then whacking her repeatedly what this curling iron and then sticking little push pins and.
John and Debbie were both given lie detector tests Debbie passed but John did not.
The state police and local police held the polygraph I guess the same well you flunked it so you must have done it.
He had failed and I couldn't understand I never seen any kind of violence any kind of anything out of John in these police officers were telling me that he did this I can understand it.
It made no sense to me.
Yes so then I did question you know.
And try to figure out.
The trial John and Debbie were represented by court appointed attorneys.
One of the lawyers did not want to use the dog attack story as a defense.
The other lawyer came in and said look we can't pursue the dog attack he said the DA threatened us that we he can just blow us out of the water there's nothing there to show dog attacks so.
Basically I have nothing to fight with.
Prosecutors portrayed John as the enraged stepfather who got angry with April lost his temper and abused and murdered her.
Tammy was portrayed as a battered wife too afraid of her husband to do anything about it.
Submitted into evidence was the autopsy report April had been murdered and the items from the couple's home which were suspected of causing the wounds.
If you're sitting there listening to them lay out this theory of how they think this this crime occurred.
I mean it's it's a it's a horrendous case it's it's horrible to think of them you know holding this little girl down and doing stuff to John's court appointed attorney called check would ask the judge for more time to interview prosecution witnesses and he also requested funds to hire his own forensic expert both requests were denied.
But defense chemist testified that the original test on John's hunting knife which found blood was presented.
Further testing on the knife showed it wasn't human blood.
And no blood was found on the curling iron to push pins or some tax.
The possibility of a dog attack was never presented to the jury.
In final arguments one of the defense lawyers.
it minutes it was murder admits the April was was murdered by someone says you know she was murdered I don't know who did it but the state has improved my client is the one who did it.
The jury found both John and Debbie guilty of murder and sentenced them to life in prison.
The first time that a steel door crying behind me there is no sound that you've ever heard the town's.
It has a distinct sound that will just make your hair stand on end.
You know that's not going to open again.
I couldn't close my eyes and see anything except for.
The way she was with the founder and the way she looked and she tied.
I didn't sleep for a long time.
I thought I was going to be there for the rest of my life.
I had started fighting the day I got in I had already written the centurion ministries had written to the governor had written to lieutenant governor I'd written a congressman.
I probably could have had a pretty good meal on.
When when when you're put in that position and you're convicted of something that you didn't do you just.
I just lost all hope of anything.
Good ever come from it you know if ever for ever to be turned around.
I knew I was innocent I knew David was innocent and I was not gonna stop fighting until I got somebody to prove we were innocent.
As the years passed in prison Debbie love listen John Miller's first concern was for their older daughter Amy who is living in foster care the other concern was finding a way to prove their innocence you know I never knew innocent people went to prison.
I was convicted for something they didn't do.
I just I guess I was naive and stupid thinking that it didn't happen.
And then when it did I was just I couldn't believe it.
Because I was innocent and they were saying I was guilty.
John and Debbie maintains that April was playing outside and was on closed because it was a warm day.
They believe that one of the dogs attacked April while she was playing.
Lunch time when they were looking for April they saw the dogs were agitated when John followed them into the woods he found a poll bleeding profusely from a leg wound.
John said April told him that the dogs did it before she lapsed into unconsciousness.
But the pathologist who performed the autopsy ruled the death a homicide.
Attorney Robert Ardis was assigned to handle the couple's appeal.
Robert are this is one of those attorneys that renews your faith in the legal profession he has a good heart he won't stop digging until he.
Guess where he thinks he ought to be.
While in the courthouse sifting through the evidence artist found a box containing hundreds of photographs of April's wounds.
Most were autopsy photos which have been shown to the jury at the trial.
But he also found another set of photos taken just after April entered the emergency room.
These were photos that had not been shown to the jury and it wasn't clear whether John and Debbie's original defense lawyers had even seen them.
When artists compared the two sets of pictures he made a startling discovery.
The pictures of April's leg wound were different.
Artist sent the photos to a forensic pathologist at the southwestern institute of forensic science in Dallas.
After studying the photos he said this child had been attacked by a dog.
He said adding data yeah I have something with canine teeth what we were able to show how a dog's teeth reduced overlay exactly on the puncture wounds around where the place had been taken out of the way.
Dr Dennis a sin is a forensic odontology just ten degrees at animal bites are often difficult to identify.
He says that many animal bites don't look like bite wounds at all because animals often tear the flesh rather than biting it.
When you have a an injury pattern to determine whether it's a bite mark them up or not you need to look at the unit in the entire situation to see what other clues and evidence there might be is this truly a bite mark or not.
Why didn't the original pathologist see this.
The answer was obvious the wound look different at the autopsy because it had been cleaned and trimmed with the scalpel while the surgeon attempted to repair the wound and save April's life.
When you go into surgery the wound in this particular instance was very jagged very.
And even and the surgeons used a scalpel we'll go in and clean the wound and they will go back and get back into fresh tissue there.
And the new team of pathologists noted that many of the scratch marks on April's back consisted of four parallel lines.
Lines corresponding with the four nails of a dog's four feet.
There was another program I'm told that as long as a person is alive those particular bruises that had the print of a Paul there would not show up.
But when she was on her back in the operating room and died on the operating table.
There was now.
After spending five years in prison for the murder of their daughter April's John Miller and Debbie loveless finally had forensic evidence to corroborate their story.
One of the dogs on their property tax and killed a.
Their new attorney Robert artists also uncovered a written deposition from the woman who had witnessed the dogs on John and Debbie's farm attack three different people on three separate occasions as you pointed this out to the sure.
The woman wasn't called to testify at the original trial.
Armed with this new evidence artist requested a new trial his argument that John Miller and Debbie loveless did not have adequate counsel at their original trial.
Ironically John Miller's original defense attorney Paul chip would agree.
Well he was he was pissed off.
it's it nobody likes to be told that they did a bad job officially and ineffectiveness of counsel basically says that.
Although Paul Chitwood is now deceased he testified on behalf of John and Debbie at a pre trial hearing reminding the court he requested and was denied access to the prosecution witnesses before the trial and was denied funds to hire an independent forensic expert to analyze the evidence.
It always felt that they were not guilty of the crime they were charged with.
The prosecutor's office would not comment on the allegation that some of the photographs in this case might have been withheld from the original defense team.
In nineteen ninety three.
A judge dismissed the case against John Miller and Debbie loveless citing overwhelming evidence in the couple's favor.
After five long years.
Finally released from prison.
It was a very poor investigation by law enforcement they didn't buy the dog attack theory they didn't look into it.
I can believe it I just it was just it was scary because I had been this place for almost five years.
I just can't even explain it is not I don't think there's words to.
Happiness that I was going home it was going to see Amy.
The stresses and strains and incarceration took its toll after they were released from prison Debbie and John separated.
I lost five years with my son with Amy and would that be you know they were gone.
Debbie was gone she found somebody else you know because of trying to get help and she was gone so as far as yes I was walking out of prison but my life has basically been destroyed already.
That investigation aided by bad science really he was was kind of frightening to me this could have happened to.
To you know any of that's just the injustice of everything that was done.
You know how they they crucified us for something that we didn't do.
Hello and I don't understand why they did it.
