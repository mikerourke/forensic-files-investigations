IBM already motors on the expressway in Brownsville and prove it to yourself we really do have great service and low prices when the Texas car dealer was found shot to death in his van it looked at first like suicide but a closer examination of the evidence convinced investigators the man had been murdered in cold blood.
A decade would pass in the family would be ripped apart before a jury rendered final judgment on what really happened that hot Texas nine.
In the early morning of September sixteenth nineteen eighty seven a couple in Brownsville Texas watch late night TV before going to bed.
Forty three year old bill Mowbray complained of having trouble with his back and told his wife Susie he was going to sleep.
About a half hour later she switched off the TV and turned in for the night.
Soon afterward the Mowbray's lives would change forever.
So she said she heard a noise and woke up to see your husband's elbow pointing upward into the air seconds later she heard a loud explosion she leapt out of bed and found him bleeding profusely a pistol lay near his hand she said she pulled it away and dropped it it landed in a pool of his blood.
She rushed downstairs to call for help.
First call was to one of her husband's co workers he did it she told him he shot himself.
My husband after threatening suicide.
For at least three years almost on a weekly basis finally did it and the worst thing that could ever happen to anyone.
After telling the co worker what happened Susie Mowbray then called nine one one.
Homicide investigator George could veto was one of the first people on the C..
She was waiting at the gate she had a mixed drink in one hand she had a cigarette and she went in when the deputies came and went back to the house she pointed to the room upstairs where it was paramedics and investigators found bill Mowbray with blankets pulled up to his neck he looked as if you were sleeping.
Except for the massive damage caused by the three fifty seven magnum that's laying near his body.
The entrance wound was on the right side the right temple in the exit wound was on the left temple.
Now all of this was a very high energy weapon it was a very very disruptive blast it literally blew this.
The gun barrel had been placed directly against Bill Mowbray's head as the bullet exited his left ten.
It went through his left hand which was apparently resting under his hand when the shot was fired this was either a homicide or suicide either he shot himself with his right hand of.
And what had his left hand bracing is had no there was a plausible theory at that point or somebody else shot him while he was lying or perhaps sleeping on his left hand.
Brownsville residents were shocked to learn that one of their most high profile residents had apparently killed himself.
Bill Mowbray ran a local Cadillac dealership and was well known in town.
But the dealership had fallen on hard times bill was deeply in debt and was being investigated for alleged tax fraud he was fairly desperate he had gone to a banker and put his head down on the desk and cried in front that biker said if you don't love me two hundred thousand dollars to help me out I'm going to kill myself and he was desperate he had gone to every source a new for funds it looked as if bill Mowbray had gone through with his threat.
But investigators weren't so sure.
They noticed something unusual in the position of his body something that said it was physically impossible for him to have shot himself.
They were convinced that bill Mowbray staff was not suicide.
Thirty nine Susie Mowbray was attractive personable and an asset to her husband bill's business.
Where you can buy all American.
The two most coming off divorces had met nine years earlier and married soon afterward.
They lived a good life a beautiful home exotic vacations condos at the beach or bill Mowbray money was no object my brother did have a tendency to spend a lot of money he did like good things he won he would get involved in any kind of a.
Like a hobby he would get involved completely but bill was having serious money problems he was over extended on his business and in trouble with the IRS.
He was also cheating on his wife.
When you were separating them bill was going out with someone else and and but Susie had found out about it too she found a couple of glasses of champagne in the bad.
When when she had come back and and question the made about it in the maid had confirmed that you know bill was going out with someone.
On the day before his death.
Susie discovered that bill had made changes to their insurance policies she found that within days the current policies would be canceled and bill's daughter would become the main beneficiary of new policies worth almost two million dollars.
Four police this signaled the possible motive for murder we got the two year a suicide policies in Texas if you buy an insurance policy you have to wait two years before you commit suicide just by to commit suicide of course doesn't pay off and if the new insurance by what to begin with you she wasn't going to receive any money so she had to make a move which had to make a quick Susie's actions just after bill's death also arouse suspicions.
Bill'S brother Jim went to the house just hours after bill's body had been removed.
I'Ve been told that he had killed himself in his bedroom which was up a set of stairs.
And as I got closer and closer I started hearing music and people laughing and stuff up in the bedroom and I was taken by that and about that moment Susie popped out front of me.
In my first words to her were what's going on and she said we're having a painting party.
And I was dumbfounded like having a party at this point is rather when appropriate considering everything had been taken out of the room all the furniture even the carpet was gone.
But for police the unusual position of bill Mowbray's body provided clear indications of foul play.
When a high powered gun is fired at close range into someone's head it creates what is called blow back basically the force of the blast blows brain and blood matter back on to the hand and arm of the shooter.
Bill Murray would have had to shoot himself with his right hand since his left hand clearly contains an exit wound.
It is a right hand was lying on his side and was virtually free of blood.
There was a very minimal amount of blood smeared about the right arm and hand but no spatter.
To me this indicated that it was extremely unlikely that he could have been holding the gun when the shot was fired.
at that point and I reached the conclusion that this individual could not have shot himself.
In addition his right hand was under the covers.
It seemed impossible that he could have fired a bullet into his head and then pull the covers back over himself all the way up to his neck.
What'S more blood analysts sergeant dusty has Q. said he found blood spatter and traces of lead on the night down Susie Mowbray was wearing when bill died.
All indications were that bill Mowbray had not killed himself.
There was only one other person in the house the night of his death his wife Susie.
And she had a one point eight million dollar motive to kill.
Prosecutor bill Hagen theorizes that Susie could've laid next to bill and using the pillows and blankets as a barrier between them fired at point blank range into his head.
He says that despite the barrier blowback left blood spatter and lead vapors on her gown.
These red dots show where has do you claim to have found blocked.
Four months after bill's death.
Susie Mowbray went on trial.
I don't think anyone in their right mind would say I feel confident going into a trial like this now I'm scared.
After a three week trial Susie Mowbray was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.
The jury agreeing that it was physically impossible for bill Mowbray to have shot himself but as she was sent away.
Her supporters said they found evidence that she was innocent the question was whether they would ever get a chance to prove.
In June of nineteen eighty eight Susie Mowbray was sent to prison to serve a life sentence for the murder of her husband bill.
She maintains her innocence while attempting to adjust to life behind bars.
I can remember there was this moment of utter Jess terror after they had announced the verdict and this female.
Officer of some sort is escorting me over to the county jail.
The first words out of my mouth are they going to hurt me.
And she said.
Her supporters particularly weighed Burnett for twenty year old son from a previous marriage went back to the evidence that was used to convict her claiming crucial details were misrepresented he found that prosecutors had not disclosed the report that contradicted their own case it had been done by Herbert macdonell a highly regarded blood spatter expert he had examined the gowns Susie Mowbray was wearing when she allegedly shot her husband the evidence examine strongly suggested that that government was anywhere near bill Mowbray when he was shot and of course that would assist the defense and not the prosecution McDonnell was never called to testify.
Instead the prosecution's author of blood analyst sergeant dusty has skewed testified that he found forty eight separate blood spatters on Susie Mowbray scholar this was a particularly damning piece of evidence he said he used luminol to examine the gown.
Luminol is a chemical that causes blood to glow or luminescence even after it has been cleaned.
The effect only lasts for about thirty seconds time has Skuse said the measure all the blood spatters this is a claim dismissed by most blood spatter experts.
I don't know what to do Shaw specs of glowing material in the dark but according to his testimony he saw many and he measured up this is like measuring the the link to the firefly night in the spring time that's a good trick I wish I knew how to do that I don't.
There were other problems blood is not the only substance that will glow when in contact with luminol certain breaches even something like horseradish will also glad no one doubts that has skews saw something glowing on Susie Mowbray's night down but no tests were ever performed to determine if what he saw was in fact a lot.
The forensic evidence in the original trial pointed a particular way and it turned out that all they're testing in a friend's ex we're all flawed and.
Probably carelessly done everything was so directed towards a finding of guilt about I really feel like it wasn't a fair analysis of the forensic evidence.
When it was discovered that the night down had not been properly tested the judge overturned the verdict and after serving nine years Susie Mowbray was released from jail I am standing here with my family not inside a prison this is freedom.
But she would have to face a new trial.
Prosecutors remain confident that the evidence used to convict her the first time would convict her once again.
She put a gun to bill's hand she pulled the trigger and she did it because marriage was going bad and she I saw an opportunity to continue living a lifestyle she had collected some money.
But her defense attorney said it was clear bill Mowbray killed himself and that key evidence proving their case was gone.
The T. shirt bill was wearing when he was shot and been torn apart by paramedics trying to save and the blanket next to his body which would have absorbed large amounts of blood spatter had been lost shortly after his death.
Susie Mowbray's re trial in January of nineteen ninety eight was perhaps the biggest media event in the area's history.
People lined up for hours to get a seat in court thousands more watched nationwide on court TV finally it appeared the courts would answer a question now almost a decade.
Brady killed himself.
Or was he the victim of a cold blooded killer.
Second motor the main bone of contention in the retrial of Susie Mowbray centered on a simple issue.
Bill Mowbray had been shot with a high powered gun at point blank range whoever shot him would've been spattered with blood.
Yet bill Mowbray's right hand the only hand he could have used to shoot himself had no gunshot residue and was virtually free of blood.
That left Susie Mowbray as the only other suspects but a respected blood spatter expert originally hired by the prosecution said there was no blood on the ground she was wearing when her husband was shot I could see you know stating whatsoever on it but either inside or outside so I told him at the time I should I don't see how she could have been in close proximity to the hatch bloating head literally bill mulberry I had a lot of tissue brain substance dura hair and skin that was blown all over the room.
Prosecutors claimed it was possible that Susie could have placed pillows and a blanket between herself and bill and that these received most of the blowback blood spatter but that blanket and the T. shirt Bill Murray was wearing when he was shot had been lost a serious blow to the prosecution meanwhile Susie Mowbray's defense team had its own problems they had to account for what many consider to be her unusual behavior just before and after the shooting.
She'S found out just before bill's death she was being cut out of his life insurance policies.
After he was shot she called a family friend before calling nine one one.
And within ten hours of his death.
She was painting the room where the shooting took place.
They were so fixed on the impropriety of the way she was acting in the way the times in the in the flow of traffic to our house and how she dealt with people and then the assertion to sit there drinking a drink when in fact it was probably water we had to get around the fact that she acted inappropriately.
Her defense also concentrated on bill Mowbray's behavior.
His business was in trouble he was being investigated for alleged tax irregularities ten years earlier he had actually attempted suicide.
And he told friends he would kill himself before spending one day in jail even told a co worker what funeral home he wanted to handle his money the R. S. was about to close in on him and he had no place to turn because whatever it was about his personality and the way it involved the only way out for him was to kill himself.
After two weeks Susie Mowbray second trial was nearing the end.
As the prosecutor made his closing argument the court room sat riveted and then there was a shocking development.
Which is totally unexpected although some think was choreographed but is totally unexpected she makes this outcry and really what it does for us is is gives us to relate that look we've done everything we can we have got her to the edge and now if something goes bad I'm just gonna look back and say.
It was Susie's fault the outburst was as close as Susie Mowbray would calm to testifying in her own defense.
After four hours of deliberation the jury came back with its verdict we the jury find the defendant as Mowbray also known as Susie Mowbray not guilty.
In a highly unusual move.
The jury foreman read a prepared statement shortly after the verdict for the more members of this jury have reached the conclusion that the only issue decided by this jury is that the prosecution was unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the defendant.
Jury members later said they couldn't speak to Susie's guilt or innocence only that the prosecution had not proved its case despite or perhaps because of that decision the case continues to generate controversy.
I can't be absolutely sure in a mathematical since she is the one who did it.
But I am sure that he did not shoot himself.
There was a physical impossibility for her to have killed her husband.
Susie Mowbray did not receive the insurance money.
She is considering writing a book.
I want my children to be proud of me I've been given.
A new lease on life so to speak.
I still don't know exactly what it will be.
