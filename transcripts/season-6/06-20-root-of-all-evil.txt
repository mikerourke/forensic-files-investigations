In nineteen eighty one witness claimed she solved the murder and cremation of a woman underneath the tree on a stretch of deserted farmland.
There was no trace of the remains anywhere nearby.
And investigators were stopped.
For answers they turned to the science of forensic geology.
Marshall Illinois is a small farming community just across the Wabash River from terra Haute Indiana.
The rich soil feeds vast fields of corn and acres of soybeans.
The biggest landowners in town with the crappy family Fred down Charlotte grabby were very prosperous both work the farm with their daughter son and daughter in law.
The Grammys had a lot going for them I mean they they had substantial resources inheritance Charlotte Graham he's part of the you know and and well into the six figures so these were not poor smallholder farmers.
Fred grabby was easy to spot at six foot four inches tall and close to three hundred pounds he dwarfed his petite wife.
Well when I first got into the family I thought.
Friend was very nice very polite he was fun to be around a really seem to like me.
They worked a lot.
Charlotte worked from daylight to dusk.
The Grammy marriage had its ups and downs like all marriages but this one had some unusual twists.
Fred Graham B. had an eye for younger women and shortly after he married Charlotte the couple divorced later they reconciled and married again.
But in nineteen eighty one Charlotte again ask for a divorce and Fred moved out of the main house into a smaller cabin on the farm.
The reason for the divorce this time was a friend was having an affair with the pretty twenty four year old bartender Vicky McAllister.
Not exactly the most successful person in that part of the world she tended bar she her reputation was not of the of the poorest.
On July twenty fourth nineteen eighty one Charlotte grabby left the house to cultivate soybeans on the farm.
The children expected or home by dinnertime but she never returned home.
When her children couldn't find her they contacted the local sheriff.
Fred told the sheriff that he had spoken to Charlotte earlier that day near a storage shed on the graph based farm and their conversation got heated.
They got into an argument he left the the machine should Charlotte pursued him in her car she got in her vehicle drove off and was last seen I let the last sorry driving up the interstate.
Last that was his story and consistently over time that's what he said.
In the shed authorities found Charlotte's on eaten lunch on her tractor.
Purse was also in the shed along with her migraine medication and driver's license.
And a neighbor said she saw Charlotte's car drive by earlier in the day but the driver did not appear to be Charlotte they saw friends pick up will buy and then they saw Charlotte car right behind it the blond curly haired woman driving it Charlotte rally as dark short hair straight hair a few days later Charlotte grab these car was found across the Indiana state line outside a bar in terra Haute.
Police found no.
No evidence of violence but they didn't recover fully loaded hand gun under the seat.
Investigators learned that Charlotte had written a letter shortly before she disappeared and back letter contained a warning.
Charlotte grab they disappeared from this remote field on her Illinois farm.
Just prior to her disappearance she asked her children to make a promise.
If she wasn't home by four thirty four thirty eight PM we were supposed to come and look for.
She was afraid of the man she was trying to divorce Fred grab me.
My dad would have fits of rage for seemingly no reason at all.
directed mainly towards my mother but sometimes toward my brother or myself more my brother than than me actually.
One particular instance I heard yelling sorry ran outside my brother and my my dad for fighting physically and my dad.
Took my brother by the side of the head and beat his head into the fender of the picked up.
Just ten days before she disappeared Charlotte left several notes in a safe deposit box in the local bank.
In the notes Charlotte accused her husband of stealing some farm equipment and said she didn't think she would live through a divorce she said she was afraid of Fred and also his friend and business associate Dale Kasler.
When police interviewed Dale Kasler he said he was home on the night Charlotte disappeared and that Fred grabby had been with him.
When a grand jury asked Fred Graham B. about his whereabouts on the day Charlotte disappeared he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to testify.
With no evidence of a crime the official investigations stalled.
Charlotte grabby became yet another missing person.
Despite a twenty five thousand dollar reward posted by the grand children Charlotte's disappearance remained a mystery for the next three years.
That'S all I thought about from the time I got up to the time I went to bed every night how my gonna find my mom she could be a life out there somewhere.
Probably not that she might be and I had to go on that possibility and I kept thinking you know if it were me she would never give up.
With nowhere else to turn in nineteen eighty four Charlotte's daughter hired a private detective Charles Pearson.
Your son discovered that Fred grab they had recently broken up with his long time girlfriend Vicky McAllister and Pearson tracked her down in Indiana.
Almost from the start Vicky McAllister scenes anxious to talk about her life with Fred grabbing.
He was able to.
To play on her emotions and to draw from her a horrible secret.
It was the secret to Charlotte grab these disappearance and the story was so horrific it was difficult to believe.
Vicky claimed that she went to the shed to borrow a steel drum from Fred the holes.
When they heard Charlotte drive up Fred told the key to hide behind a tractor.
Charlotte and Fred immediately began to argue and soon turned by.
From what Vicky McAllister told us.
Fred actually choke Charlotte several times and then would let up on the pressure led to regain consciousness and then the joker again making comments during the whole time.
They said that after grabbing choke Charlotte to death he sodomized her.
Afterwards he used a grease gun to fill every orifice of her body to make it more flammable.
He then put her body in the trash barrels and headed towards the river.
Vicky drove Charlotte's car and abandoned it over the state line in Indiana.
Later that night Fred douse the body in diesel fuel and while Vicky watched Fred burned the body.
The fire lasted throughout the night.
Happy through it in the Wabash River saying that it would make good fish filled.
The story when you hear the whole thing it's really kind of hard to believe.
It was almost overwhelming.
Of course I cried a lot and.
Over the course of the next few days.
It had to sink in because there just was so much to it you know and it was so horrific as you say.
I just kept praying that my mom didn't go through any pain.
McAlister had plenty of motive to tell a story that would put Fred grant beacon press.
There'S no greater assets than that of a spurned woman she may have originally been concerned with long term relationship with another lesson for certain period of time and then ended.
And I think choosing Ricky came to expect if not be told that she would share in the dynasty or the financial dynasty of the Grammy family that she would become a part of everything and that they she and Fred would would live happily ever after I mean that's a story that guys tell girls and girls and often believe.
In exchange for her testimony Vicky McAllister was offered total immunity relocation and a new identity.
And this crappy was convicted McAllister could claim twenty five thousand dollar reward offered by the grab the children.
Any time you have just one person's word against another it's always better to have some type of physical evidence but there was another living witness to the events of that terrible night three years earlier.
And that evidence would tell if Vicky McAllister story actually has the ring of truth.
Read Dr these ex girlfriend Vicky McAllister took police to the scene of the cremation which she says took place on the banks of the Wabash River just underneath this mature maple trees.
But after three years there were no remains found anywhere in the vicinity I was with one of the attorney general's that was assisting our state's attorney in the prosecution of the case.
But I made a comment to just wondering if that this burn site if there is any possibility that petroleum products from the diesel fuel that was used could still be recovered in the soil around the site.
Since the Wabash River frequently overflows in the area of the maple tree any traces of the diesel fuel in the soil would have long been washed away.
One piece of potential evidence survived.
The maple tree under which the funeral pyre allegedly burned.
Trees make excellent history books because they show us when events occurred.
Nearby the tree they can explain to us exactly when different events happened.
In this photo sheriff Crumrine is standing on the spot the barrel was allegedly placed.
Was there any way for science to corroborate Vicky McAlister's story.
In the spring and summer routes transport water and nutrients from the surrounding soil up through the trunk and into a tree's branches where they fuel the growth of very large cells.
When the tree goes dormant in late summer and fall it produces smaller more dense sales.
This cycle produces the familiar rings we see when we cut a tree branch or trunk each ring indicates another year has passed.
If the trees absorb diesel fuel from the gruesome funeral pyre.
Was there any way to tell diesel fuel is a toxic material to trees it will either kill the cells or it will affect their growth rate their metabolism adversely when it's absorbed by the tree it will slow the growth rate of the cells that it's in contact with.
Investigators caught five branches from the tree and when they counted back through the growth rings they saw something startling in nineteen eighty one the growth of those branches had dramatically slowed from what it had been in previous years.
Gross rains from the year Charlotte disappeared for much thinner than earlier rings.
It was no way of knowing why this was somehow to find out.
He says of each branch were ground into saw dust and given to Dr Donald Dickerson an organic chemist.
Dickerson dissolved the samples and injected the sample into a gas chromatograph.
The results indicated the presence of hydrocarbons compounds indicative of petroleum products.
Even more startling only two of the five branches showed traces of petroleum the ones on the side of the tree where Vicky McAllister said the cremation took place several other circuitry negative four hundred garments some species of trees will translocate or carry the material laterally around the tree better than others maple trees in general tend to maintain fairly direct columns between the roots and the branches above.
A unique forensic approach had uncovered evidence that matched Vicky McAllister is bizarre and horrifying story exactly.
Heck of a coincidence.
John o'brien spent forty years as a crime reporter for the Chicago Tribune in the Boondocks of Marshall Illinois to wait out in Clark County I don't think there's another crime that comes close to not only the murder of a Charlotte grabby and the means in which your body was disposed of.
But the story doesn't end here.
Another mysterious fire.
Attempted prison break and the murder of one of the grab the children all to impact Fred grab these try.
When scientists discovered hydrocarbons in the maple tree next to where Charlotte grabbed his body was allegedly incinerated Fred Grandy was arrested and charged with murder.
The star witness was Fred grabby sex girlfriend Vicky McAllister who was given immunity to testify.
Her story both fascinated and horrified courtroom spectators the first time I think I heard about the tree was when it came out in court.
To me proves that he was telling the truth about everything.
The motive money Fred Grandy had no desire to split the family assets with his wife even though it was Charlotte's inheritance which comprised the bulk of their holdings.
Most of the farm ground that they had it's my understanding belong to her through her side of the family and a friend was going to lose a lot of money basically that's what all amounted to.
If the love of money is the root of all evil the roots of the maple trees soaking up Aaron diesel fuel sealed Fred crappy state.
Fred grabbing was convicted of first degree murder in the death of his wife and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
In a bizarre twist to a bizarre story Fred grab these new girlfriend Barbara Graham armed with a gun arrived at the jail one night and attempted to get him out of prison she fired five shots wounding one deputy in the leg.
For that offense Barbara Graham was sentenced to sixteen years in prison.
Two months later the home Fred and Charlotte shared and the house their children Jeff and Cindy had built next door burned to the ground.
Arson investigators discovered both fires were deliberately set.
I believe Fred grabby probably had some involvement with the not setting the fires directly but I believe he probably had some involvement we'll never know probably.
Fred grab these lawyers appealed the first verdict and on a technicality won a new trial.
A month before the second trial Fred's son Jeff grabbed eight testified against his father at the first trial was found murdered in California with three bullet wounds to the chest.
We were notified by seal beach California authorities that they had found the body of just grab me floating in one of the harbors out there.
To this day some believe Fred grabby had a hand in his son's murder although Fred denies it.
I don't know if he had that kind of Paul for people who get sent out to California I I don't think so but I there's a lot of things I don't know.
The second trial ended the same way as the first.
And grabbing was found guilty of murder and sentenced to seventy five years in prison I wrote him a letter.
Telling him that I forgave him for what he did.
I hate what he did but I still love him because he's my dad if that makes sense.
And no trace of Charlotte grab these remains have ever been recovered.
Vicky McAllister plane to reward then left the area relocated at the state's expense.
She continues to fear that friend Robbie will somehow take revenge from behind prison bars.
The maple trees still grows not far from the Wabash River.
The maple tree alive and growing.
A friend grabby could not intimidate could not reach could not destroy.
