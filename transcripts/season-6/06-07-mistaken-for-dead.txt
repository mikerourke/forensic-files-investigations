In nineteen eighty eight a patient in southern California collapsed and died of a heart attack in his doctor's office.
But like many Hollywood stories it was pure fiction.
Investigators suspected that the patient and his doctor were one of several characters involved in a real life murder mystery.
Dr Richard Boggs was a Harvard educated neurologist in Glendale California a short drive from Hollywood.
He had been married had children and had a huge mansion had for all intents and purposes the the good life drove a rolls Royce the wife drove a jaguar.
Early one Saturday morning in April of nineteen eighty eight.
Dr blogs called nine one one to report that the patient had died in his office of an apparent heart attack.
He said he performed an electrocardiogram which appeared normal.
But when you momentarily stepped out of the examining room.
The patient collapsed on the floor.
By the time paramedics arrived at seven fifteen AM.
Dr bugs identified the man as forty two year old Jean Hanson who he said had been a patient for years.
Anson'S identity was confirmed by credit cards and the birth certificate in his wallet.
But paramedics were suspicious because the body was cold and rigor mortis had set in.
Sergeant James Lowry was one of the first police officers who arrived on the scene the arteries or veins it would be in the face.
Seem to be broken there seem to be up watching this to it having seen lots of doubts both natural and unnatural.
It was my impression at looking at this body that he had been deceased for quite some time.
The coroner estimated the time of death by comparing the temperature of Hanson's liver with the room temperature.
The body temperature drops a degree and a half every hour after death.
The temperature of the room was seventy two degrees the temperature of the body was eighty seven degrees based on that just a rough guess it would indicate that it was anywhere from maybe six to seven hours since the person have died.
Which meant that Hanson died between two and three o'clock in the morning long before Dr Boggs had called paramedics I told off the box that says you're nothing but a liar I don't believe you everything you've told us a lot.
As the son of the position sergeant Lowry knew something was amiss.
Dr Boggs was an urologist trained in treating brain and other neurologic problems so why was he treating a patient for chest pains.
And doctor Baden's appearance gave no indication that he had performed CPR.
I looked at doctor box and his clothes were not messy he wasn't covered in sweat his hair was still neatly combed.
Having done CPR in the field myself I know how exhausting that is.
There were too many inconsistencies for the police to accept I knew that this person had died the way the doctor box it told us but I thought there may be some other explanation I didn't know if this had been some type of a romantic encounter I didn't know if this has been some type of a drug overdose I mean there are other possible explanations for what had gone on here.
And in the search of doctor Boggs office police discovered some unusual devices not found in most medical offices.
What was found during the course of the search warrant phase where various sex toy.
That were actually within the examination room of the doctor I mean the little cabinets with drawers that was in there while the doctor was seen patients which was really kind of a bizarre way to run a business.
Just two weeks earlier police had responded to another incident in Dr Boggs office a man will refer to as Bruce Smith claimed the doctor Boggs attacked him in his office with a stun gun after.
Since the two met earlier that night at a gay bar police concluded it was a lovers spat.
In recent years doctor Bob's experience both professional and personal difficulties.
He lost his medical privileges at several hospitals he had gone through a divorce and had admitted publicly that he was a homosexual.
And police discovered the doctor Boggs was a regular at clubs specializing in sadomasochism.
You could say that in a sense for outlaws sexual outlaws the activities that they engage and are probably not legitimately recognized in the community as consensual play.
Police hope an autopsy would reveal what really happened and doctor box office.
Police were stunned when the autopsy confirmed exactly what Dr Boggs said said because Jean Hanson's death non specific focal myocarditis a heart.
Hanson'S body was positively identified by his business partner John Hawkins.
Hansen and Hawkins owned a clothing company in Columbus Ohio called just sweats.
This is a television commercial for just sweats John Hawkins was a regular performer in this box one week only lightweight Switzer thirty percent off just.
It appeared that they had a tremendous agogo business they had something like twenty clothing stores they were driving in fancy cars living in very high life.
Jean Hanson's body was cremated and the ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean.
John Hawkins was the sole beneficiary of his partner's estate which included a one million dollar life insurance policy.
After the funeral falcons returned to Ohio and then back.
The drovers convertible Mercedes to the airport and left at with the top down in Columbus Ohio rainy weather hopped on a plane with and now a million dollars in cash.
Some time later an employee at the insurance company was closing out her file on Jean Hanson and requested a copy of Hanson's driver's license.
California driver's licenses include not only a photograph but also some.
Print on Hansen's driver's license did not match the thumb print taken in the morgue after his death.
And the insurance company reported this discrepancy to police.
After looking through their files police discovered that the thirty two year old Hollywood accountant had been reported missing.
His name was Alice green.
When the photograph of Dr Barnes patient was shown to other screens family they positively identified him.
When confronted by police Dr Boggs said he was shocked he said the man who died in his office with a patient for years and it's always been known as Jean Hanson.
But lieutenant Perkins took a closer look at Jean Hanson's medical file and found a starkly inconsistency.
During three different office visits Dr Boggs perform EKG examinations on Jean Hanson.
But when lieutenant Perkins place the EKG strips end to end he noticed ink marks and other printing evidence that showed that the three EKG tests were all performed on the same day.
When I placed each of the cages trips in the end the broken part of the actual EKG strips all match perfectly and the red dye matched up to the other one and then the the end that was only halfway mark with a red dye matched up with the other one that did not have any die on it whatsoever.
He actually gives tomorrow which really made us our job a whole lot easier so this was the first time that we could really say beyond a reasonable doubt that this was a phony or forced medical file.
Investigators then decided to take a second look at the autopsy.
Other screens blood and tissue samples were sent from more sophisticated testing including gas chromatography which can identify hundreds of toxic chemicals in human tissue but none were found.
Next a second forensic pathologist was brought in to review the initial autopsy findings.
The new path all the just noticed signs of discoloration and Mr green space and finger tips an indication of suffocation such discoloration is often very subtle and disappear so quickly after death which is why suffocation sometimes goes undetected.
Despite doctor Boggs claim of innocence he was arrested on suspicion of murder.
But did he act alone or was John Hawkins involved and where was the real Jean Hanson.
When investigators look into Dr Richard Boggs background they discovered that despite his fancy lifestyle he was penniless he had recently gone through a divorce and also lost a large amount of money in a failed business venture.
One of the bathrooms.
The bathtub filled with water a just a just overflowing amount of bills that the doctor.
And when they looked into the Ohio clothing business owned by Jean Hanson and John Hawkins they found the same thing huge financial losses one of the ways out of there the Lima.
You can make a lot of money.
for life insurance.
Very attractive proposition.
If the murderous Alice green was an insurance scam investigators were certain Dr Richard Boggs Jean Hanson and John Hawkins were all involved I don't know how they met I know that both Hawkins and Hanson had been patients of doctor Boggs and they don't know each other for many years.
Lands for Hanson staged murder may have put on a full year early phone records show the trio was in constant communication.
Phone records set up for us the conspiracy every time they prepared to do something in this case you saw an increase in phone activity between all three individuals.
After buying a one million dollar insurance policy Jean Hanson told his friends and colleagues that he was dying of aids which wasn't true and he said he was moving to California.
Before he left he made John Hawkins the sole beneficiary of his estate eliminating his family from his will.
This is a case that involved elaborate planning to make sure there's no mistake that some bereaved relative of the truth Mr Hansen such as his mother doesn't show up and say wait a second the save my care.
Police believe that Hanson and Boggs Matt Ellis green in a north Hollywood bar.
Green was at the wrong place at the wrong time and he filled all the requirements they were looking for he resembled Hanson was HIV positive and was very very drunk.
From what we know green was a very affable friendly man and they probably invited him to join them and he went along with them and not having any clue as to what his fate was going to be.
The very moment paramedics were attempting to resuscitate on the screen and doctor Boggs office a man matching Jean Hanson's description checked into this hotel just two blocks from the box office under an alias later the real Jean Hanson received a telephone call from John falcons in Ohio.
And when Ellis green was pronounced dead John Hawkins flew to California from high identified green's body as that of his partner Jean Jean Hanson at the body cremated and collected the one million dollars from the life insurance policy.
Then Hawkins and the real Jean Hanson both vanished leaving behind their bankrupt clothing company and Dr Richard Boggs to defend himself against murder charges.
The hunt for Jean Hanson and John Hawkins would take more than three years and lead halfway around the world.
As Dr Richard Boggs sat in a California jail for the murder of Alice green his conspirators Jean Hanson and John Hawkins we're still on the run.
A tip led police to this house in Florida and the fingerprints found on the drinking glass positively identified Jean Hanson as the resident but evidence inside the home indicated Hanson had fled the country.
A few months later Hanson was arrested at the Dallas fort worth airport after arriving on a flight from Mexico.
Security personnel noticed he was behaving suspiciously.
The scars from numerous plastic surgeries and hair transplants were still noticeable.
He denied he was Jean Hanson and he had other screens driver's license in his possession.
He also had several false ID's and a book entitled how to create a new identity.
His fingerprints matched those of the Rio Jean Hanson and he was arrested.
Finding John Hawkins was much harder John Hawkins was a chameleon he could lose his way into any lifestyle to to any location four seed money to to assist along the way.
For three years falcons use the insurance money to travel the world.
Tonight on America's most wanted.
In Amsterdam a woman saw a television program in which John Hawkins was identified as being wanted in connection with the murder of Alice green.
The woman was one of Hawkins former lovers.
With the information she provided authorities found Hawkins off the coast of Sardinia in a red catamaran called Kerr PTM sees the day.
When they confronted him John Hopkins was a very nasty individual he said what I'm not we think I am a brother Brian and the English citizen here's my passport he presented a a legitimate British passport and that and he accused him of making a terrible error as to his identification.
John Hawkins was positively identified through fingerprints prosecutors believe that financial problems brought Boggs Hansen and Hawkins together in an insurance scam which would net them one million dollars.
Dr bods assignment was to identify and nurture a lookalike for Jean Hanson.
His first target was Bruce Smith Boggs picked up in a gay bar took him back to his office and attacked him with a stun gun.
Two weeks later Dr Boggs was joined by Jean Hanson and together they tried it once again.
Bogs and Hanson met Alice green at a night club sometime around midnight.
We had a blood alcohol level of point two eight and was very drunk.
Once it has took him back to box office and attacked him with a stun gun.
Okay you just get out of here I can hear.
We'Ll talk to Dr Barnes made numerous medical mistakes which were his downfall.
He killed green sometime after midnight but he didn't call emergency personnel until seven AM.
By the time they arrived the body was cold and rigor mortis had set a.
John Hawkins Jean Hansen and Dr Richard Boggs were charged with murder conspiracy insurance fraud and grand theft.
At the trial.
Prosecutors presented forensic evidence that Alison green had been suffocated by doctor bonds and the real Jean Hanson was in town on the day of the murder checking into a nearby hotel just as the paramedics arrived.
The defense argued the Dallas green died of natural causes primarily due to the extremely high level of alcohol in his bloodstream.
The jury didn't agree.
Dr Boggs and Jean Hanson were convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder and insurance fraud both were sentenced to life in prison without parole.
John Hawkins was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and insurance fraud and sentenced to twenty five years to life I think it was a a great result I think we brought three men to justice thanks to great investigators great experts and people.
who pulled together from you know all over the world.
Solid police work and forensic evidence help solve one crime and may have prevented another investigators discovered evidence that the trio was planning another murder this time off Hawkins lookalike in order to cash in on another million dollars life insurance policy.
