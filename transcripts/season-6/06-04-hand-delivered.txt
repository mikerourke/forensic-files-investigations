In nineteen ninety five police in California received an anonymous letter which identified a pair of severed hands as those of a navy pilot who had been murdered.
The letter described the murder in gruesome detail.
Investigators search for some clue to the identity of the author and the killer.
San Diego the second largest city in California it's bay is one of the finest natural harbours in the world and is home to one of the largest naval bases in the country.
In nineteen ninety four workers at the San Diego fibers corporation were sifting through some cardboard in a recycling bin.
They made a gruesome discovery.
To human hands.
First I wasn't sure that this was a legitimate I thought you know a pair of human hands found in dumpsters seemed a little bit strange and we've collected evidence as if it was a a normal homicide with a complete body this was a little bit different because all we all we had were hands.
X. rays showed degenerative damage of the joints consistent with an individual over age sixty and the size of the fingers and knuckles indicated they were man's hands.
The right hand had one distinctive feature.
Detectives checked local hospitals and morgues to see if they have the body of an elderly man without hands.
On the other side of town Mary Mead and Terry Holland were beginning to worry they hadn't seen their father don harden in more than a week and I called everybody I could possibly get a hold up have you seen him have you heard from him nobody had heard anything.
So I think that's the point where I really got scared because I thought where would he have gone it's very hard to explain you you go through scared.
And then almost an anger.
And then worry.
When police learned the don harden was missing the thumb nail of his right hand they knew immediately and the fingerprint analysis confirmed that the hands were those of seventy four year old retired navy pilot don harden.
It'S a shock I felt that that we were in some.
Adlai produced please story from TV I mean this doesn't happen in real life and it just really threw us for a little.
When homicide detectives search done hardens home they found evidence of robbery television the C. R. and microwave oven we're all missing so was harden's pickup truck.
The TV guide was opened the March twenty eight which was probably the last day don Fardon was home.
Small drops of blood were found in the kitchen and it appeared that detergents and bleach had been used to wash the kitchen and bathroom floors.
We were under the impression that it was either a missing persons report or a theft involved with a missing person.
You never lose hope never lose hope.
Don harden was a widower would move to San Diego a few years earlier to be near his daughter's.
Neighbors described harden as ordinary and difficult but his daughter is remembered him as a loving father.
One of my Terry Stotts that I have of him is that every time I spoke to him on the telephone at the end of our conversation I always said I love you dad and he'd say I love you to get out.
Pardon had a history of helping those in need he often hired homeless man to do odd jobs around his property and he often let them live in a camper in his backyard.
We were very comforting knowing that there was somebody there in case of an emergency that.
My father could be taken care of immediately well I think that's really great there's a guy there that can kind of keep an eye on Daddy's kind of a companion to dad is in some you know someone to talk to help them out you know I felt good about it.
Police were on the lookout for the items stolen from harden's home.
We in fact did recover some of Mr harden's property was I believe it was a wallet in a driver's license and maybe some army medals and we follow that up on that to find out if we could that would lead back to suspect it website kind of a dead end it was found in a dumpster and we really couldn't put that back to a viable suspect investigators had no idea what happened to the rest of Tom hardy's body.
But they suspected.
Something terrible happened inside his home.
A pair of severed hands found at the San Diego recycling plant were identified as those of seventy four year old don Harton a retired navy pilot.
A search of harden's home revealed evidence of burglary and violence we were in the kitchen and the kitchen floor had a fine white powdery substance.
Unevenly applied over the whole floor was pretty obvious that some cleanser had been used to clean the floor up we noticed that there were blood.
Blood spots throughout the carpet which led from the kitchen.
Around through the living room and towards the bathroom.
Behind the hamper detectives found a blood stain and some human tissue inside the heating great.
To find out whether blood had been cleaned up detectives administered luminol a chemical which four races when it comes into contact with the iron component of blood even after it has been removed with water and detergent.
The blood itself it helps you find it so it it doesn't compromise the evidence it just helps you locate the evidence it helps you find a scenario as far as what happened it's a presumptive it's not conclusive but it's a tool that we use.
After spring the luminol the lights are extinguished and the camera with high speed film captures the images.
It was the largest global luminol I had ever seen in my life it's close like a Christmas tree.
Police found a huge amount of blood on the kitchen floor and a blood trail leading from the kitchen to the bathroom.
And in the bathroom there was even more blunt.
DNA tests revealed the blood was done hardens.
The amount of blood lead forensic pathologist to conclude that harden could not have survived such a devastating attack.
I go over to the couch and we sit down and he says there is positive proof.
That your father was killed in the kitchen and he was dismembered in the bathroom.
And he is dead the positive proof that he is dead it didn't sink in for for quite some time.
But there's there's disbelief there is the question why.
what could have possibly provoked it.
Harden led a simple life in retirement.
Similar to other naval retirees in San Diego so who would want him dead.
And who would go to such lengths to conceal the murder.
The day before he disappeared neighbors saw don harden with one of the homeless man he allowed to live in his back yard camper.
His name was Dale with a forty one year old drifter who had a police record for vagrancy and intoxication but no past history of violence.
With merit denied any knowledge of don Hartman's whereabouts.
With Merced that harden had loaned him the pick up truck but hadn't seen him since he said he worked hard on and off for years he said he regarded the old man almost like a father.
Dale had told other people neighbors that the old man was bothering him and that was that he was really getting mad and that he was tired of the old man poking him and calling him names and belittling him.
I want you to take your time when you look at it closely during the police interrogation Witmer was shown a photograph of the severed hands.
And we asked him how he could know such a thing he just said he'd grown accustomed to seeing them over the years that they've been together and and then he just recognize them as being Mr hardened hands but what I would say no more.
When police asked him to take a lie detector test your review.
Whitmer'S fingerprints were found inside hardens home but since he did odd jobs for harden this wasn't unusual.
The swimmer was very nonchalant and.
He talked to us and have an answer for almost every question that we had.
And just told us that I don't know where is he asked me to do a few things form I was driving his truck because you let me he asked me to take some things from his house and give them to other people and I did.
With no other leads the case of done hardens disappearance went unsolved for over a year.
Until police received an anonymous letter that contained details of gone hardens merger that hadn't been released to the public.
Iran seek evidence indicated the don harden had been murdered inside his home but all investigators ever recovered were his severed hands.
More than a year after don Harkins disappearance police received a tip.
An anonymous letter arrived at police headquarters containing details about don hardens murder.
When I read it I realized that whoever wrote the letter or provide the information for the letter.
Knew something about our crime there were things in the letter that only a suspect when no I got really excited about it the writer said that his friend Bob had identified don hardens killer.
He was murdered by deal with.
Who abused him by hitting him with a cane if you didn't work hard enough.
Deals a heroin addict leaves behind Mr harden's home for a year or so before the murder.
You put the body into the bathtub dismembered his body put in garbage bags.
A different bags all over the county in Mexico.
Harden'S dismemberment in the bath tub was the information that had not been released to the public.
The letter went on to say that Bob would not come forward to testify against Dale with.
I asked him to contact you directly but he didn't feel like he could do it.
Bob is convinced the Dale will know Bob is the source of the information may try to silence him or hurt him in some way.
It was clear that the writer of the letter wanted to help but did not want to get involved.
The forensic documents office at the San Diego police department analyzed the letter and look at the post mark.
The letter wasn't nailed with stamps but it's gone through a postal meter the type businesses normally use.
Each postal meter prince a number on the envelope which is the meters registration number.
But the writer had covered the number with the white ink internet for to conceal the letters are rich in.
We can look at letters for trace evidence late Nevins and in this case obliterated evidence and quite often find something that would allow us to source that document but we can always.
Using what is known as a video spectral comparator various light sources and filter combinations can often reveal what is hidden underneath eight and markers.
The first attempt to see the meter number were unsuccessful.
So Hugh Curfman the operator of the comparator tried looking through the opposite side of the envelope by cutting it in half.
He then used a blue green light to penetrate the whiting.
And it worked.
So it's pretty clear image and.
Detective Lange looked at quickly said well there it is.
The number of the meter five one nine seven four five one.
The serial number revealed the state.
City street name and office address of the postal meter.
It was located at Davis capital management in la mesa California.
The owner of the company was mark Davis who was also a bishop in the Mormon church.
When confronted by police Davis admitted that he wrote the anonymous letter the source of his information was a member of his church.
But Davis refused to identify the source.
Citing the religious privilege that exists between the clergy and church member.
Prosecutors took mark Davis the court and the judge ruled against him.
The religious from the turtle is not absolute in the sense that not every communication with a virgin men is protected in this instance the judge found that there was actually a good argument that this was not protected by the priest editor clergyman penitent privilege.
The court ruled that the information might have been privileged at one time but once Davis wrote the letter to police the privilege was broken.
Mark Davis complied with the court ruling and identified the source of the information.
Bob was deal with Murray's own daughter Andrea.
She was the trickiest most difficult most sensitive witness we had to deal with in that she loves her father.
Even though he had murdered this man and and that's something that you would expect.
She also never expected to be found out yes she was and she was dragged into this deal with murder was arrested and charged with murder.
On September fifteenth nineteen ninety seven Dale Witmer went on trial for the murder of don harden he pleaded not guilty.
The star witness against him his daughter Andrea found herself in a difficult position if she lies on the stand to protect her father she betrays her god she tells the truth on the stand she is true to her religion but she betrays her father which would you choose if your entry with.
Andria Witmer chose to tell the truth.
And she corroborated everything that Martin Davis had written in his letter.
The letter said Dale Witmer was a heroin addict and desperately needed money.
Prosecutors believe that on March twenty eighth nineteen ninety four deal with America walked into don hardens kitchen and killed.
The motive was robbery and revenge for past abusive treatment.
The luminal evidence suggests that harden was bleeding profusely in the kitchen and the body was dismembered in a bath tub.
Traces of blood and human tissue were found behind the hamper on the heating great.
Which later removed the blood evidence with water and detergents but the iron component in the blood was easily detected by the luminol.
With more stole hardens T. V. VI C. R. and microwave oven and sold the items to buy drugs.
Witmer disposed of harden's body parts in numerous dumpsters throughout San Diego and Mexico.
The hands with the only part of don hardens body ever recover.
The jury found Dale with America guilty of second degree murder.
Don Harkins doctors asked for permission to address the court before sentencing which wasn't an easy thing to do.
He almost got away with committing this hideous crime I am grateful he'll be in prison and not able to inflict himself on another family this ordeal has renewed my faith in the criminal justice system.
I find myself still wanting to pick up the telephone call this is a chilling for.
Dale with murder was sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison.
We were unable to prosecute him but for the moment all work and of course our.
There was a probability that we would have known who did it but we would never been able to prove that.
Obviously finding the hands was important case but the forensics allowed us to examine the scene and find the amount of blood loss that.
There was there at the scene the extent of the scene and obviously the envelope played a very very big part in this case I.
The hope that with all the forensic technology that they have.
We'Ve been thinking of doing any kind of wrongdoing.
They'Ll stop and think about it before they do it because the with all the forensic technology that's out there they're going to be caught.
After the trial don harden's hands were cremated and his ashes were buried by the U. S. navy at sea off the coast of California.
After was all over we just felt so much better.
Over his final wishes.
