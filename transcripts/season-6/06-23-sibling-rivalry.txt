This is the story of two brothers who were at one time the undisputed kings of pornography in America.
Their empire crumbled in nineteen ninety one when one of the brothers was murdered some say.
In cold blood.
The Mitchell brothers had their share of enemies but it took crime scene reconstruction.
San Francisco California the city by the bay.
The Golden Gate Bridge.
And Alcatraz prison all sides of the landscape.
There'S another side to this city one born during the gold rush days when it was a busy seaport.
The sexual Congress a tradition that has lived on today because of the city's well known tolerance for sexual expression.
It was here where two brothers RT and Jim Mitchell broke into the adult sex business first as filmmakers.
Making the ten minute X. rated films customers watch with a handful of quarters.
Eventually the brothers expanded into the theater business at their peak the brothers owned eleven adult movie theaters across California.
The crown jewel of their operation was the Farrell theater in San Francisco.
Here the brothers went beyond movies and offered live sex shows and a new cabaret act.
Allman says went far beyond anything else that was offered in the city and was another financial success.
Author David McCumber in his book X. rated says that if Jim Mitchell was the brains of the operation RT was its genitals.
Many future stars got their start at the Farrell theater including Nina Hartley and Marilyn chambers.
Chambers went on to star in the Mitchell brothers first X. rated feature length film behind the green door it was an instant hit grossing over thirty five million dollars for those people haven't seen behind the green door.
It is a story about a woman who is abducted taken against her will and at one point she gets into it because she's and she's loved and she's never been loved before by six women a black man six guys on trap and entrap he's just really bizarre things by all accounts RT was the Wilder the two earning the nicknames merry prankster and party RT.
Jim played the part of the responsible older brother.
It was way more flamboyant than Jim Jim was what what's kind of the introvert and art was the extrovert and although they weren't the same age you would never know what they were they were like twins the good twin and battling.
Not surprisingly RT also had problems in his personal life by the time he was in his forties it's been through two divorces six kids numerous child support and custody battles and developed and almost done quintuple appetite for drugs alcohol and sadomasochistic sex I was thinking that we can go.
On February twenty first nineteen ninety one.
RT faced another problem.
Just after ten PM.
An intruder broke through the front door of his home and opened fire.
Hi Julie ran to the closet and call police at the door.
By the time paramedics arrived forty five year old arty Mitchell was dead on the bathroom floor with the fatal bullet wound to his head.
When police arrived at the home of pornographer arty Mitchell.
They saw a middle aged man walking away from the murder scene with a limp carrying an umbrella.
What was making walks deflated with a rifle butt sticking out of his family I drew my service revolver and I also ordered him to stop instead he started walking faster then he stopped and attempted to pull out his life.
The man surrendered.
And told police he was also carrying a handgun.
It was Jim Mitchell the victim's brother.
As he sat in the back of a patrol car.
You made an interesting statement to police they said something to the effect that I know I'm in trouble I want a lawyer I was.
I mean it was just so.
Out of context for the for what you considered the Mitchell brothers to be you know what the future is going to be like that certainly did not include it.
In the days leading up to the shooting Jim said that RT's behavior had spiraled completely out of control.
RT have threatened the lives of his ex wife as well as Jim's girlfriend and also made a threatening phone calls to their mother.
RT sex wife Karen confirmed that already had resisted any plan to get help.
RT was acting very violent he didn't want to check into the hospital and he had told us that he'd rather die than checking on special.
Jim said he went to RT's home to force him into a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program something RT at strenuously resisted for months.
Jim said he took a gun for his own defense and said that when RT came out of the bedroom he was holding what looked like a gun.
He fired seven shots three RT for Mister mark.
Ballistic test revealed that all of the shots fired from Jim's rifles.
It'S not a question of when and then the person did it it's a question of his level of culpability and what was his mental state what was in his mind RT had a blood alcohol level of point two five almost three times the legal limit is art was not killed this way I would have.
Died in his car and take a lot of other people with them or overdosed on something it was it was inevitable that art was not going to be around in this world for a lot I thought defense attorney said that what happened between the two brothers wasn't a murder at all this is not a murder case never has been a race case it's a tragic accident an accident of the vehicles proportions homicide investigators weren't persuaded by GM's version of the shooting.
The bullet holes at the crime scene workgroup closely together.
But investigators needed to know the sequence of the shots and the timing of what took place.
For that all they had was the nine one one call to police.
For any of the gun shots captured on the audio.
To find out investigators hired a forensic a construction Dr Harry Holly.
What'S going on Dr Helene heard some popping and static sounds but further tests were needed to see if they were twenty two caliber gunshot.
Well I would have been real surprised if it wasn't a twenty two but none the less we had to go ahead and do some other analyses to be to insure that we know what we are talking about.
Dr Harleen son Kevin analyzed the sounds with the spectrogram which shows a graphical representation of everything on the tape.
Three static and other noises can match the sound of gunfire.
But gunshots have a distinct sound wave pattern regardless of the weapons make or signs.
It looks kind of like a final site plan side ways we got the big flat face and then it tapers off to a point.
And that the amount of time that it that it takes to do that is one of the one of things you look at the frequencies that it runs in it at that time is another thing look at.
After analyzing the tape Kevin how lean identified five gunshots.
What were they all from a twenty two caliber rifle.
To find out forensic acoustic shins usually test fire and record the murder weapon at the crime scene for comparison.
But RT Mitchell's home was no longer available to police since it had been sold shortly after the merger I suddenly realize that my house was acoustically very similar.
So Dr Harleen set up a makeshift firing range inside his own home.
This glassed in porch would double as the whole way in RT's.
A bucket filled with wet newspapers coughed the ball.
To recreate the recording made of the shooting Dr Harleen placed telephone in a nearby room and recorded the shots through the open line.
The murder weapon was fired and recorded over the telephone.
The test firings were compared to the shots on the police audio tape.
Since the test firings were done in a different home with different acoustics there would be some differences but there were many similarities.
When we got the results back we began to see that we had made a match and this was indeed the gun that was used in the in the incident.
Dr Harleen believes that the five crackling sounds on the nine one one tape work five of the seven gunshots fired from the murder weapon.
The first two shots happened before the call was made.
Investigators next step was to determine the time between each gunshot.
In order to recreate the crime exactly as it happened.
Prosecutors wanted to recreate the shooting of arty Mitchell to determine whether it was an accident or murder.
Laser test identified the direction of each of the seven shots next the blood spatter evidence and the sequence of the shots recorded on the nine one one audio tape all help to piece together the events.
Investigators knew RT was standing when hit in the shoulder.
All that hole through the wall call responded perfectly with the height at the shoulder.
This was a unique case because of the nature of the of the gunshots and ricochets in the tracing of the.
After the bullets in trying to place the victim in certain spots.
The crime scene reconstruction revealed Jim broke into the home and immediately fired the first shot down the hall.
Through the right side of RT's bedroom door.
The second shot went through the same door just as it was opening.
As already stepped into the hole.
Shot number three ricocheted off of the bedroom door frame went into the bedroom and landed on the dresser.
The fourth shot RT in the abdomen.
And came out through his back.
The fifth shot went through the bathroom walls.
And into a shoulder and for the next twenty eight seconds.
There were no shots fired.
The significance of that if in fact there's a gap in the gun shots would be that someone is waiting watching taking for the next shot is fired based on the bullet angle trajectory prosecutors believe Jim knelt down at this point and took a.
He was killed instantly.
The seventh and final shot the whole way entrance.
Prosecutors believe the shooting was intentional and was not an accident he had to aim for because it was the evidence finally showed that that the fatal shot actually occurred when the victim poked his head out the bathroom door and it already been shot two times.
At that point.
The forensic analysis was invaluable in reconstructing the crime.
With this information.
Jim Mitchell was charged with murder.
The hardest part for prosecutors would be explaining the shooting to a jury in a way they could understand.
So the district attorney decided to try something never done before he would ask the judge to allow the forensic animation into evidence I know we're gonna have a big fight on our hands because I think in what at twenty seven second video I think it was if that it's basically summarized the whole case from the prosecution perspective and obviously they wouldn't want it in because I felt it was a very powerful piece of evidence the actual video or animation was really nothing more than a moving diagram.
By today's standards the animation looks crew but at the time it was state of the art it was done it with a rather flat shaded algorithm for rendering is fairly unsophisticated the the human models were fairly disjointed it was defective showing placement of situations where people were how angles of your gentry were things like that but it wasn't terribly pretty.
Jim Mitchell's defense attorney argued that the animation was inaccurate since it included subjective elements that no one would possibly know.
The defense also challenged doctor Helene's acoustic cast arguing his conclusions were based on gunshot sound tasks that were not conducted at the crime scene.
Judge Richard line ultimately allowed the animation into evidence it was the first time forensic animation was used in a murder.
As the trial against Jim Mitchell drew near.
The prosecution struggle to understand the motive why did Jim Mitchell killed his brother.
And self proclaimed artist protectors of free speech and cultural icons the brothers were wealthy thanks to their multi million dollar pornography and strip club and pyre.
And the brothers had always been close even since child.
M. Li members admitted that RT's behavior had been a problem for some time.
On the day of his death.
RT called his mother and even she admitted that RT was in her words out of control.
Jim'S girlfriend Lisa Adams told police that already called her numerous times in the days before his death and the calls were threatening in nature.
The victim was argued was a very very severe alcoholic which it weighed on his brother that injected into this case the whole huge issue of heat of passion.
And if the killing is done in a heat of passion even though you intend to kill that will reduce it to a voluntary manslaughter.
Prosecutors believe the gym was no longer able to cope with his brother's behavior and your responsibility.
On the night of the murder.
Jim didn't knock on RT store check.
Dispatcher sherry Tucker took the call.
I'M in the bedroom and we hear.
Like the noise.
At the door.
You know it it is already.
Already had gone out to find out who was out there.
She was yelling at him while she's on the phone with me and we were getting no response after the first two shots RT the bedroom and headed down the hallway.
Third shot hit the door frame shots four in five both are.
In the abdomen then the shoulder.
At the shooting stopped here.
Medical experts believe RT would have survived.
Twenty eight seconds on the nine one one tape no shots were fired.
He was hit with the fatal shot.
The entire episode took less than a minute.
The defense argued that the beer bottle found near RT's body played a significant role in the case the defense argued that.
It is the the bottle appeared to be a gun.
And in one instance I believe the defense even suggested that arty Mitchell at one point in time had a gun when he came down the hall.
No gun was found near Hardee's body only the beer bottles.
In the end.
The jury found Jim Mitchell guilty of voluntary manslaughter.
Manslaughter is something that if it stands up on appeal is something that he can accept I mean it started out with the defense claiming it was an accident obviously the jury concluded it was not an accident.
Mitchell was sentenced to six years in prison after serving three years he was released for good behavior.
Police officers who worked on the case say the sentence was not nearly harsh enough.
For taking a life I think that was a very very mellow since.
He got away with murder and now he's back in business.
Yet without the crime scene reconstruction and animation.
There may not have been the conviction for manslaughter.
Without that we couldn't piece together in a way to show the actual sequence of events.
Once again coming back to that issue what was in the mind of the perpetrator.
The ones young man with a mischievous side.
RT is buried in the town of Lodi far from San Francisco and the eyes of curiosity seekers.
Jim Mitchell continues to run the Farrell theater according to the marquee it is still a venture of the Mitchell brothers but only in spirit.
