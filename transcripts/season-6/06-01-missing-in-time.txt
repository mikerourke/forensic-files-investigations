In nineteen ninety five Caroline Kennedy a Vancouver Washington got into a heated argument with her husband.
She then went to a local bar hello.
No one has seen or heard from her since.
But some saliva from an envelope and a speck of blood on the wrist watch help solve the mystery of her disappearance.
In nineteen ninety Caroline and Dan killer we were married for the second time.
Dan managed a furniture store Caroline was a medical technician employed by the U. S. military.
Caroline and Dan each had a daughter from their previous marriages and they moved into this home in Vancouver Washington.
My mom was basically the backbone of my whole family I mean she was very strong willed and she's just like she held everybody together she was problem solvers she was the supporters she was the happiness the joy she was just like everything you could ask for.
On Saturday night November eleventh nineteen ninety five Caroline and Dan got into an argument.
She didn't fight with her husband because her husband and decided instead of doing something with her that night that she carried on they were going to go out he was gonna go out with his brother and have some food and drink and she objected significantly to that and I don't know whether she stomped out of the house and go over there or how that transpired but she ended up in Omar's and she was doing some serious drinking there.
The waitress said Caroline was dancing but was there alone and was obviously intoxicated.
The other indication was that she was alone at the table and that her head was down and that she had her head on the table and was basically passed out at the table not functioning not talking to anyone very very clear to everyone in the bar that she was highly intoxicated.
That night around eleven o'clock witnesses said they saw Caroline leave the bar and she was never seen again I came on Sunday morning and she was gone the next day Dan Kennedy called police to report Caroline missing searcher family members friends and volunteers searched the surrounding area without success.
I knew that she would not leave.
In the somebody made her.
There was no way she would have left it with.
She is the really the light of the family her personality her kindness.
Caroline'S car was found in the bar's parking lot.
The Kennedy family hired their own search dogs the dogs tracked Caroline sand from the bar directly back to her home.
The police believed this might be evidence that Caroline returned home from the bar before she disappeared.
No one else was home that night Dan and the two girls spend Saturday night elsewhere.
Well they were concerned about.
Whether or not Dan's alibi that he was out drinking with his brother was solid and I think that's a state that relate.
And got real drunk.
And so the police were not a hundred percent convinced that.
In the case creating further suspicions was the fact that Caroline had a two hundred thirty thousand dollar life insurance policy payable to her husband I always sit behind and.
There is no doubt that he had I can never conceive the idea that he had actually done something like this.
Dan calibrate denied any involvement in his wife's disappearance but police discovered there were problems in the marriage.
We found out that it wasn't the perfect marriage by any stretch of imagination I think we figured that there were some difficulties and some strains in the marriage.
Two hours after Caroline left the bar the police received two calls from people who said they heard a woman screaming for help in a field about a mile from Omar's lounge.
Police searched the area using night vision goggles but they found nothing.
With no solid leads the killer the family offered a ten thousand dollar reward for any information on Caroline's whereabouts.
And then a bomb shell.
Customer at Omar's Lowndes said he saw Dan killer bee with Caroline in the parking lot on the night she disappeared.
When thirty four year old Caroline Killa B. didn't return home after spending a night drinking at a local bar her husband Dan was an immediate suspect.
Prosecutor David Seeley says there's an old saying in missing persons cases before you look at outlaws you have to look at the in laws one of the things they look out to begin with as a husband in a missing person case like this because I think a large percentage of their crimes are committed by family members.
Police found no evidence of foul play in the Khiladi home.
But in Caroline's bedroom they found some potent pain killers by captain.
My sister was having some problems with prescription drug medication and I confronted her and talked to her about that she had a big knowledge the problem and was working on that we were the whole family was being supportive of that.
My understanding of the mixture of alcohol and by can and is it makes you comatose and that's exactly what happened Caroline she was in the bar.
Witnesses at Omar's lounge say that Caroline passed out at our table.
One of the regular customers Dennis Smith helped her to her car.
What Smith told police was disturbing.
He said that he and Caroline left the bar and engaged in consensual sex in his truck.
As he walked her to her car a man approached them gets a Smith with a bad cold.
H. and forced her to leave with.
When shown a photographic lineup Smith identified Caroline's husband Dan as the culprit.
Dan Calabi angrily denied this he offered to take a lie detector test and passed.
Dan Calabi said he and his brother were out drinking together that night and the bar which the bartender there confirmed.
When police look closer into Dennis Smith's background they discovered that Smith had been convicted for the murder of his sister Patricia and Johnson in nineteen eighty two.
Smith served ten years of that sentence and had recently been released on parole.
And the witness told police that she saw mud on Smith's truck on the night Caroline disappeared.
He came to a shell station and Clark County his truck was all dirty he asked the intended there who's a friend.
Whether or not he could go to her parents house and wash his car.
The employee also thought she saw a blood smear on Smith's shirt.
With this new information Smith's truck was confiscated and police noticed that the inside of the truck had been wiped clean no fingerprints hairs or fibers even though Smith said Caroline had been in the truck for consensual sex.
Investigators did find a tiny speck of blood on the steering wheel.
And there was evidence of a recent fire Smith said a cigarette but accidentally ignited the upholstery and alert homicide investigators also confiscated Smith's wrist watch in the forensics lab scientists found a tiny speck of what appeared to be blood in the crevice of the wristband tests indicated it was human.
But whose was it.
Since we get half of our DNA from my mother and half from our father scientists could identify whether it was Caroline's blood in the truck by analyzing DNA samples from Caroline's parents but Caroline's mother delivered some shocking news despite raising Caroline as his own the man Carolyn Cole dad wasn't her biological father.
With help from Caroline during her upbringing.
Caroline'S biological father had died years earlier.
This made the blood stain analysis much more difficult.
We didn't have any solid DNA we didn't have a a piece of skin or S. blood sample from her from her body that we can compare to the blood stains so we are a little up in the air about what to do without a body scientist would have to improvise.
When Dennis Smith learned that he was a suspect in Caroline Kennedy's disappearance he flat and a nationwide manhunt was under way.
We didn't know who she is left with we had the thought that maybe she was in a hotel and angry.
And then we found out that she had been seen leaving with this guy Dennis and so we didn't know what that meant and then we found out that he was a murderer that'd been out on parole and so that took away some hope.
While the F. B. I.'s searched for Smith forensic scientists analyzed his truck.
Arson experts discovered hydrocarbons on the upholstery of Smith's truck.
Hydrocarbons are present when excelled around or flammable liquid is used to start a fire.
A little at the fire was intentionally set.
The damage was extensive and Smith's story didn't match the evidence.
We got a similar car see our we try to recreate the fired three or four different ways.
And each time we couldn't come up with that type of damage that we saw in this car in a small crack in the steering wheel of phenol failing test identified tiny stain as blind.
And on Dennis Smith's wristband scientists found another speck of blood.
But without Caroline's body scientists had no DNA sample for comparison.
So detectives searched for a sample of Caroline's DNA and they found it in Alaska.
Ten years earlier Caroline mailed a letter to a girl friend in Alaska and her friend had never thrown it away.
On the envelope flap and stamps Caroline saliva still a rich source of DNA even after ten years.
The samples were too badly degraded for traditional DNA testing so scientists used a newer and less exact DNA test called mitochondrial DNA.
Traditional DNA testing analyzes the nucleus of the cell but outside the cell nucleus are what are known as mitochondria cells that can be identified although not as precisely as in traditional DNA testing mitochondrial DNA is inherited from a mother to her children and therefore if you want to make a match between a sample of evidence from a missing person as as was in this case blood stains from someone whose body was not available you need only go to homes of maternal relative the DNA from the envelope flap and stamps matched the DNA from the blood found in Smith's truck and with DNA samples from Caroline Kennedy's mother and daughter Dr Milton concluded that the mitochondrial DNA and Dennis Smith struck was that of Caroline Khiladi.
It was a DNA profile that existed in only one out of two hundred thousand Caucasians because there was no body found in this case and I believe the remains of miss Colby are still missing it was very important to place her in the presence of Mr Smith and of course a blood stain on his watch band that comes back to her would be very powerful evidence.
On the one year anniversary of Caroline's disappearance friends and relatives gathered for a candlelight vigil outside of Omar's lounge the last place she was seen alive.
For over a year Dennis Smith had been on the run.
In the television series unsolved mysteries profile the case asking viewers for help in bringing Smith the justice.
Four days later an anonymous tip revealed Smith was living in Florida.
The trick now is to find.
And I turned to drugs and my step dad turned to alcohol.
And my sister turned away from all of us and my whole family just fell apart everything that I've known.
At first fifteen almost sixteen years.
In one night was all unraveled.
For fifteen months Caroline's family waited for some word on the search for Dennis Smith.
Law enforcement searched all over the country and an informant said Smith was living in Florida.
Police bear stopped the vehicle on the suspicion it was stolen.
The man driving the car.
Was Dennis Smith Smith tried to get away.
There was a fight and Smith was shot in the scuffle.
I was hoping he was in a lot of pain.
I wanted him to her.
I crossed my fingers though that he didn't die as much as I.
I hate him and do not want him in this world if you were to die there was really no hope of finding my mom's body or for him having to suffer in prison.
Smith survived the gunshot wound and returned to Washington state to stand trial for kidnapping rape and the murder of Carolyn Kellogg.
Even though police still hadn't found her body.
Smith pleaded not guilty.
And stood by his story that he was attacked by Caroline's husband in the parking lot of the bar and the Caroline left with her husband.
The defense reminded the jury that Smith identified Dan killer bee from a photographic lineup.
But prosecutors said Smith probably recognize Dan Kelly from television news reports about his wife's disappearance and it's just amaze me and I see other I mean on TV on court shows on anything real or not how the defense always tries to twist the victims into this horrible person when they never did anything to ask for what they got and they didn't deserve it.
Prosecutors believe the Caroline killer bee was inebriated and Omar's lounge and that Smith offered to drive her home.
Somewhere along the way Smith raped and murdered Caroline Kennedy in the cab of his truck.
blood spattered on to the steering wheel Smith's watch and probably on the upholstery.
Prosecutors suspected Smith buried Caroline's body somewhere near larch mountain.
A few hours later at a gas station attendant said she saw a blood stain on Smith's shirt and the destruct was full of mud.
Smith attempted to remove the blood inside his truck with detergents.
And when he couldn't remove it all from the upholstery he set it on fire.
But he missed a tiny speck of blood on his wrist band and a tiny speck of blood on the steering wheel.
Proof that Caroline killer bee had been bleeding inside his truck.
Some of his friends happen to be a nurses he went into great detail with his nurse friends about what is DNA how do you get rid of DNA I used pine sol and Lysol include other cleaning agents in my car is that gonna get rid of DNA.
Prosecutors also discovered that when Smith was in prison for killing his sister he told his cell mate how he would get away with murder at the next time.
Mr Smith told an inmate that if you've ever committed another murder he would dispose of the body by digging a hole placing the body in it re covering the whole in planting a tree on top of that so that no one would know that our bodies under there and wherever she is it's out of hand.
Most likely a dark cold place where we can go and visit her physically where her remains are he also told the inmate.
That he would dispose of the other evidence by burning.
The only scientific evidence in this case was the mitochondrial DNA taken from two tiny specks of blood.
Dennis Smith was found guilty of aggravated murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.
After his conviction Dennis Smith offered to disclose the location of Caroline's body in return for some Taco Bell burritos and ten thousand dollars in cash.
We obviously all know that he knows where the body is and now he's trying to get something for him when he should do the right thing and give up Caroline's body to to give closure to the family I think it's pathetic what he's trying to do now.
He'S not he's not getting any money he already has more things in prison that we have I mean he has free cable he has free paper view I mean I have to pay for my cable I have to go rent movies and then he wants extra spending money.
He just there's no way that I would give him a cent I wouldn't give them penny.
The killing the family may never recover Caroline's body for a proper burial.
Caroline'S daughter Gina not a day goes by when she doesn't think of her mother.
She has this beautiful new granddaughter.
That she never got the chance to meet NBA Graham and their two.
But that her grandmother and granddaughter will always know who she is.
And that she will always be a part of this family and that we never and miss her very very much.
