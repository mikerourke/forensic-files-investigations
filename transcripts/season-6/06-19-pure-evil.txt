On a sweltering Texas summer day in nineteen ninety three.
Workroom noticed something unusual off the side of the road.
Under a thicket of thorn bushes was the new decapitated.
Of the young girl.
Just two hundred feet away was another body a young white males.
Residents of this small town wondered who would brutally killed two young people in this way and what was the possible motive.
Cut off road a remote spot in Tellico Texas linked by a rickety wooden bridge over Smith creek.
This is the area where a road crew discovered the new body of an adolescent girls.
She had been shot St decapitated and her hands removed she also had extensive wounds on her abdomen thighs and genital area.
Under the bridge was another victim.
A young white male fully closed would been shot twice in the head with a twenty two caliber pistol on a barbed wire fence detectives found several long blonde hairs.
In the boys back pocket was a wallet with a library card.
And we thought that might be him but we weren't sure at this point because it was not a photo by the time it was just a card with the name on it.
The girls identification was more difficult since there were no hands for fingerprints and with the decapitation no opportunity for a dental comparison.
She looked like a young adolescent teenage white girl.
He also had amputations of both nipples.
And a number of other cuts mostly on the front of her body and she had some very long cuts down the front of the abdomen with extrusion evisceration of part of the intestines to the outside.
The rate test showed no signs of sexual assault.
On the side investigators visited the father of the boy James king.
Mr king also said that the girl's body might be his step daughter thirteen year old Christina Benjamin but wasn't sure because of the condition of the body.
Mr king told police that a few nights earlier.
Brian was sleeping outside in a hammock when a car sounded its horn out front.
The salt Brian talking to someone in a tan car then Brian dot in and left.
The next day the family discovered that Christina was missing two.
Investigators compared the hair on Christina's hair brush to several long blonde hair is found near the murder scene on the barbed wire fence.
One CM Tatian a barbed wire in the hairs from the strand they were found at the crime scene location were submitted to the laboratory I produce microscope slides and I compared those hairs to theirs from heritage.
And they were microscopically consistent with one another.
The family also provided police with an X. ray of Christina's recent foot injury.
That X. ray matched an X. ray of the girl's foot taken at the autopsy.
And I said mom I need some help.
I couldn't believe it.
That'S how we found out about it.
I can never imagine losing a child nobody in lessons happen to nobody else can either I can't imagine what my mom.
In the crime lab.
Charles Lynch found foreign blonde head hair on Brian Keane's pants which did not belong to either Brian or Christy.
Lynch also spotted a single fiber attached to Brian Snitker it was nearly invisible.
The fiber from the male victim she's using transmitted light microscopy I've seen those types of carpet fibers before usually from Japanese vehicles and this was a tan fiber so that was my communication to the police that it might be from a tan vehicle in Japanese my investigators hoped this single fiber would lead them to the automobile Brian king got into on his last night alive.
The grisly murder of two local teenagers with a highly publicized case in the small Texas community where the bodies were found.
The viciousness of the murders even shocked the pathologist in this case.
It'S the way the worst case of mutilation that I've seen.
in my work here.
As I have seen other cases of mutilation and seen a lot of cases of of what they call the crimes of passion over kill or someone stabbed or shot multiple times but this is the only case I've seen like this where someone had this much.
mutilation of the body probably after death.
Psychological profilers say that killers like this usually have aspirin drives and appetites the savage treatment of Christina was indicative of vengeance and extreme hatred and suggested that the killer knew the victim.
Local prosecutors went to the FBI behavioral science unit in Quantico Virginia to find out more about the mindset of this killer.
One of them said to me after he looked at the photographs.
He said and this is not a sexual crime.
And that was a little confused because obviously she was nude and never found her clothing.
And he said whoever performs whoever committed this crime did not have sex with her.
One trait common among individuals who have committed similar crimes is a history of abusing animals.
Neighbors told police that Brian and Christina were planning to go out with a boy named Jason on the night they disappeared.
And there was an anonymous telephone call to the sheriff's office the caller supposed to tell the dispatcher that we need to be looking at a subject by the name of Jason Massey.
Jason Massey was a twenty year old high school dropout the son of an alcoholic and drug user who spent his time moving from one run down tenement to another.
Jason was a petty criminal with a history of stalking harassment theft and most surprisingly a history of abuse to animals.
A couple days before the discovery of the bodies it is police had received a call.
There was a figure him ran from the scene who was later identified as Jason Eric mast.
Massey'S friends painted a bizarre portrait of the troubled young man.
This guy also told me about how Jason Massey lied to mutilate animals such as dogs cats castles.
And police discovered evidence that Massey knew Brian and Christina casually Jason Massey made comments about Christina about how he will live there and he will take a while everything seemed to point to Massey there was very little forensic evidence found at the crime scene no smoking gun so to speak the case had to be developed we had the we had two children the bodies were horrific the way they were found particularly the girl much work needed to be done to develop it the great difficulty in the case all along with what happened how did this boy get killed the girl detail what was the sequence what Tom was she sexually assaulted what was the motive why was it done.
And that was completely missing from the crime scene.
Police brought Jason Massey and for questioning.
That'S what I want to see something.
And after down some photos.
Of the crime scenes which show Christina Benjamin and Brian king.
And he looked down and he looked at me and.
The next thing I know he's he's kind of been the no worries.
Gaggan real real real big time you know and I knew I had a soft spot in you know when you did that and I will forget that the expression of il.
Despite the circumstantial evidence against Jason Massey there was no proof for that investigators needed scientific evidence.
The search warrants police collected samples of Jason Massey is here and also impounded his Subaru automobiles.
A piece of the tan carpet was removed for scientific analysis.
Also inside with three stains on the seat which tested positive for blind.
When we got into the trunk of Jason as his car there was a single leaf with a blood stain on a roll of duct tape the parent but on it and also hammered it appeared to have blood on it.
There was no sign of the twenty two caliber weapon used in the murders.
However police did find a cash register receipt for some twenty two caliber ammunition as well as a set of handcuffs and a hunting knife.
Investigators received another phone.
This one saying that Masih was seen washing his car inside and out at a local car wash.
East immediately search the contents of the vacuum machine at that car wash inside they found an appointment card from Massey's probation officer and a number of long blonde hairs.
Hey there's from the vehicle Jason messing and head hairs found at the car wash location world microscopically similar to those Christina Benjamin.
The blood found in masses car was tested for DNA but it couldn't be compared to the bodies since they were too badly degraded for DNA analysis.
By analyzing the DNA profile of Brian and Christine as biological parents and comparing it to the DNA profile of the blood in Massey's car scientists could see if there were similar genetic markers we were able to determine that that yes much more certainly that blood did come from Christina Benjamin.
Scientists also needed to know if the time of the deaths match the time frame Jason Massey and his automobile were in the victim's neighborhood.
Best evidence was like forensic entomologist.
That looking at the the larva activity found on the bodies could come up with a pretty good idea of when they were were killed in relation to each other and in relation to time in general.
Samples of the insect larvae from both bodies were sent to the prominent forensic entomologist Dr Neil Haskell.
Haskell studied the larvae and attempted to cultivate live larvae from the same heat and humidity conditions that existed in Texas the week the bodies were found.
By doing this Dr Haskell could approximate the time between when the flies lay their eggs on the bodies and the larvae develop to the stage in which they were found.
Dr Haskell determined that Christina and Brian died two days before their bodies were discovered.
This coincided with the time frame that the ten automobile similar to Massey's was in front of Brian and Christine is home.
Jason Massey was arrested and charged with capital murder.
We did not guilty Jason Massey was a handsome young man and I was worried that if he took the stand and testified that he might sway some of the jurors guilt or innocence would be determined by the forensic evidence.
No one of those sciences was able to show beyond a reasonable doubt that Messick committed the crime that put all together.
It meant that either Masih had committed the crime rate had to be the most unlucky person in the history of the world because every piece of evidence pointed toward him.
Before the trial ended prosecutors learned even more about Jason Massey.
Information that was sealed his fate.
In nineteen ninety four Jason Massey went on trial in Texas for the murders of fourteen year old Brian king and thirteen year old Christina Benjamin.
Prosecutors believe that both Brian and Christina got into Jason masses car around midnight on July twenty seventh for a ride in the country.
Prosecutors also believe Massey's plans included much more than just a ride.
Masih stopped his car on the cut off road bridge and shot Brian king points in my head point blank range with the twenty two caliber pistol he then pushed him out of the car off the side of the bridge.
Christina got out of the car and ran Jason followed her in the back of the wound wasn't fatal later he shot her in the head.
Prosecutors believe the mutilation occurred after death.
Christina'S head and hands I've never been recovered.
The motive was difficult for prosecutors to identify there was no traditional motive in this case and instead Masih was most likely what's referred to as a loss murder.
That is a person that receives a certain degree of sexual gratification from the killing and mutilation of human beings.
Before the trial was over.
The hunter walking in the woods made a gruesome discovery.
He found a red cooler inside with the decapitated heads of thirty one animals and also the journals of Jason Massey revealing his hideous deeds and horrific thoughts.
Frightening and incriminating insight into the mind of the killer a mind obsessed with murder sex mutilation of young girls.
The jury found Jason Eric Massey guilty to mergers.
Two young lives were in bands.
Comment on you guilty conviction.
No ma'am I'm just glad.
For the penalty phase prosecutors had just twenty four hours to assemble the information contained in Jason Massey's journals to convince the court that the death penalty was appropriate.
You start out with killing eight cals thirty dogs and thirty nine cats.
Cut off their heads and captains trophies here's one re talking about a little girl and he says that he has he loves he's decided to killer he just doesn't know when.
Prosecutors told the jury that Jason Massey's journal contained evidence that he had planned to kill again and again.
Massey'S writings revealed that his greatest aspiration in life was to become the most famous serial killer in America we wanted the jury to know just the kind of person that we were dealing with.
And that person was one that was some obviously going to be a predator of incredible proportions.
The jury deliberated just fifteen minutes and decided upon the death penalty.
Well the judge said I sentence you to death by lethal injection and the only injustice in this court today will be that that was at your desk will be so much more humane than that of your victims the judge said that.
And everybody stood up and cheered.
Jason Massey was executed on April third two thousand one.
Christina'S grandparents witnessed his last moments alive.
He said yes first I would like to speak to the victim's family first of all I would like to say that I do not know that.
Any of you all and that's unfortunate because I'd like to apologize to each and everyone of you individually.
I can't imagine what I've taken from you all but I do want to apologize to you for what I did I want you to know that I am.
It was only I who committed the murders no one else was involved Chris it's Christina felt no pain.
The things done to her occurred after her death I swear this thing started to occur occurred after her death is where her head and hands I threw into the Trinity River I didn't rape ordered torture her either.
I admit my guilt and I ask your forgiveness I pray you will forgive me.
If not now then in the future may god be with you and keep you through this his servant stationary.
I don't know how to describe it other than we watched him die we had no emotions other that we were we were watching this person died he kept melting I'm sorry I'm sorry we didn't believe it no there's no way that you could forgive this man for what he did.
It was quick it was painless he was lucky.
The way I look at it my brother my sister weren't so lucky.
They died horrible deaths.
I'M not the one that was going to have to judge.
Detectives very good and efficient the jobs well.
