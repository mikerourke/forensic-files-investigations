Breathtaking beaches and beautiful bodies explain why southern California is often the first choice for motion picture and still photographers.
In nineteen ninety five Linda Sobek a busy model with a growing reputation vanished on her way to a photo shoot.
Linda'S photographic images to launch her career and would also solve the mystery of her disappearance.
For most of beach California is just fifteen miles south of downtown Los Angeles.
The sun surf and sand track the young and beautiful.
Linda Sobek twenty seven year old blonde model and actress live right off the boardwalk.
She was a cheerleader for the Los Angeles raiders football team and was a popular kini lingerie and calendar model she also aspired to be an actress.
Three hundred and three pounds in twenty four inch waist she was too short and athletic for high fashion work.
What are good looks and well toned body brought many assignments.
On Thursday morning November sixteenth nineteen ninety five Linda was paged for a last minute photo shoot.
Linda grab some clothes left a message with her mother that she call later and headed off.
She was never seen or heard from again.
Hey don't worry you know Linda's got things to do she's out working two parties took off and was doing some imam kept saying no no I know something else is wrong.
Later that day Linda had an audition for the married with children television series but she failed to show up.
Anyone that knew Linda knew there's no way she would ever have missed that interview that addition and that really was a signal to her parents to start an intensive search the family had been distributing.
Numerous fires and like fifty three thousand flyers with a twenty thousand dollar reward.
I had whenever address books and I just started making phone calls to all the girls.
Erin please Linda had broken some of her own rules about modeling assignments no one knew where she was or the name of the photographer since he took this assignment outside of her modeling agency they had no information either.
Two days later in a trash bin a worker in the Angeles National Forest found some pictures of a beautiful woman.
It took them home because they were so well done.
He went home had the pictures in his in his backpack and he forgot about it until Monday night he was watching television and he saw the TV coverage of the soul back investigation.
When the man realized the photos were of the model reported missing he immediately called police.
Two years earlier just a short distance away the skeletal remains of another long.
Like Linda Kim had been called at the last minute for a modeling assignment with an unknown photographer.
A murder was never solved.
But the thought that Linda was somewhere in the Angeles National Forest was daunting.
It'S an area approximately a thousand square miles about the size of the state of Rhode Island.
As the days passed.
Investigators suspected foul play.
A few days after Linda Sobek disappearance Charles Rathmann commercial freelance photographer called police with some information.
He said he was with Linda at a Denny's restaurant on the morning of her disappearance.
He said they discussed her portfolio and after the meeting and said the two went their separate ways.
Linda'S car was found in the parking lot of the restaurant.
Tests on the vehicle found no evidence of foul play.
But police were starting to get suspicious.
Among the items found in the trash bin and Angeles National Forest along with Linda's photographs and date book was a rental agreement for a Lexus sports utility vehicle.
The name on the document was Charles respite.
Residents said the rental agreement probably gotten mixed up with Linda's portfolio during their meeting.
Rasping shot photographs of the Lexus later that day for auto week magazine and you return the car the next day.
Even though the Lexus had been washed thoroughly inside and out police found a number of clues.
In the backseat was a suspicious red stain.
Fifteen all failing test revealed the stain was blocked further tests showed it was human blood.
In the cargo area was a car cover which tested positive not only for blood but traces of human saliva.
With no other leads investigators wanted to know if the Lexus had been in the Angeles National Forest where Linda's photographs were discovered.
Basically we put vaseline on a tire rolling across poster board and then use magnetic fingerprint powder to enhance that tire track that's on the poster board.
And it essentially makes a a tire prints on this board that's indicative of the tire tread that might have been left back at a particular scene.
Finding higher impression in a forest covering over a thousand square miles wouldn't be easy.
Not surprisingly Charles Rathmann was interrogated again and this time he changed his story.
Rathmann now said he hired demanded to model for him in the photo shoot with the Lexus sports utility vehicle.
Residents so back drove to el Mirage dry lake bed about two hours north of Hermosa beach.
Linda'S assignment was to drive the vehicle in tight circles while Rathmann took photographs.
Treffen demonstrated the maneuver while then just stood by and watched.
Rasband said he lost control of the vehicle and accidentally hit Linda killing her.
According to wrap he panicked put Linda's body in the vehicle drove to a deserted location in the Angeles National Forest and buried the body somewhere there.
He was very vague he kept saying I can't remember he would break into tears and say I'm not sure I'm I'm not sure I don't know where she is exactly but I can take you there the Lexus showed no signs of exterior damage consistent with an accident.
But the search was unsuccessful.
He'S leaning on a wild goose chase he knew exactly where she was and I was trying to stall to buy more time hoping that Linda's body would be decomposed by the time we did find it.
Investigators pushed rafting yet again for information this time touring the forest in a helicopter.
After a number of failed attempts.
Aspen finally led them to Linda's body.
The left tire impression of the Lexus was found in the soft sand nearby she surprisingly was perfectly preserved for ninety beryl I was I was not optimistic that we would have a lot of soft tissue left so diagnose exactly what happened and I was I was surprised.
A forensic archaeologist was brought in to retain anything that that the denture Rifat.
The autopsy would reveal the true cause of death whether it was an accident or homicide.
Linda so backs autopsy revealed an enormous amount of information about her death.
Except for blood above her right ear her body showed no external signs of an automobile injury.
Her blood alcohol level was point one three well above the state limit for intoxication.
She died not from an automobile accident as Charles Rathmann claimed bias fixie ation.
She struggled against static because to hemorrhaging alongs as well as all in the neck in the eyes which is typical for somebody who's paying is fixated against their will so she was aware awake struggling for her life at that time this fixation is the most common mechanism used in homicidal sexual assaults.
There were other injuries.
Rosi'S a twisted wrist and ligature marks on her ankles.
That show that our legs have been forcibly spread apart and and held in that position she struggled against those restraints because there were abrasions up and down her legs indicating a struggle in the body appeared to have been washed.
She was not wearing makeup.
And it appeared that her clothing had been changed before.
I call this a girl thing but I was very troubled with the position of her clothing the position her supper was such that it was all the way up to her neck and this concern me because I don't think that's a natural position most women wear closing sort of enough in the mid chest region and this was an unnatural position.
There was also evidence of forcible sodomy.
Look into Charles Rathmann is past revealed a man with the mercurial personality which it cost him a number of freelance projects he could be very personal and charming.
He could lose his temper and.
Almost go ballistic throw things around a a photo shoot he could talk to models and be very personable and polite to them and then go behind the camera and say very derogatory things about them.
A few years earlier in Columbus Ohio Charles Rathmann was arrested and charged with the rape of a married co worker restaurant claimed the encounter was consensual and he was acquitted.
The search of Rathbones home revealed a collection of over two hundred guns.
Of particular interest was a forty five caliber semi automatic pistol the gun was examined for the presence of blood due to the.
the hypothesis that the sexual assault expert had that is was used in the sexual assault of the victim.
In doing so you initially examined the weapon with just regular.
Room lighting and no blood was observed but when I tested the gun chemically or used presumptive blood tests and examination the gun I did detect a up a positive presumptive test for blood on the breech face surface of that weapon well we had we found a lot of evidence from his house and from talking to his friends that he did have a dislike for blinds and that he did have.
A dislike for some women in particular that it referred to Linda is a little bitch and being difficult to work with Charles Rathmann was arrested and charged with first degree murder and sodomy with a foreign object.
He said Linda was drinking that day and after striking her accidentally with the Lexus she began kicking and screaming while trying to subdue Linda.
Accidentally suffocated her.
Almost ludicrous to think that she would drink while on a photo shoot.
Especially when you think that she had an interview with a television program scheduled for later that evening the queue would compromise herself.
He claimed his sexual encounter with Linda that day wasn't forced at all that it was consensual.
And he claimed to have photographs to prove.
Charles Rathmann claimed that Linda Sobek willingly engaged in sex with him before the automobile accident taken photographs of Linda that day which would prove.
The defendant told his brother that there were some photographs in the desert that would prove his innocence improve that Linda consented to a sexual relations with him drew him a map of where to find these rolls of film and that the defendant's brother Robert Rothman and his girlfriend drove out up into the mountains and were able to find these five rolls of film in the middle of the desert after months of exposure to the sun and the wind and the rain.
Robert Preston found five rolls of film.
But instead of turning them over to police he developed the film himself for rules contained G. rated pictures of Linda posing at el Mirage two different outfits.
In some of the pictures.
There was a hole in her five high stockings raising questions about whether Linda posed willingly.
The fifth role was water damaged double exposed.
The fifth row phone was a series of double expose pictures twelve images on the dashboard of the vehicle and eleven images which were fairly X. rated and pornographic of female genitalia you could see no head no face really nobody just hands on a couple shots and primarily a close up of a female genitalia.
The mystery of this visit was clouded by the water damage so we only seen bits and pieces of these various frames are various photographs according to the defense those pictures indicated that Linda Sobek had engaged in consensual sexual behavior with the defendant on the day that they took the pictures of the vehicle and the day she disappeared and died.
With the help of the sheriff's photo lab and an aerospace company the pictures were enhanced.
The aerospace corporation scanned these images down and assisted me for three days going over pixel by pixel the significance of what we were saying in the background you could see some of the elements of the automobiles dashboard.
On the steering wheel was not that of the Lexus.
It was an old mobile prototype racks and photographed on a previous project.
The steering wheel on the question vehicle has an entirely different logo than Lexus it has cruise controls that are in the steering wheel the Lexus vehicle does not have.
Investigators compared the body of the woman in the photographs the pictures taken during Linda's autopsy was clear that this was not one to settle back and in no way would did it show any type of consensual act the dress was wrong the car stickers around the hands that you see within the pictures I have a very masculine appearance and don't appear to be consistent with our victim.
In the list goes on and on and prosecutors did not believe RAF Simons accidents on area.
They suspected that when Rathmann was taking photographs that day for Linda it was a job.
The forensic evidence suggested the president struck on the right side of the head twisted Linda's arms tied her ankles and sexually assaulted her possibly with these guys.
You may have forced her to consume the alcohol's.
The deep bruises on her ankles indicated Linda desperately tried to escape.
After the assault rest because.
Linda'S blood and saliva were found on the car covering the cargo area.
He later disposed of lenders personal items in a dumpster.
It made the mistake of including the Lexus rental agreement in his name.
Charles Rathmann was convicted of first degree murder and sodomy and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
I think Mr aspen has not emotionally matured past probably the age of eighteen or nineteen years old was able not able to handle rejection by women and acted out for those poor feelings in very inappropriate ways ranging from inappropriate comments to sexual advances to touching this to actual rapes and finally culminating in Linda's murder the forensic evidence in this case I think was all important those photographs that he introduced it to save him and and provide his defense were in fact.
What caused his conviction.
The Sobek family believes that Robert Kraft and should have been charged with evidence tampering for his role in the discovery of the film.
Robert RAF been admitted on the stand that he had destroyed the map that his brother had drawn and that had led him to these canisters of film.
Of its own accord he's admitted to his own guilt.
Prosecutors suspect that Charles Rathmann also may have been involved in Kimberly pen daily doses death.
Kim met an unidentified photographer at a Denny's restaurant on the day she disappeared.
And her remains were discovered just a few miles from Linda so.
To date no one has been charged with Kim Penn daily says merger.
