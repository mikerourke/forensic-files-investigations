The key to becoming a good cattle man is buying the right capital at the right price.
In the nineteen eighties one cattle man in the story had a unique talent for choosing the very best cattle and pay very little for.
Some of his farm hands however paid a steep price.
In Chillicothe Missouri the local barber shop is still the place to hear news and swap stories and even pick a few to.
It is also the place where farmers still make a living raising cattle and selling them at auction.
In the late nineteen eighties cattle auction houses throughout the state were being swindled.
Buyers were mostly drifters and transients would show up make their purchase pay by check and then disappear.
The checks were inevitably worthless.
It was that several of them would have Jackson and when we went to look for we couldn't find.
With an arm into the computer but they never showed up.
Many of the buyers had at some point worked on this farm in Morris town just outside of Chillicothe.
The farm was owned by seventy eight year old rate Copeland and his wife.
Say a prayer to be just a elderly farm couple Lipper kind of shy and and didn't mix much with the people but never know them you know causing any problem here.
The small farm wasn't enough to support the Copeland's Faye also worked in a factory and later as a motel made.
But it was a hard life and the family was poor.
When the Copeland children left the farm to pursue their own dreams ray looked for farm hands to help work the farm he was up in age hard of hearing and wasn't a great businessman.
Because right could not read or write and with bookkeeping writing names down where they were at things like this I mean he needed somebody to write it down.
To find workers rate would go to local homeless missions.
And they go out you know get people and help get it out hi cal started.
These men were usually on the run themselves.
Many had addictions family problems or suffered from mental illness.
Most had been arrested for vagrancy petty theft or similar offenses.
Ray Copeland paid them fifty dollars a day for their labor and also provided room and board.
One of these men whose offer that kind of money and a place to live especially maybe in a country setting why it would just be it would be paradise it would be something that would be a dream come true for a man like that.
One of the men wanted in connection with the writing bad checks to cattle auction houses was twenty seven year old Dennis Murphy a drifter from Illinois who for a time had worked for ray Copeland.
In nineteen eighty six a sheriff's deputy asked ray Copeland Murphy's whereabouts Copeland said Murphy simply took off one day.
I would leave in the middle of the night he N. or they went to see her again he said you know how transits are they're here today and gone tomorrow and they would just leave.
In a desperate when Copeland was told Murphy was a thief he wasn't surprised because he had been swindled two no I don't we're looking for some bad checks I don't want to be a solution that he R. Copeland also had a check from Murphy which should bounce because of insufficient funds.
In addition to Murphy seven other men were wanted in connection with the cattle auction check scam none could be located.
Until police received a call from Nebraska.
The informant said he knew where Murphy and the other transients had gone.
There were eight man wanted for writing bad checks to cattle auction houses in central Missouri.
All has disappeared from the area without a trace.
When police got a telephone call from Jack McCormick a drifter and small time con man would one time had worked on ray Copeland's farm.
It was a transit in India moved a lot he had a lot of stories and I think he liked a lot of stories.
McCormick said he thought he saw some human bones including a skull on the Copeland far.
The farm covered forty acres including a pond a barn fields and woods county deputies Chillicothe police the state highway patrol and the county coroner all search the area.
Surveying the property looking for possible burial sites on the property and possible places were the deaths actually took place we had search dogs.
After nine days of searching without success they brought Jack McCormick to the scene.
I asking the subject just point to where these bodies are where this scope and leg bone was.
And he got outside there kind of the side bar looking off down through the pasture poly symbol really he said I didn't see it they said it could have probably been a day span or something down there.
Looking to call plans background showed an interesting coincidence.
Twenty years earlier he had been arrested numerous times for the same thing writing bad checks.
Ray appeared to have settled down because there had been no arrests in the twenty years since.
And he had never been arrested for any violent crime.
Police soon learned that Copeland worked on some other farms in the area to earn extra money.
One was a farm just a few miles away.
In the barn work Copeland work storing bales of hay police discovered a shallow grave and the badly decomposed bodies of three men lined up to tell.
They had probably been there for two or three years and were unrecognizable.
They were just wrapped in blankets and and and cursing grave is what they were in this situation they were in and some clay ground which tends to Canada ward off decomposition because the air and doesn't get to it as quickly as it was in Sam a different type of solo.
The three men have been killed by a gunshot wound to the head.
There was no evidence linking ray Copeland or anyone else to the crime.
A few days later in another nearby barn on the same property police removed hundreds of bales of hay and under a floorboard was another body.
Six weeks later in a nearby well was yet another money.
The man was wearing a belt which said.
But was this Dennis Murphy.
And was the killer ray Copeland.
Why would he do something like that twenty eight we had everything paid for we didn't open it.
The bodies of five men had been recovered from the farm in the story.
Jack McCormick a former employee of rate Copeland's farm told police that Copeland was running a check fraud scam.
He said Copeland gave him a few hundred dollars to open a checking account and told him to use a post office box as his address.
Copeland then took McCormick the cattle auctions and sat in the stands signaling McCormick win to bid on cattle.
When he won the bidding.
And sometimes the check would clear and then they would kind of have a standing at the sale barn and go back next time and ride a larger check with the pretence that he would like to check good and but the check dam when it got to the bank it's clear.
And Jack said when he got there he said he was already kind of scared of right but when he got down there he said he wouldn't take his eyes off ray kept looking up by adding those ray had the twenty two rifle and supposedly was going to shoot.
Hello I get a good shot.
Jack said he looked up real fast and then when you look back ray had the rifle pointed at.
McCormick said he talked Copeland out of shooting him he promised Copeland he would leave the area and never come back.
Fled Missouri and for five months kept quiet because he feared Copeland would kill him if he ever told anybody about this.
When investigators searched the Copeland's home they discovered an old twenty two caliber rifle.
And a full assortment of men's clothing.
None of which belonged to ray Copeland.
Close from several different people but different sizes shoes.
And hidden in a camera case was a list of man hired by a recall plan to work on the farm.
Four of the names were marked with an X. which corresponded to the four were wanted in connection with passing bad checks.
Investigators sent the skulls of the victims to Dr Ronald forensic odontology.
Formed a dental examination and took xrays and created a transparent dental chart for each body.
So you make a chart of everything you find in the pre mortem records to match to the post mortem records.
In this case the pre mortem records posed a challenge.
and these people had not had dental treatment in the period of time from the time the records are made up to the time of their death.
Some of the transients records for almost thirty years old and the skulls were missing many teeth which complicated the comparison and then it got down to point I think it's someone we have to look at the bone patterns member one of them had a con dial the joint the job right up here that the condo was misshapen.
That match the panoramic dental X. ray belonging to Dennis Murphy positively identifying the body found in the well.
By comparing pre and post mortem dental charts Dr Guyer identified the other four bodies as wave one.
Our party and Freeman were three of the four names on the Copeland list marked with an X..
Governor Scott Lindley performed autopsies on all of the bodies and discovered that the cause of death in each case was a gunshot wound to the head from a small caliber gun shot at close range if it's a close range that inside layer the school tends to break away or flake away and there's more cracking and damage to the school.
And inside the skulls Lynn later found bullets and bullet fragments.
Ballistics tests revealed that the lands and grooves on those fragments matched the lands and grooves from ray Copeland's twenty two caliber rifles.
Police arrested ray Copeland as well as the person they believed was his partner in crime.
What surprised me more anything else was them actually Reston mom for the same time.
What role did sixty eight year old fake Copeland play in the mergers.
Great Copeland was arrested and charged with the murder of five man in what was believed to be a modern day cattle rustling schemes.
I knew nothing about it.
They didn't include me.
While in prison they wrote a letter to her husband assuring him that things would cool down soon.
Feis hand writing matched the handwriting on the list of the missing man.
They denied any knowledge of the mergers.
Long history of violence had previously been hidden from everyone but the Copeland family.
Thirty one time a one of my brothers is scraping the bottom of those boldly but I don't mail he didn't like the sound took a frying pan to.
Fabyan Drake Copeland each tried separately.
These trials with the biggest news to ever hit Livingston county Missouri.
Prosecutors believe that rape Copeland hired the workers at the homeless mission is set up each one with the post office box and the checking account and took them to the local cattle auction.
Before the checks could bounce prosecutors say rate Copeland would sell the cattle and kill the worker and buried the body.
They were lower than anybody else they could he could care less about it they were on government payroll they didn't need to be there they didn't he may need to be alive he had said that a lot to talk about transients.
Ray was convicted of five counts of murder and sentenced to death.
For what he'd done to the the transits and the people all through his life and he he deserved sends.
Thank Copeland denied any involvement in the murders saying she was an abused wife who only did what she was told.
I think she had some ideal for the candles cam going on as far as the killings I don't know I don't think so I hope to god she didn't know.
The list of workers in fake Copeland's handwriting helps sealed the case against.
Faye Copeland was also convicted of murder and was sentenced to death.
That is the only thing I think they convict our own was a piece of paper with the names.
He died in prison in nineteen ninety three.
In nineteen ninety nine after ten years on death row Faye Copeland sentence was commuted to life in prison.
Radium Faye Copeland don't get much sympathy from the transients who live in the missions on commercial street.
I don't have any feelings for people like that at all.
The eight man on the Copeland's list Thomas park Franklin Hudson and Dale break are still missing.
Police believe they too were murdered and that their bodies are buried nearby.
