Murder mystery dinner shows are often a fun way for amateur sleuths test their crime busting skills while enjoying a meal with friends.
This is the story of a man killed just hours after leaving the theater.
Despite some good acting.
Taylor was no match for the skills of real life forensic scientist.
St Michael's a small waterfront community on the Maryland shore.
Spectacular views of the miles river and Chesapeake Bay provide a relaxing escape from the hectic pace of daily life.
On Valentine's day in nineteen ninety eight a local resort offers couples the opportunity for a romantic getaway weekend chance to unwind relax play some golf.
Tennis and enjoy one another.
The weekend also included an audience participation event a murder mystery dinner theater production.
The first hour is generally a cocktail hour and the actors are unloading during this whole hour and that had the audience can very readily see who is who is the bad guy who hates to reply in the audience that night were Stephen Kim Rico from laurel Maryland.
Steve was a golf course grounds superintendent.
Ironically the recalls were seated next to a real life prosecutor and his date of probation officer.
Can and her husband Steve we're sitting there and she jumped right off of the high my name's Kim and this is Steve house like us is gonna be a good table set up yeah she's friendly person she was very active in terms of trying to figure out what was going on to play talking to various of the actors trying to get insights into who might be about to commit the murder that was gonna happen in the play and later on who did.
These productions use audience involvement to help solve the crime.
My murders are.
Usually not premeditated but something happens during the evening that just kind of pushes the person over the edge.
If the audience is a really.
Watching at that particular moment they're gonna they're gonna catch it because it's almost like hold light bulb moment.
By all accounts the evening was a success.
Afterwards Steve Rico went back to the hotel room and Kim left the resort briefly to run an errand.
When she returned at one thirty in the morning.
She saw flames coming from the room.
Firefighters thirty five year old Steve we call from the floor of the hotel room he was in his pajamas.
They were empty beer bottles and some cigars found in the hotel room.
It appeared that Steve was drinking reading of playboy magazine and smoking a cigar when he fell asleep with the cigar possibly starting the fire.
I remembered just coming back from a walk with my family and getting a phone call from my sister and physically collapsing to the ground so it was very tough and but it was an accident still it was just hard there's too many questions that were unanswered and it just it really was a shock.
This was viewed as a I was a routine but it was viewed as a routine smokers accent that the smoker fell asleep.
At at at at a fire started in the smoker died and that's kind of how the police took it in and then understood it to be in addition to his wife Steve recalled left behind an eight year old daughter and.
Is a great man cared a lot about his family the most important things in his life for his daughter his wife means job.
Fire investigators noticed a melted plastic soda bottle on the table next to Steve Bannon.
Investigators call this a point because it usually points in the direction of the fire.
But other clues in the room would point to an entirely different direction.
News of Steve Rico's death shocked friends and coworkers who recalled how much Steve was looking forward to the weekend get away with his wife.
Sometimes it's hard to get past thinking right now it's just his last moments but I tried to get bass and a lot of time specially when my family gets together we think of a good time still and I remember just ten like I said he was my Big Brother I mean I remember dancing with him at my wedding and.
Excuse me I'm always telling me that he'd always be there for me and now there's been a lot of times I needed him so it's been tough and I'm for everything we've been through it's just I know there's no bringing him back but so fast it's hard.
The news also surprise those who sat for the recalls at the dinner.
I can recall he said what was the name of that guy that was sitting at the table with us and that was Steve so that was the guy that got killed in this fire like a god.
Deputy fire marshal Michael Mulligan was assigned to investigate the fire.
The physical fire damage to the hotel room was minimal it was so well insulated but the fire didn't have enough oxygen to spread.
One cigar was missing from a new pack near the bad it appeared that the fire started on the bedroom floor where Steve was lounging at the time of the fire.
We eliminated a possible electric.
Source of ignition.
The the heating and air conditioning units were eliminated a lightning and and.
There was nothing else at the point of origin.
With the most common causes of the fire eliminated it looked as if a lit cigar might have been the cause but investigators could find no evidence of the cigar box or passions.
Dr David Fowler the deputy chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland immediately performed the autopsy.
Blood test revealed that Steve had a normal concentration of carbon monoxide in the system extremely unusual for someone who died while breathing the carbon monoxide produced by a fire.
The next step was to examine his airway passages for signs of smoke inhalation.
You have this layer of mucus which lines inside of you a way to track foreign particles of which which is one and it gets stuck on to that and it stays and we can find it very easily at the time of the autopsy.
I found absolutely no sort.
Well now I have two tests which are both telling me exactly the same thing that she was not breathing at the time of the fire.
To see if it was possible for a lit cigar to start a hotel fire investigators conducted an experiment we got a pillow and pillowcase and we did our own burn test one out and got a hold of some backwoods cigars.
With the cigars and placed them on the pillowcase and then directly on the pillow may decrease in the pillow and we did this repeatedly.
Hotels usually use bed coverings treated with flame retardant chemicals in order to prevent this very scenario.
At no point could we get the the pillow the pillow case where the bedspread to burn.
Another contradiction Steve was not known to be a smoker.
Even smoke in smoke at all in fact at one time during a golf banquet a sales meeting he was offered some very fine cigars by one of the salesmen were selling some some equipment for long Kerr and he refused and told his friend I I don't know why people even smoke those things but it's Steve Rico was dead when the fire started.
What killed him.
As investigators continue their look into the mysterious hotel fire that killed Steve recall XLON sniffing dogs identified a flammable liquid on the bedroom floor at the foot of the bed.
But chemical tests on the debris from the hotel room could not identify the itself.
Therefore the findings of the excellent sniffing dogs would not be admissible in court.
None the less the fire marshal ruled the fire arson.
They were empty beer bottles in the hotel room and Kim said Steve was drinking heavily at dinner.
The autopsy found no alcohol in his system.
Background check revealed Steve had over four hundred thousand dollars worth of life insurance with his wife Kim as the beneficiary.
Interestingly Kim purchased an additional two hundred fifty thousand dollar policy on Steve's life shortly before he died.
Detectives also learned that Kim Rico was having a sexual affair with the man ten years younger and discovered love letters in Kim's personal papers to prove it.
Kim Rico denied she was involved in her husband's death but admitted the couple was having marital problems.
Kim said they went to the resort to work on their marriage.
But after the dinner theater performance the two argued over sex.
Her story was that he wanted to have sex with her that night and she had turned him down they had an argument and she left the scene because.
His frustration and his disappointment with her and Steve stayed behind according to Kim he was drinking waiting a playboy magazine and smoking a cigar but investigators discovered evidence that Kim was seeking to end their eight year old marriage not fix it.
Kim was an extrovert Steve a homebody and Kim told friends and relatives the two were incompatible.
She kind of played games with him at the end because she told him she was not happy and she I think she told us that she was considering divorce and then she said that he's got to work on himself he's got to make improvements he's got a do a bunch of things and he did start doing all those things because he did want to save the marriage and he admitted okay I need to spend more time with my family I need it you know if that's what you know I do love them and he started working on all those things.
And then she killed a.
Kimberly'S co worker informed us that Kimberly had come to him she believes what he believed in a joking manner that can really wanted this co worker to kill Steve.
Co worker thought that she was joking felt that they had just been having normal Meryl problem so the co worker.
Told Kimberly you know just laughed and said all just want to just put in the sleep.
In order to sleep forever.
It may have been an unfortunate joke.
Sectional choline as a drug Kimberly recall would have had access to as a medical technician.
It'S used to relax the muscles before placing an intubation tube down a patient's throat.
In large doses it is lethal.
Succinylcholine is broken down by human enzymes almost immediately and is therefore untraceable.
Kimberly being a medical technician assisted in surgery and we we knew that and we learned that sexual Colin is on the court there but it's not accounted for S. marcada drugs required to be accounted for Steve's autopsy found no traces of succinylcholine.
Police contacted laboratories throughout the United States to see if there was a test to find sectional Coleen in human tissue.
And they found none.
Investigators tried to locate the store where Steve purchased the cigars found in the hotel room.
Sergeant Joe gamble visited twenty six convenience stores in the vicinity of the recalls home in one he found the same brand of cigars.
When the clerk was shown pictures of Stephen Kim recalled.
She identified him as the one who purchased the cigars and beer.
She remembered she came in and bought a package of cigars and beer and I asked her why did you remember that.
The lady told me that she would like the color of Kimberly spare Kimberly has red hair and she asked him really where it was where she had her hair dyed.
National pension really got very upset whether told her this is my natural color.
By Kimberly getting upset with the clerk the clerk it embedded in her memory you know when she saw the picture she noticed and she thought it strange that this woman was buying a pack of cigars she actually done to find the same cigar so at that point I felt that we we had.
The cigars in Steve's hotel room at a price sticker printed with ink that match the printing and use by this convenience store confirming the cigars were purchased here.
But the state's case was very weak without scientific proof that an excel or it was you or that Steve had been injected with succinylcholine.
She'S married a man that she loved and then she won about a cold calculating way to kill this man in his prime of life leads me to believe that she's one of the most cold blooded murders that I've been involved with.
Thirty two year old Kimberly recall was arrested and charged with first degree murder and arson in the death of her husband she pleaded not guilty.
With no way to prove succinylcholine was in Steve's body and no scientific evidence and excel it was used to start the fire prosecutors were forced to use a process of conclusion by exclusion they had to rule out all other possibilities for how the fire started in an effort to convince the jury that Steve recall was merger.
This was a healthy young man who was in his mid thirties worked as a council person very fits who had died suddenly unexpectedly there was absolutely no medical disease process on actual disease process that was identifiable in his death.
And that he was in fact not intoxicated.
And in fact he had died before the fire and so.
From my point of view I could come up with a launch list of exclusions which led me to believe that in fact she had been always end with succinylcholine or some similar type of agent which we could not trace.
Prosecutors believe Kimberly recall planned her husband's murder long in advance the evidence the purchase of the additional two hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of life insurance the purchase of the beer and cigars and were sexual affair with another man.
Florida hearing court was many of her friends testified because she spoke to several of her friends and told them her plans to kill Mr Rico some in detail couple for friend she told in detail for plans.
Prosecutors believe Kim confiscated a pile of succinylcholine from the hospital where she worked.
After the murder mystery performance Kim waited for Steve to go to sleep.
Then injected him with a lethal dose of succinylcholine.
She then staged the scene to make it look like an accident.
She placed empty beer bottles in the trash can and on the night stand.
She moved Stevens body to the floor and placed a playboy magazine and the cigars nearby.
She called her husband's T. shirt over his head Houston excel orange identified by the excellent sniffing dogs and started the fire.
There was no carbon monoxide in Steve's bloodstream or any signs of smoke inhalation proof that Steve was dead before the fire started and there was no alcohol found in the system.
Test would reveal that the cigar was not enough to ignite the flame retardant fibers of the pillowcase alone.
Jim left the resort to create an alibi and returned around one thirty A. M. and reported the fire to hotel employees.
The motive Kim wanted to get rid of her husband so she would be free to pursue the relationship with her lover.
The defense argued that Stephen recalls death could have been caused by the fire and that his lack of consciousness might have been caused by the accumulation of chemicals he inhaled through his work at the golf course.
Kim was the last one in the room and she had a motive because of the insurance the science really provided a whole lot of negatives we excluded a lot of things but we did not provide anybody with a smoking gun and so I think that this case was done largely and really hinged on the superb investigation that was done by the state police troopers.
The jury found him Rico guilty of first degree murder and first degree arson.
She was sentenced to life in prison.
Now in the hands of the jury without the science Stephen Rico probably would have been buried and and we would've all thought this was this was just a horrible tragic fire death and and his case probably would have been labeled accidental death and he would have been buried and nobody would have ever known that's really sad how how this all ended what she put him through at the end she let him on to believe that that there was a chance and just I guess she was just thinking about doing a minute.
It'S pretty lousy.
I just know that his life was valued and nobody deserves such a thing and he was a very good man and most of all he was a good father.
And he loved his family and we loved him very much and we're very proud of him and I'd give anything to have him back.
Since this case went to trial scientists at the Karolinska institute in Sweden and now in the United States have developed protocols enabling the identification of succinylcholine even in and bomb tissue.
One of the many scientific forensic advances that occur almost daily.
