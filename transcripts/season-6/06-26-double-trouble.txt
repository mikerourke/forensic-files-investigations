This is the story of two crimes committed in different states five hundred miles apart.
In each case a woman was assaulted late at night.
Investigators found the same signature elements in both crimes.
The calling card of this perpetrator was so unusual.
It eventually cost him his life.
Perth Amboy New Jersey about an hour's drive from the hustle and bustle of New York City.
For three hundred years this riverfront town has been a haven for immigrants seeking a better life in America.
Melissa Padilla's parents came from Puerto Rico she and her four brothers grew up here yeah she was my right hand.
She was always helping me with them she.
She was like a second mother to an independent.
My spelling something I've never been able to handle it she was always there when I needed some help with that.
Melissa attended high school in Perth Amboy but quit in her junior year and later became pregnant.
She had three more children in rapid succession and in nineteen ninety four was unmarried and supporting herself and the children with a monthly welfare check.
Having technical skills or two that would demand a high paying job she would have to sue for minimum wage.
Melissa was able to scrape by for a while but then she fell behind on her rent and lost to report.
Melissa and her children then moved into the Jan motel.
One of several cheap motels located along route one a main north south artery in Avenel New Jersey.
On the night of August eleventh nineteen ninety four Melissa left the children with her boyfriend and walked to a nearby convenience store for some groceries.
At eleven at night.
Melissa left the store around eleven thirty and headed back to the motel.
But she never arrived.
Her boyfriend told police he found her half naked body later that night along the highway.
Melissa'S mother got the word shortly after the body was discovered.
You'Re not supposed to bury your children's.
Are you going to die before them.
No parents want their children.
Most murderous go to great lengths to avoid detection.
A lysis killer didn't seem to care committing his crime along the busy highway where he could have been easily seen.
When Melissa Padilla left her hotel room to buy food for her young children her group took along a well traveled highway to a nearby convenience store Melissa never returned.
Her boyfriend told police he found her body in a sewer pipe near the highway she was naked from the waist down the autopsy revealed she died as a result of the manual fixation and the soul.
There were several grocery items near the body as well as analysis blood spattered shorts found about half a block away with the pocket turned out.
But the most telling evidence came from Melissa's body itself our eyes were battered indicating that she had received punches from someone who was so strong and who was subdued her in that way the fact that she was naked and and that her general area was mutilated obviously indicated that there was a sexual assault.
Scrapings from under her fingernails revealed DNA that authorities hope would bring a conviction if they could only find the suspect.
Melissa'S autopsy revealed one other detail something Tom caps I could never seen in his thirty one years of prosecuting homicides.
She had bite marks on her chin and on her left breast indicating that there was probably some kind of ritualistic element to the killing.
Was particularly unusual I've done a lot of research and I've talked to a lot of people by March usually occurred to the general general areas to the breast to the stomach but I have never heard of one that occurred to the chin before.
Armed with this evidence New Jersey police began their search for Mullis's killer.
The security video from the quick check store where Melissa had bought groceries helped establish the time of the merger shortly before midnight.
It also showed the cashier giving her change.
But no money was found in Melissa's clothing indicating she had also been robbed.
Police also began canvassing the area looking for eyewitnesses there was a witness that was identified that was interviewed who indicated they were traveling past the roadway and saw what appeared to be two individuals and some sort of struggle standing up near the concrete pipes.
The witness could provide little useful information.
The battering about Melissa's face and the bite marks on her breasts and chan led police to theorize that her killer got a perverse pleasure out of assaulting women and might have struck before.
Just a mile from the murder scene was a prison for convicted sex offenders.
The prison record showed a number of released prisoners living in the area.
We then pull their files to determine what their M. O. was and whether they were involved in any kind of ritual when they committed their breast sex crimes they complied with requests for DNA samples they complied with example request for hairs they also submitted to a polygraph examinations that are conducted by the Woodbridge police department and they all were eliminated as suspects in the crime.
Melissa'S boyfriend who had stayed with her children was also eliminated sensually things started to appear that we have an unsolved homicide them with no suspect a to percent.
Eight months later five hundred miles away in Maine.
There was another assault strikingly similar to Melissa Padilla.
This crime was bold and brazen but the perpetrator made a mistake in choosing his victim.
She was a state trooper.
Months after the murder of Melissa Padilla police still didn't have a suspect.
The brutality of the assault led police to believe her killer took pleasure in attacking women and might strike again.
Eight months later state troopers in Maine reported a brazen assault on one of their own.
The assault took place on April third nineteen ninety five at about eight thirty PM trooper Vicki Gardner and eleven year veteran was off duty and driving her police cruiser south on interstate ninety five.
She came across a vehicle facing the wrong way on the interstate.
Excuse me Sir are you okay.
Gardiner discovered that the driver Stephen Fortin had been drinking.
Would you please get out of the car.
Since she was off duty she called for another police vehicle to take fourteen into custody the sense of one fourteen heard this he exploded.
Vicki Gardner was unconscious still in the vehicle when she regained consciousness she opened the passenger door and tried to jump out.
He was trying to reach out and grab all over again and she swung herself away from him and got away from him.
Vicki Gardner was lucky to be alive I have never seen a woman attacked that way damage that badly.
Who live to talk about it.
After Vicky jumped out of the vehicle fourteen lost control of the car and crashed.
He was later apprehended.
Lieutenant Lancaster interviewed him in prison.
He took no responsibility he was it was while we spoke although we spoke of the incident it was always somebody else's fault he I I knew that I was dealing with someone that was able.
Vicky had scrapes and bruises over her entire body interface was severely battered.
Fortin had not only punched and assaulted her he also left a bizarre calling card.
Two bite marks one on the outer area of her left breast the other on her chin.
Every aspect about it you knew the dealing with someone.
Who had done something like this before.
In fact check the police records importance home state of New Jersey revealed that he had a history of violence.
Fourteens name was well known to prosecutor caps that he had sent him to prison for seven years on a manslaughter charge fourteen got out after only two and a half years he had stabbed his brother in the throat in nineteen eighty three in the townships Carter at and was the project is that.
When the New Jersey state police heard the news of Steve for tons of salt in Maine they naturally wanted to find out if fourteen was in New Jersey on the night Melissa Padilla was killed.
An interview with fox news former girlfriend provided the answer.
And she told us that in August of nineteen ninety four Stephen Ford and did in fact live in Avenel New Jersey in fact he lived in an apartment with her.
And on the very night in question he assaulted her in the parking lot of a restaurant and she called the police and he ran.
That restaurant but Scott was a short walk from the jam motel where Melissa was living.
The police report listed the time of the assault on dawn archer as ten thirty PM an hour before Melissa was murdered at last authorities have a suspect Melissa's brother got the word a day after his birthday.
We consider it a birthday gift but I was glad that he did fine and I was praying that they will find before you could ever do that to someone else.
They found him but now they had to prove him guilty.
Prosecutors hope the DNA evidence taken from under Melissa's fingernails would incriminate Fortin but it did.
Was compared to Stephen Fortin from Maine's evidence that we obtained from them the DNA lab could not.
Include him or exclude him as a source.
With the DNA results inconclusive the bite marks on the two victims seem to be prosecutors best chance of linking pardon to Melissa Patillas murder.
Plasterk impression was therefore made on fortune's teeth.
Pression along with photographs of the bite marks were sent to doctor low living a respected forensic odontology just who worked for the New York state police.
These are Mister Ford's team to actually models of them and they're made the same way as the orthodontist would take models or the dentist takes models to do prosthetic devices if you take a look at the upper teeth he's got a space between those two middle front ones on the one on the right is bigger than the one on the left because to cap and in fact the biting surface is slightly wider also from front to back if you look at the models of lower teeth the very very straight across the bottom of them he's got almost no where on the insides alleges so they leave a linear markings rather than rectangles and they're very very straight across he's got the slightly pointed canines so he doesn't have a whole lot of where.
Levin compared fortunes teeth to the bite marks on Vicki Gardner and Alyssa Padilla.
He found them to be a match.
Leaving nothing to chance prosecutors also brought in Raleigh Hazelwood a former FBI profiler and an expert on criminal behavior.
He was interested in my study in the crimes to determine whether or not I could do a linkage analysis in the two crimes a linkage analysis is an in depth study of two or more crimes with the idea of attempting to determine whether or not they were committed by the same person.
Hazelwood concluded that the same man had indeed committed both crimes.
In the trial of Stephen Fortin began on October thirty first two thousand.
Trial with no eyewitnesses circumstantial evidence and in conclusive DNA fine.
The prosecutor's case rested almost entirely on the opinions of two forensic experts.
The murder of Melissa Padilla and the assault of a Maine state trooper were so strikingly similar this became a critical part of the prosecution's case.
Stephen fortunes trial Maine state trooper Vicki Gardner took the stand to describe how fourteen had beaten and sexually assaulted.
Then we had to bring in witnesses and that brought the two crimes together and they were Hazelwood and living.
Addressing the jury Hazelwood explained that some crimes like the murder of Melissa Padilla and the assault of trooper Gardner have unique patterns of behavior which he called rituals the ritual are those acts which are unnecessary to the commission of the crime and are carried out to meet the emotional needs of the offense.
In this case the need for psycho sexual gratification.
Hazelwood identified five examples of ritualistic behavior that were common to both cases.
By mark to the left breast.
Excessive battery to the upper portion of the face in both instances injurious anal penetration and manual strangulation from the front I've never seen that combination of behaviors in any other crime.
Then Dr Levin explained to the jury that no two people have teeth patterns that are exactly the same.
What I basically did was to show the jurors that people leave bite marks that looked different we used to the prosecutor's myself and one of the investigators.
So they have bite marks look different.
Dr Levine showed the jury overlays of Steve Martin's T. were able to show the jury how the overlays over the life size photographs of the bite mark on the victim we did it by animating the overlay so that it moves across the stream and stops exactly on the bite mark and it was it was very effective and it was very dramatic and I think it worked very well.
New Jersey authorities are coming for the jury deliberated Stephen port and stayed for two days before reaching their verdict.
In the penalty phase.
Prosecutors ask for the death sentence and concluded by explaining to the jury why fourteen had bitten his victims on the chance.
What we finally decided regarding the bite mark to the chin was that Stephen Ford was biting the victim on the chin while he was looking in her eyes and mutilating her genitals and that he was getting a perverse pleasure out of that.
On February twenty six two thousand one.
Fourteen was sentenced to die by lethal injection.
It was justice but I didn't feel like a vengeance justice should be served you know.
I was I was grateful Roy Hazelwood in Lowell Levine were absolutely critical to the case this case like most murder cases depended on circumstantial evidence on forensic evidence on expert testimony.
And the tools those experts have to draw on says Hazelwood are growing more and more sophisticated every year I'm continuously amazed at the strides we've made in investigating crimes and solving crimes and prosecuting crimes.
Even Ford and is now in Trenton state prison awaiting execution.
Melissa Diest sons are living with their father her daughters are being raised by Melissa's mom.
She'S a good person.
