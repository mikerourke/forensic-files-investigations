An elderly woman was found dead in her hotel room.
Was it a natural death or was it murder.
An alert doctor noticed the horrible infection on the finger of the hotel worker who would come to the emergency room for treatment of his injuries.
The virulence of that infection was to the mystery.
The Cincinnati the third largest city in Ohio.
It was named after the Roman statesman Lucius Cincinnatus whom legend held to be the model of virtue.
But in September of nineteen ninety four Rhoda Nathan a sixty seven year old grandmother visiting Cincinnati saw a different side of the city.
She was a person that you could not.
Avoid having a good time with her she was just a terrific lady.
She checked into this hotel in the Cincinnati suburb of blue ash it's a pretty nice hotel and does a pretty good convention business and nothing like this had ever happened there before.
Photo sharing room two thirty seven with her best friend of fifty years Alain shield and Elaine's boyfriend Joe Kaplan both visiting from Florida.
They were all there to attend the lanes grandson's bar mitzvah.
On Saturday morning Joe and Elaine woke early and left the room for breakfast at seven thirty.
Joe said he pulled the door shut making sure it was locked.
Rhoda stayed behind so she could shower and dress with some privacy.
After breakfast a half hour later Alain and Joe returned to the room.
Two hotel guests cardiologists and a registered nurse answered the couple's cries for help and immediately performed CPR believing Rhoda had suffered a heart attack and fall on.
Rhoda was rushed to the hospital but it was too late she was pronounced dead on arrival.
Later that day Alain discovered five hundred dollars in cash missing from the purse she had left in the room while at breakfast.
It was then Alain also realized that wrote this necklace was missing from her neck.
Police closed room two thirty seven as a crime scene.
This was one of the most heinous crimes that I've ever seen in my twenty five plus years in law enforcement bruises on rota space and chest indicated she had been beaten with at least two different objects in addition to someone's tests.
She died of a severe beating she she was just beaten to death that's the simplest way to put it the autopsy confirmed what police already suspected rode his death was a homicide.
I think it's a horrible thing for this community to have out of town visitors come in here and be brutalized in the nature that she was and hopefully we can bring some justice to this situation and.
We think the death penalty is appropriate for peace and justice.
Sixty seven year old grandfather road and Nathan was murdered in her hotel room just hours before she was to attend a bar mitzvah.
Since there were no signs of forced entry rota may have known the killer and willingly opened the door but since she was found naked and still wet from a shower this theory was abandoned.
A large blood stain was on the window curtains and a bloody footprint was found on the bathroom floor.
Service dreadful was like losing a member of the family she did nothing wrong.
She was calling for a good time.
And she was in the wrong place at the wrong time the motive appeared to be Robert.
Road is gold and diamond necklace was missing along with five hundred dollars in cash from a lane spurs.
The door to room two thirty seven days the hotel lobby atrium no one was seen entering the room we knew that whoever did this had to be at the hotel that morning between seven thirty and eight sort really limited the suspect pool and that was a big circumstance.
Investigators questioned hotel guests and employees since they would have access to room keys the death of road and Nathan wasn't the only incident at the hotel that day forty two year old Elwood Butch Jones hotel handyman had sliced his left hand on the end of the trash dumpster he had checked in the work maybe around six o'clock that morning and a couple people had seen him didn't seem like he had any physical problems get around eight thirty or nine o'clock people noticed the head is left hand wrapped.
Three days later Jones went to the hospital emergency room for treatment of his left index finger which had become severely infected.
Jones was seen by hand surgeon Dr John McDonough that was pretty benign as far as the cut it was a small cut already partially healed.
And I initially took him at his word that he had indeed cut it on a dumpster at work.
When Dr McDonough cut into Jones's finger infected tissue squirted ten inches across the operating room table.
The card was deep penetrating the capsule or sterile lining of Jones's finger joint Jones underwent two different operations antibiotic therapy and a five day hospital stay.
Doctors believe that Jones could have died have you not sought treatment and doctor McDonough suspected that his hand injury was not caused by a cut from a metal object.
Lab tests revealed that the cause of the infection was a virulent bacteria called I can now look corroded.
I can L. is found typically in the human mouth under dental plaque around the gum line to get the I can now to to propagate you have to break the dental plaque there has to be a significant injury and that happens when you break a tooth usually or if hard object comes in contact with it such as a fixture of the hand bone so just putting his hand in his mouth would not have given him I can now coincidentally two of Rhoda Nathan's teeth had been knocked out during the attack one tooth was found on the floor next to a body the other in her stomach.
Also suspicious Elwood Jones told doctors that he cut his hand on the trash dumpster but later he told co workers he cut it on some metal stairs.
So it's obvious that he was.
Concerned about how he had done this injury to his hand even though L. wood was intelligent he was too dumb to keep his story straight if you.
For the most brutal murder cases that I've ever heard of just the sheer viciousness of the beating and sheer senselessness of it just amazed me the first lead and rode a Nathan's murder came when a handyman Elwood Jones who worked in the same hotel suffered a serious hand injury on the same day of the murder.
At first police weren't overly suspicious until they learned that Jones had given co workers one explanation of the accident but told hospital employees another.
This prompted investigators to interview Jones surgeon Dr McDonough.
Well they wanted me to give them some information about Mr Jones and I told I was sorry that Mister Jones and I had a a doctor patient relationship and there was an ethical problem with me even talking to them about him in anyway the Ohio Supreme Court had already ruled that the patient position privilege of confidentiality is negated when police have reasonable cause to believe that an injury resulted from violence related to a crime.
Several days later they came back with the court orders and information to as a physician under the laws of the state of Ohio I was required to give testimony about a case of this nature.
Dr McDonagh said at first he took Jones is word that he cut his hand on a dumpster.
But after looking at the wound more closely Dr McDonough knew Jones was lying.
It happens when a clenched fist comes into contact with T..
Well our definition of a fight by is an injury to the hand usually over anyone of the knuckles when someone strike someone in the mouth during an argument what happens is the skin is penetrated by the edge of the tooth or the tooth may actually break off and that sharp edge will then and not kill the bacteria underneath the skin into the soft tissues of the hand I've been doing hand surgery for about twenty five years now and I've only seen it three times and every time I saw it was involved in a human bite injury involved in a fight.
The location of the cop don Jones is not called pointed to this conclusion as did the lab test which found the human mouth bacteria I can now look to rodents.
Hitting somebody in the mouth and cutting your hand is pretty they can to cutting your hand on the bottom of the sewer.
Dr McDonald Jones injury debate so unusual he took these photographs to show his medical students those photographs became a critical piece of evidence it was truly a case of serendipity because at that point in time we did not know the circumstances of Mr Jones's injury in what we thought was going to be a nice demonstration for a lecture turned out to be quite a bit more than that.
Further investigation into Jones's whereabouts on the day of Rohde's murder revealed he had signed out a master passkey that morning and never returned.
Elwood Jones also had a prior criminal history three convictions for burglary and theft with the search warrant investigators searched both Jones is home and that his girl friend and co worker lean Metcalf investigators examined Elwood Jones is clothes and shoes the shoes did not match the bloody footprints found at the crime scene and test on his clothes found no trace of road in Nathan's blind.
Jones is automobiles was a tool kit and the master passkey from the hotel two sets of door chains along with the gold and diamond pendant similar to the one road and then was seen wearing before her death.
Investigators suspected that the marks on the road this space may have been made by a door chain like the one found in Jones's trunk and the mark on her chest might have been caused by a walkie talkie radio similar to the one Jones used at the hotel.
The autopsy photographs were not taken exactly parallel to the victim's body creating a slight angular distortion and accurate photographic comparison of the wounds to these items would be impossible.
It wasn't quick it wasn't painless I'm sure she'll lay on the floor for quite a while hoping her friends would come back and she didn't die right away the brutal murder of road and Nathan was a terrible shock to our son and to all who knew and loved her.
She was vibrant she was up she was an optimist.
She was just had a great sense of humor she was most proud about her kids which is I guess what most of us try to be proud of.
J. two lovely sons and done very nicely nice family my scripture.
Before going on trial.
Investigators wanted to know if any of the items in Jones's tool box had been used in the assault.
But investigators had a problem.
Distortions in the autopsy photos made it difficult to analyze the patterns of road is injuries.
But police learned that the FBI had recently developed a new technology to correct perspective distortions and photographs called photo rectification.
Machines adjustable table is first positioned to merit the camera angle at the time the original photo was taken.
The table is then moved to transform the plane on the photograph to a flat surface plane as viewed from directly overhead.
So this machine had the ability to actually rectifying poor to correct the imperfection in the way the photograph was taken.
Next investigators took the rectified photos to the armed forces institute of pathology.
The father just there are experts in the study of injuries caused by weapons.
The color of the autopsy photographs were altered along with the brightness and contrast to distinguish the injuries from marks caused by internal bleeding.
Experts could not exclude Jones is a walkie talkie as the cause of rotis chest bruise although it did not correspond exactly.
They did not have DNA and they did not have blood evidence or hair samples or fibers but they did have this rather unusual technique of showing how the radio may have matched up to the brewers and.
Prosecutors believe that when a lane and Joe left their hotel room for breakfast Jones was watching and thought the room was empty.
He took this tool kit and a door chain so he could say he was doing some room maintenance in case the couple came back early Jones used the master passkey signed out earlier that morning.
Inside he took the five hundred dollars in cash from the pocketbook Dan roda Nathan emerge from the bathroom still wet from the shower.
He struck this is Nathan in the face with a door chain in his hand and struck her on the chest with his walkie talkie he also struck road in the mouth with its best removing two teeth and picking up the virulent bacteria which caused the infection.
Before leaving Jones took the diamond necklace from road is neck and left she may have even been alive and conscious when the one thing that meant the most of her that she never took off we snatched off her neck that's the kind of guy with Jones as you know to him it was a little trinket to her it was the main connection to her family took her husband to her whole background.
The necklace found in Jones's toolbox was positively identified as belonging to road and Nathan.
Unbeknownst to Elwood genesis was a one of a kind piece of jewelry in fact the victim in this case her husband headed specially made for her from his own mother's wedding ring there were five small diamonds that were made in a very unique pendant it was so special to her that even if she was taking a shower even if she was swimming even if she was sleeping this pendant never ever left her neck.
Dr McDonough testified that Jones is hand injury and the I. Cannella Kuroda's bacteria with the result of Jones this coming into contact with human teeth and not on the metal dumpster has Jones claimed.
There was a lot of argument about how that by kind of that how that injury could have been infected but the doctor was very compelling and core when he said there is no other way it could have been infected other than from the human mouth and that proved very compelling to the jury I'm sure but of all the hospitals in the city and of all the doctors the one guy that Elwood Jones handed up just by circumstance being assigned to that night was doctor McDonough and that's again I can't say I feel sorry for L. would but I'm convinced had he gone to any other doctor this case would have been solved.
The enhanced photographs of rotors injuries suggested Elwood Jones walkie talkie and the door chain from his tool box with the most unlikely items used in the attack.
I'M still not here Elwood Jones said he was framed by police who he claimed had planted rode his necklace in his toolbox his contention was that he did nothing wrong he was just doing his job that day and they picked him out simply because he had a record.
The jury deliberated just ten hours Elwood Jones was found guilty of aggravated murder aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery.
The good news is that was an asshole I mean I don't know if I'm allowed to say that or not but you know I've tried serial killers that don't bother me as much as L. with Jones he was just an error again he was nasty to his attorney he's just a nasty individual based upon a review of the court finds itself in complete with absolute agreement with a recommendation the jury.
Elwood Jones was sentenced to death outside the court room over Jones's sister reacted angrily to the sentence what happened in the court today it is crazy dog blue ash police department my brother.
Prosecutor the judge and everybody needs to be looked at in this case in this case was interesting for a lot of reasons and not just because it happened in a place where you normally don't have this kind of violence that made it more shocking maybe but the most interesting things about this case were some of the scientific evidence that came into place in the forensic evidence that they found it was not the kind of evidence you see in a lot of cases I'd like to tell him to start making peace with his maker because I think in the very near future he's going to meet his maker and he's gonna pay for the vicious murder that he committed I'd like to pull the switch.
Well what I say to him.
I'D say I hope you die slowly and painfully.
