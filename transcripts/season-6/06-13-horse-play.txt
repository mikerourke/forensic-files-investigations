On a warm summer evening in nineteen eighty a young married couple took their horses out for a leisurely ride through the woods.
The autopsy confirmed it was an accident but the family wasn't so sure.
Dale county Michigan population just over forty thousand this is farm country soybeans and corn mostly a hospitable place where friends drop in unexpectedly and there's always room for one more at the dinner table.
Twenty five year old Shannon Moore was a quiet unassuming young woman who grew up in nearby to lido Ohio.
She was a very good student in school and she said when she was in first grade she went to Catholic school I'll be in non interest and she became a nurse.
In September of nineteen seventy nine Shannon Moore met an eligible bachelor from Hillsdale county thirty six year old David Davis the two men at a friend's wedding.
Channing came home from the wedding of this other nurse and said mom I met this real nice man.
And he's fast we spent the whole evening together we had such a wonderful time he told me he was a millionaire he has farms all over the United States an in police and he's going to call me please have a date set up I thought the world of a mile from the very beginning.
He was just a kind of a rugged outdoor type person like the fission on I thought he was good to my daughter and that's the only thing that I cared about and I said to our Shannon gill at this one get away from your nuts.
After an eight week courtship Shannon and David married and moved to David's Michigan farm it seems to be the ideal place to raise a family.
They bought to Tennessee walking horses which were recommended because of their gentle nature.
On July twenty third nineteen eighty ten months after the wedding Shannon and David rode their horses to see their neighbor.
I was having a problem with some farm machinery so David spent time helping we work probably half an hour on this tool.
I want to turn around until we're sure go ahead and take him and Dave said no all you come get him in the morning you know Shannon had asked me the question and answer.
And so I dropped it.
David and Shannon and mounted their horses and left.
Instead of going back the way they came they took a short cut through the woods.
A short time later David raced out of the woods back today Britain's far.
Davis said the channels horse and she said she fell and hit her head on a rock.
Shannon was lying on her back arise will close there was blood on the back of her head.
Shannon'S blouse was on and on and sneakers were off which Britain thought was unusual.
I think we better get into the car.
Shannon was rushed to the nearest hospital now long horn to blow that could.
And this nurse come runner now nice is we needed to we need a doctor I saw run to the front Tellem's she's hurt bad.
Shannon'S lifeless body was wheeled into the emergency room where doctors checked for vital signs.
There weren't any.
The time of death was arbitrarily set at eight forty five PM.
The wound in the back of Shannon's head and the X. rays taken at the hospital were consistent with David's explanation she had fallen from a horse and hit her head.
Her death certificate listed the cause of death as multiple cranial and cervical spine injuries.
Sen Shannon died in one county and was declared dead in another no autopsy was performed because of the jurisdictional mix up.
Shannon Moore had to lifelong dream the first to become a nurse the other to raise a family.
She graduated from nursing school and had been married less than a year.
Reams for a family would never be fulfilled because of a freak horseback riding accident which took her life at twenty six.
When Shannon's parents Lucille and Bob Moore arrived at the hospital her husband David Davis was in the whole crime.
The old instinctively hugged each other just as the only state.
Will grant me as he grabbed me he ran his hand under my face and I looked and it was three deep scratches.
And I mean deep scratches.
Chapman'S father had other concerns David insisted that Shannon's body be cremated as a Catholic Bob Moore was opposed the more family wanted to take Shannon's body back to Ohio to bury her there.
At that point Britain's stepped in.
Her mother was crying Bob was Cryin so I stood right at me L. damage today that's our folks they said nobody knows are out here I said let let him take her back to Julie one barrier there I should people conger grave with flowers on it I said she don't know anybody here and he backed down said okay.
The next day deputies from the Hillsdale county sheriff's department visited the scene of the accident.
They found the bloody rock the only rock for some distance around not far away Shannon's untied sneakers lying about five feet apart.
And it was an area where the grass had been matted down.
Then looked around a little bit took a few pictures and left.
I ask about the shoes and I said now you can have.
Over the next several days the more is made arrangements to bury their daughter.
David'S parents whom the Morris had never met came to the funeral.
And what they had to say made it clear that everything David had told the moors about his past was a lie.
He was not a millionaire he didn't own farms all over the country and even more shocking was the fact that he had been married before and had two daughters.
The Morris believes their daughter's death was no accident.
Britain had come to the same conclusion because of something Davis had said the day after Shannon's death so the next morning were set at my table and he wants to know about the neighbor he served as a neighbor still want sellers farm and I said ha and he said never mind and I'm thinking how can you be thinking of buying the farm the next morning after your wife died.
Then he left and I does that is kept working on.
A week after Shannon's death Britain and the Morris took their suspicions to the Hillsdale county sheriff's office.
The Morris discovered the Davis have taken out insurance policies on Shannon's life totaling three hundred thirty thousand dollars during the ten months they were married.
The more is demanded an autopsy.
And Sherman's body was exhumed a month after her death.
The autopsy revealed a three and a quarter inch gash on the back of Shannon's head along with bruises on her upper back left shoulder upper right arm right hand and left cheek.
But they found no evidence of foul play.
The coroner concluded the Channon died of the head injury.
The sheriff's department considered the case closed.
Leave it or not yes when they first brought her up and said there was no evidence.
I thought the missing something there has to be.
And I knew that we had to keep going one way or another because something was wrong.
The Morris weren't the only ones who were suspicious.
Billy Bowles a reporter for the Detroit Free Press son covered some devastating information on David Davis painting him as a consummate liar who lived off money gained from suspicious insurance claims one claim was for a questionable fire on a farm Davis once owned.
The vacant farmhouse burned and he collected about thirty thousand dollars insurance for that.
the barn burned mysteriously while he was away and.
Any collected six thousand dollars for that.
in addition to those he had left the job at.
Freisler after the very suspicious injury.
and he was collecting workman's compensation.
And social security for that.
News investigation revealed among other things the Davis had studied pharmacology in college.
Armed with this new information the more family asked the state's Attorney General to open a new investigation.
Shannon'S autopsy revealed she died of a single blow to our head detective don Brooks had two theories number one this young lady actually felt no horses struck the only rock around squarely and it really is an accent or number two he killed her and the only way in my opinion for him to get her in a position where he could slam her head into that rock was to have a completely immobilized.
So we wanted to look at the possibility that she was drugged at the time something that would paralyze Sir but leave her heart still pumping and still she's still alive.
With Davis's background in pharmacology police asked local veterinarians what drugs farmers use with their animals that can cause paralysis.
One of the drugs mentioned was a powerful muscle relaxant named succinylcholine Houston animal surgery after anesthesia has been induced they will go ahead and give you some such an ill Coleen and what it will do is completely paralyzed every.
What we call skeletal muscle it won't hurt the heart but it will all the intercostal muscles which help and breathing or anything that you used to voluntarily move.
It will absolutely prevent those muscles from functioning.
It'S also used in humans in large doses succinylcholine can be fatal.
But there was a problem.
Sectional Coleen is broken down in the body almost immediately and is therefore undetectable.
If this was the drugs David Davis used on Shannon.
He had gotten away with murder.
In the seven months and Shannon Morris death her husband David Davis sold his Michigan farm and move to the Bahamas where he lived on a sailboat with his new girlfriend.
Davis was waiting for the conclusion of Shannon's investigation so that he could collect the three hundred thirty thousand dollars from our life insurance policies.
Although the autopsy was consistent with Davis's version of her death.
Rhymes seen wasn't.
Davis said he and Shannon were riding back to their farm Sherman's horse threw her to the ground and your head hit a rock.
The rock she hit was the only one within a hundred yards.
For some unexplained reason Shannon's blouse was unbuttoned and her shoes were removed and placed a few yards away the grass was matted around the body.
Police wondered whether Davis might have injected Shannon with some kind of paralyzing agent like succinylcholine before her death.
There was no known test to identify succinylcholine.
But local scientists heard about a new test developed in Sweden which was having some success finding succinylcholine even in an bomb takes you.
Dr Robert Forney and Tom Carroll took Shannon's tissues to the Caroline skate institute in Sweden.
It took a team of toxicologist several weeks of trial and error just to extract a sample of the contest.
We'Re working ten hour days working on trying to get the method perfected once we got the method perfected then we started analyzing all of Shannon's tissues.
The tests were conducted with the mass spectrometer which bombards chemical molecules with high on shattering them into their molecular components the fragmentation creates a chemical fingerprint that can be compared to other chemical fingerprints to determine the unknowns identity.
After weeks of testing and hundreds of tests scientists finally got a break I looked over a one quarter and then that one quarter was one piece of paper and on that piece of paper was a perfect mass spectra of such an oak only.
And that piece of paper was identified to have come from Shannon's tissue.
When prosecutors in Michigan learned the news they were related but they didn't feel it was enough.
They wanted more evidence and needed to know where Davis had injected her.
As a result for the second time Shannon's body was exhumed.
The vast majority of the injuries sustained by Shannon were on the left side of her body her left shoulder for left back in the left side of her head which would indicate a false.
To the left and then falling on your left on her right side however there was a cruise in the upper right quadrant of the right arm.
So those were the only bruises that you saw on her.
He discovered the channels right wrist and upper arm at the much higher concentrations of succinylcholine than her other tissues an indication that Davis had injected her twice.
Based on that evidence David Davis was finally charged with Shannon Moore's murder when police went to arrest Davis he was nowhere to be found.
The search for Davis dragged on for months and then years.
Police believe that David Richard Davis murdered his wife by injecting her with the lethal drug making the death look like a horseback riding accident.
Four eight and a half years Davis alluded police before they finally got a break.
Story about Shannon's murder appeared on network television an old girl friend of Davis is called police with the ten.
She called and she wanted to tell me about an individual that she thought could be David Davis she knew him by different names however she was very very reluctant to get involved she was in fear of her own life.
revealed the Davis was living in American Samoa with the Samoan wife under the name David Meyer bells.
In the eight years since Shannon's death he had lived in California Alaska and Hawaii you've taken flying lessons and had become an expert bush pilot.
The FBI arrested Davis at the pongal pongal airport and he returned to Michigan for trial.
We know that he courted and dated several women before Shannon and ask each of them to marry him in an extremely short period of time something like fourteen months he has five different women to marry him.
the first one who said yes became his victim.
Bloomer said the motive was money and that the murder was premeditated.
Prosecutors believe that after the couple left Dick Britain's farm Davis coach chan on offer horse under the pretext of having sex.
The couple had a habit of making love outdoors.
Sean and took off her shoes and unbuttoned her blouse prosecutors believe Davis snuck up behind her and injected the succinylcholine in the shoulder.
The injection didn't take effect immediately the two fought mapping down the grass.
Dan chairman on the head with the rock and injected her again this time in the rest.
If you were given an injection of succinylcholine outside of the hospital where they can help you breeze by a respirator you'll die of suffocation and that's exactly what happened to Sharon Davis.
I believe that the sexual calling answered the ever present question the jury's mind and that was if she didn't die from being thrown off a horse than what killed her we had to have that answer for the jury.
The jury deliberated for two and a half hours.
My heart was pounding so hard and I thought.
Over got it.
David Davis was found guilty of first degree murder.
Instead of standing around and shaking hands that I had to leave I had to leave the courtroom there's a law library right off the court room and I had to go in there.
He was sentenced to life in prison.
No we went out to the cemetery right afterwards.
I said that I shouldn't feel too bad that he fooled us.
I think I heard living.
The killer all that time ten months.
