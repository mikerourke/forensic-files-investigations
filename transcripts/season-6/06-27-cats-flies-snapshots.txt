In nineteen eighty nine near the Pocono mountains in Pennsylvania nineteen year old glory all Kerr left for work.
She was never heard from again.
And the family cat that helps solve her disappearance in a most unusual way.
Susquehanna valley in central Pennsylvania is a quiet agricultural area.
Laurie Walker grew up here not far from the mighty Susquehanna River.
Lori was a very sweet girl she was typical nineteen year old she had a lot of goals and aspirations for her future as far as becoming a veterinarian and had a great deal of interest in animals.
Just out of high school Laurie married Robert Walker he was almost ten years older and worked in a warehouse.
Not long afterwards the couple had a son Matthew.
Laurie took a job at a local store to earn extra money she shared her love of animals with their son Matthew at every opportunity when she wasn't working she commented on show him he particularly like kittens and should bring in showing the kittens and he liked watching the fish playing with the puppies she was a good mother.
Although Lori and Robert loved their child problems between the two began to surface.
The couple argued and friends say they were unable to resolve their differences.
Just eighteen months after they were married Lori and Robert.
Lori and the baby moved in with her parents Robert moved in with his aunt had visitation rights she wasn't happy with him because he was had a very controlling type nature about.
She had to answer all his questions before she could go anywhere.
He used physical.
As a plan whenever he got upset with Matt.
While separated Laurie dated occasionally but only casual.
On may twenty fourth nineteen eighty nine while Matthew was at Robert's house Laurie prepared for her usual four to nine shift at the pet store.
After packing a snack Laurie left for work.
The supervisor called looking for.
And I asked them if Lori had left for work and and her father said that she had been and I said well has she called or anything because she's she's not here at the story and she is scheduled to start.
About a half an hour ago he said no he said that this makes me very worried he said that she left on time.
Laurie'S father drove the route that she usually took to work he thought she might have had car trouble along the way.
Eventually found Lori's car in the parking lot near the pet shop where she usually parked.
Nothing seemed to be out of place.
Purse and keys were not in the car the disappearance frightened people the thought that some young woman could go to a mall a very busy mall in broad daylight and suddenly disappear presumably being abducted.
Really shocked a shock wave of fear throughout that rather conservative small.
Police canvassed the area and questioned employees and shoppers in the mall but no one saw anything suspicious.
Almost from the start.
A suspected lorries estranged husband Robert may have had something to do with her disappearance.
But Robert said he hadn't seen Laurie at all that day and he had an alibi he said he was babysitting their son went shopping and then went to scheduled appointments Mister Walker told me that on the day of Lorenz disappearance that he had been over to Weis markets to get a disability claim form.
And he took that form to an office in Lewisburg an orthopedic surgeon.
And from there he went to the Bloomsburg Sears mall in price the dishwasher for his mother police are now asking for the public's help for the next three weeks police family members friends and volunteers continue to search with no success.
On June twelfth a woman jogging a few miles from the mall spotted something in an area known as slow days down.
It was little more than the skeleton.
Investigators wondered whether this was the body of Laurie OFC and look to forensic science for some way to town.
The body was markedly decompose in that only in the extremities were there any flash laugh there was no skin and no organs internally that to to work with.
Investigators needed to identify the skeleton found in the dump a few miles from the pet store.
And they also wanted to know the cause of death.
From the size of the skull he knew the body was female the cut marks on the bones and the holes in the clothing helped him to determine the cause of death.
Corresponded to perforations in the sweater is.
Consistent with stab wounds with movement and with homicide.
Doctor Metallica's concluded that this woman had been stabbed in the chest and back at least seven times possibly as many as eleven.
But he wasn't able to make an identification from the remains.
For that doctor Metallica's asked forensic odontology just doctor Dennis basin to make the dental comparison without the benefit of forensic dentistry when you have a victim such as Laurie ocas in Lori out because there are are no fingerprints that you can use the body is unrecognizable because of the disintegration of dishes very often the only thing it does remain is the dental evidence that we can compare to before death records and and establish a positive identification after comparing the teeth of the victim to Lori's dental records and X. rays doctor ace and made a positive identification the victim had nine teeth restored with dental materials those teeth to as it turned out were the same teeth at Lori aka had restored the same nineteenth the same type of material in each to the same location of materials or restorations in each tooth that matched up with Laurie aka.
No murder weapon was found at the scene investigators now wanted to know when Lori di.
Time of death is usually determined in one of three ways first by the body temperature useless in this case given the length of time the body was outside.
Another way is to examine stomach contents but the body was too badly decomposed.
Third way is to analyze any insect activity.
Forensic entomologist Dr Kate Chong Kim studied the larvae found on the body and entomologist is an expert in the study of insects what this body had laws that large number of different kinds of Beatles and then not pay a bit late to stage maggots.
Within minutes of death blow flies can detect the smell of decomposition even from miles away.
Dr Kim calculated that the larvae deposited by the flies have been on the body for nineteen days which meant they were on the body the day Lori disappear.
In an incredible stroke of luck police learned that an automated teller machine near the entrance to the mall was equipped with the surveillance camera which took pictures every ten seconds.
The camera was aimed in the direction of Lori's car at first glance the images look on important.
They showed a man making up transaction.
But in the background out of focus there appeared to be an automobile near Lori's car with an unidentified person standing nearby.
The bridge to the parking lot was a scene that was captured on this video the scene was a little blurry I would like it to like a an offer Hitchcock kind of movies.
The images look promising but we're not clear enough for any kind of analysis so prosecutors asked both the Pennsylvania state police laboratory and the FBI for help but neither one could improve the photographs.
With nowhere else to turn the F. B. I. suggested they asked NASA for help.
NASA had been using sophisticated digital photo enhancement technology to improve images from space.
Nasser referred the case to research scientist Alan teaching of the ballistic missile defense organization.
Going to the gym used a technique similar to the one used to determine the cause of the challenger explosion in nineteen eighty six.
Digitization is the process of taking the normal video signal that you would get out of here VCR at home and turning it into a computer image file.
When the images are put into the computer they are broken down into thousands of pixels.
Each of these pixels are converted into a number representing how bright that daughters in this particular case the data is black and white video so that the pixel represents simply different shades between total black and and full white.
Digital enhancement can also remove blurring internet.
And special filters can eliminate some of the grain.
Once complete you can see how this process significantly improve the images.
Prosecutors hoped that these enhanced photographs would tell the story of Laurie Walker's disappear.
The digitally enhanced surveillance photos of the parking lot where Lori akhir disappeared showed Lori's car in its parking spot standing behind it was the person in the same clothing Laurie wore that day the film was in black and white on that particular scene we knew that Lori had been wearing a windbreaker that day wearing jeans and carrying a white person she was of medium build she at the shore.
Brown hair that person that we see in the picture there fits that description precisely.
The next picture taken ten seconds later shows another automobile diagonally in front of Laurie with the passenger side door open.
You can see that Laurie is bent over looking into the car.
The final picture shows Lori's car still in its parking spot but Laurie is gone the car Lori was standing next to his leaving the parking lot.
The person was described as Laurie Walker cannot be seen and we know circumstantially that she never made it into the door so that we believe was a depiction of her abduction.
An automobile expert identified the get away car as a Chevrolet celebrity.
All the lorries estranged husband Robert didn't own a Chevrolet celebrity his parents did Robert's parents told police that Robert had borrowed their car on the day Lori disappeared they said they sold the car a week after Robert return police tracked it through three different car dealerships.
Hanzal within the used car industry a few times and was ultimately purchased first consumer the purchase that was a retired state police officer.
The police officer bought the vehicle for a stepdaughter who have not yet reached driving age so it'd been sitting in a garage a lucky break for investigators.
It still maintains its integrity by the time we got to it we were able to access the vehicle tested scientifically for prince for trace evidence.
Investigators searched the car but could find no traces of blood anywhere inside well we did have some neighbors observe Robert akhir scrupulously cleaning that car the day after Laurie disappear.
But in the trunk of the car they found.
Chinese strand of hair.
Under a microscope the hair did not appear to be human.
On the left is a human hair on the right the hair from Robert strong.
Under an electron microscope magnified thousands of times the outer pattern of the hair was more box like than human hair similar to the steps on a ladder.
The blue specks are dust particles.
After looking through numerous species of hair.
Scientists discovered it was a cat hair.
Investigators compared that hair to a cat hair from Lori's parents capped and found they were microscopically similar.
This was significant since the cap belonged to Lori's parents Robert didn't have access to this cat and the cat never resided with Robert and Lori when they lived together.
What was also significant.
Robert'S parents didn't own attacked and Lori had never been in Robert's parents car before her disappearance investigators believed that this cashier was proof that Laurie had been in the trunk of Robert's car.
Robert Dr Louis parents were going to be trading that vehicle in within a matter of days in my opinion that's why he is that vehicle and AutoZone to a doctor Laurie with this evidence in hand police arrested Robert Walker for the murder of his estranged wife my rest Robert Walker he said to me you've got to be kidding.
What the worst part of it.
To me other than the fact that she died was when we were told that he had thrown her party in the dump.
There'S no reason for someone like for it to wind up.
Prosecutors believe the surveillance photographs supported their theory that Robert ducted Laurie in the mall parking lot.
To convince a jury prosecutors needed to prove that the automobile in the pictures was the Chevrolet owned by Robert Walker's parents.
So they reconstructed the crime they place the Chevrolet Robert was driving in the mall parking lot and took photographs from the same position hi and at the same millimeter as the surveillance camera but this time.
The background was in focus.
At the top is the original surveillance picture of lorries alleged abduction at the bottom is the recreation photographs.
The vehicles in both pictures look identical.
And prosecutors discovered a possible motive for the murder money.
Parker had taken out an insurance policy on Laurie and on his son listing himself as a beneficiary he had taken that policy out after they separate.
And Robert and Lori had been engaged in a custody dispute over their son another possible motive.
A background check the proper doctor revealed that he had a troubled past.
Robert Oscar had been in trouble most of his life as a juvenile up to his system.
Shortly after he married Lori Robert was convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol and served a brief stint in prison.
While there Robert ordered a book that described in detail how to commit a murder and get away with it.
The title of the book will not be revealed in this program for obvious reasons police officials blocked the delivery of this order.
Prosecutors believe that on may twenty fourth nineteen eighty nine as Lori drove into the mall parking lot Robert was there waiting.
I need you to come with me right away when Robert drove up and opened the door he may have used some type of excuse to get Lori in sight possibly their son was sick and he needed her help.
Prosecutors admit they don't know where the murder took place the forensic evidence doesn't say all they know is that Lori was in Robert's trunk sometime that day and was stabbed numerous times in the chest and back before her body was left at the dock.
When Robert leader please the problem he couldn't see the almost microscopic evidence Laurie left behind.
It was an ironic twist given loris lifelong love of animals.
Just all around nice she was nice to animals she was nice to people.
Robert order was found guilty of first degree murder and kidnapping and was sentenced to death.
On appeal the sentence was reduced to life in prison without parole.
NASA'S help was an important forensic breakthrough since it was one of the first times at crime scene photo had undergone digital video enhancement.
The enhancement of the video from the ATM machine was something brand new something that had never been done before this is a case that set a trend for prosecutors certainly throughout Pennsylvania I think there was an awakening a scientific awakening on the part of police on the part of prosecutors they realized suddenly that there were other tools at their disposal that perhaps they hadn't considered before and ironically those tools have now become somewhat routine.
