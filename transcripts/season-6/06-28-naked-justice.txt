This is the story of a classic love triangle husband wife and lover.
One of these three died in what was described as a nice.
A forensic computer analysis uncovered photographs and emails so revealing they even embarrassed a local judge.
Detroit Michigan nicknamed the motor city for its history as one of the world's largest automotive manufacturing hops.
Just west of Detroit is Michigan State University with almost forty thousand students.
In nineteen ninety Michael Mick Fletcher was an undergraduate student there with hopes of one day becoming a lawyer.
At a campus social event make Fletcher met Leanne Meisner who wasn't a student but worked as a telemarketer nearby.
For both it was love at first sight and they were inseparable.
Three years later in September of nineteen ninety three make and Lee and married that was great he was going to be a lawyer so he make a lot of money down to buy a nice house and she wanted to stay home and have a lot of babies.
That'S all she wanted in life hi Todd said she was a little girl I she wanted to do was to get married and have children.
The newlyweds settled in hazel park a working class suburb just north of Detroit.
They bought this house on Hazelwood Avenue and make started law school.
Leanne worked to support them and not long afterwards the couple had a daughter Hannah.
She just she just crazy about Hannah.
The Fletcher household appeared to be a happy one.
By nineteen ninety nine make was an up and coming criminal defense attorney working hard to build his practice.
On August twelfth nineteen ninety nine the couple had more good news Leanne learned she was pregnant with their second child.
Make was delighted with the news and center a note.
And I might not always tell you what you mean the world to me I love you so much sweetheart and girl or boy so long as they're part of you our children will all be beautiful I love you.
Sunday night the couple celebrated their good fortune with Leigh Ann's parents make asked his in laws if they would watch their granddaughter Hannah the next day.
Make believe than having a gun in the house for protection and he wanted Lee and to learn how to use.
After visiting the firing range McKinley and decided to return home to spend some quiet time together before picking up their daughter.
It'S just a few minutes after they arrived home make made a frantic call to police.
Police found Leanne dead on the bedroom floor naked from the waist down.
All through her right here.
Make told police he and Leon were sitting on the bed together reloading the forty five caliber Smith and Wesson they just used at the firing range he had trouble in the second clip so he gave it to land help.
He put the gun down in the gun box at the foot of the bed got out went to the bathroom to wash his hands and that's when he heard the gun go off.
He came running out of the bathroom and saw his wife lying on the floor.
The last thing everyone in my life.
And then to have to bury one so young.
So young so beautiful.
At first glance it appeared to be an act.
But police decided to take a second look and then a third.
As part of the investigation into Leanne Fletcher's death police first needed to eliminate the possibility of suicide.
Perhaps Leigh Ann's pregnancy had caused some depression.
Suicide let alone go through with it nine million years.
Fletcher told police his wife accidentally shot herself in their bedroom shortly after a trip to the firing range as she tried to reload their pistols.
Lian'S mother suspected that an accidental shooting in the head with a little too convenient this was a terrible accident should been shot in her hand her arm her foot in the wall I said it wouldn't be under had.
In the couple's bedroom police noticed bloodstains on the carpet under in the end's body as well as under the gun and click.
And there was blood spatter on the computer stand by the bad.
There was more blood spatter on the edge of the bed spread.
The medical examiner Dr Luby said Dragovic performed Leigh Ann's autopsy.
There was no gun powder residue in the bold.
But there were some tiny dots of gun powder called stippling embedded in the skin around the wound.
The density of this plane pattern indicated that the muscle of the firearm was twelve to eighteen inches away from Leigh Ann's hand when the gun went off.
And the trajectory of the bullet was almost horizontal and unusual for a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head in order to accomplish that Iran has to be about four foot long this lady is only twenty three inches or twenty three and a half inches long right.
When police searched the couple's home they found a brown folder in next office containing numerous romantic greeting cards.
Inside pictures of Susan sure now ski a local District Court judge.
Investigators also discovered that Mick had earned seventeen thousand dollars in legal fees from cases assigned by and presided over by judge Susan sure now ski.
If the two were romantically involved this was a gross violation of legal ethics.
Investigators seize the structure is home computer and Susan sure now skis office computer for examination by a forensic computer expert for years and years we've always been willing to look at a file cabinet for some type of an incriminating documents.
Or using file cabinets anymore they're using computers.
Sergeant do you copy the hard drive from the confiscated computers onto a forensic examination the computer which is equipped with special software that can access password protected files and reconstruct documents which have been deleted.
Sergeant deal found nude photographs of judge sure now ski and hundreds of emails between her and make a red S. love.
They appear to be intimate they appear to be lovers they talk about being together they talked about wanting to be together in the future.
Make had been corresponding with the judge for seventeen months.
Police also learned that before she died Leanne had suspected her husband was having an affair and the couple separated.
But three months later they reconciled and moved back in together.
Police no longer believe that Leigh Ann's death was an accident.
And we're beginning to suspect that Mick Fletcher and the judge might be in.
When investigators discovered that attorney Mick Fletcher was having an affair with the sitting judge at the time of his wife's death both were considered suspects.
As far as I'm concerned that's what she is.
Judge Susan sure now ski denied she had anything to do with Leigh Ann's death but she was able to provide some useful information so I asked the judge when was the last time they had sexual relations she stated the night before the homicide this meant that after having dinner with Leigh Ann's parents make dropped his wife and daughter off at home and made some excuse so that he could secretly meets with his lover.
She believe there was no sexual relationship between himself and Leanne.
And she told us that if there was a sexual relationship between Michael and Lee and that their relationship would be over and also now at the time of her death she was three weeks four weeks pregnant that we believe that that was indeed the motive for for her death.
Make insisted that Leigh Ann's death was an accident.
He claimed Leanne was reloading their guns.
The evidence in a different story.
And extra were found on the floor and not in Leigh Ann's hand in a lot of cases where people shoot themselves the gun is still in their hand because of anatomy that I can't explain the body grabs a gun.
If the gun had been in her hand when the shot was fired the guns would have prevented the blood from striking the palm of her hand.
And there was blood on the carpet underneath the gun and extra.
It should have been on top of those items with blood underneath the items.
And by the dresser there was a shell casing standing on end and everything look like it was placed we swap lance can and send it to a lab to determine whether or not there was any type of gun powder residue that may have been left and came back negative.
A phenol salines chemical test found blood on the right.
Using the stereo microscope Woodford saw high velocity impact blood spatter on the right cuff.
A fine mist of tiny blood particles had been driven deep into the fiber is.
To me it was critical because it pretty much took his story.
And didn't give it any credibility at all there is no way that he could have been in the bathroom at the time of the shooting.
High velocity impact blood spatter is created when a gunshot wound it's an area with plot and a fine mist of blood flows back toward the gun.
Headley and shot herself investigators say there would have been high velocity impact blood spatter on her hand and there was not it doesn't make any difference if there are additional drops of blood that occur later smoke contaminated on top of it some some smudging occurs there will still be areas that allow for this better and to be recognized and that was not there.
To find out where Leanne was when she was shot investigators analyzed the angle of the blood spatter on the computer stand next to Leigh Ann's body.
The size and shape of the blood spattered told investigators that the blood hit the computer stand at a ten to twenty degree angle.
Strings which were connected to each drop of blood spatter revealed the exact location of Leon's head when the shot was fired.
A friend says the angle you got was fifty two degrees so then you take the strain from the blood drop let in you measure up fifty two degrees and you bring that out to space somewhere in you that with each blood droplets.
Where the strings can't respect is the spot for the blood originated.
What first concluded that Leanne was on the floor when she was shot.
She was not sitting on the bed well sure shot that she was on her hands and her knees are shot.
Investigators also discovered fresh sperm in the vaginal swabs from Leigh Ann's autopsy an indication that the couple had sexual relations shortly before the shooting.
It'S my opinion that such relationships occurred.
Pretty close to the time of her death.
Police repeatedly test fired the gun in order to recreate the same as the billing patterns found on Leigh Ann's head.
They fired at close range and gradually moved back at six inch intervals.
The gun was twelve to eighteen inches away from Leigh Ann's head when the shot was fired too far away for me and to have held the gun herself which in essence takes out.
The possibility of this.
Leon'S family never believed the story that the shooting was accidental.
Judge your now ski said she was out of town on the day of Leigh Ann's death which checked out and investigators did not believe she knew about the mix plans.
Police arrested Mick Fletcher and charged him with the premeditated murder of his wife.
Prosecutors believe that the murder of Lee and Fletcher was premeditated and that her husband killed her in order to protect his romantic relationship with judge Susan sure now so.
Judge juror now ski testified that make had lied to her about his relationship with Leanne.
May told her he no longer was having sexual relations with his wife and so Susan sure now ski believed that the two had a future together.
But when Leanne became pregnant make realized that the judge would discover he had been lying I really do think if she would have gotten pregnant she still be alive.
I think that panicked him when she got pregnant you know.
Prosecutors believe the couple's trip to the firing range was probably a set up a way to explain why the pistol was out of its case in the bedroom.
They had to pick up their daughter before they picked up their daughter they want to come home and have a what he quoted as a quickie.
When they returned from the firing range and Lee and went into the bathroom.
The medical evidence shows that the couple had sex on the floor.
As Leanne was getting up make grabbed the gun and pulled the trigger.
The mistakes make made were numerous.
And he placed the weapon and slip on top of a blood stain next to Leigh Ann's bloody hand which clearly showed she hadn't been holding the gun.
Make then went into the bathroom and rinsed off Liam's black blood that was later found in the sink trap.
Then he called police.
You have the events of the night before where he is professing his love to another woman not his wife you had the blood in the trap of the sink which would indicate that he wants his hands prior to making a nine one one call you have the high velocity blood mist the cuff of his shirt you have the stippling patterns that are on the right side of Leanne space so the combination of all of this evidence suggests this pointed towards him as the person that committed this crime.
I didn't want to be a plan anymore but the thought of her being with somebody else.
Guilty of the lesser offense of second degree murder.
But the jury did not believe Mick Fletcher planned Leigh Ann's merger so he was convicted of second degree murder.
We are grateful that it was second degree but.
It should have been first degree initiative I mean it was clearly clearly premeditated and anybody that knew him knew that.
The trial judge sentenced lecture to the maximum penalty allowed life in prison.
In this exclusive phone interview from prison Fletcher tells the producers of this program that he is not a merger.
Unfortunately for him all the evidence points the other direction it's going to affect them indeed he did commit this parade to commit this crime.
It'S hard when you have two people in the house and only one left to tell the story.
And so you have to have the forensic evidence and that basically will tell the story for you.
I'M so glad.
You have to look at the scene and what is the scene tell you frantically and that's exactly what happened in this case that the story by the defendant and all my god my wife accidentally shot herself.
Was seen through I hope they find him in the same humiliating way my daughter half naked in the presence somewhere down.
And I hope he rots.
