No one was joking in Spokane Washington on April fools day nineteen ninety six.
First a bomb went off outside the office of a local newspaper then another inside a bank two armed men entered and robbed the bank of fifty thousand dollars it was apparently the work of well trained criminals but one of the bombers made a crucial mistake.
A simple pair of jeans he was wearing that day would later reveal his identity.
Nestled in the fault of the Spokane river the city of Spokane Washington is the cultural and economic center of an area known as the inland northwest which includes parts of Washington Idaho Montana and Oregon.
The region is known for its beautiful countryside and for being home to many right wing groups openly hostile to the government of the United States.
At two thirty six on the afternoon of April first nineteen ninety six one of these groups made its presence known in Spokane.
An employee at a branch office of the local newspaper the spokesman review.
Noticed a bomb with a lighted fuse just outside the building's rear door.
As he ran inside to call police the bomb explodes.
Shredding doors shattering windows and filling the building with smoke.
As employees fled the building police rushed to the scene they found extensive damage but no one was injured.
At two forty seven just eleven minutes after the spokesman review bombing police got another call.
There'S been another explosion this time inside the U. S. bank branch only thirty blocks away.
Bank surveillance camera showed two men entering the bank witnesses said a third man waited outside in a getaway van the man inside the bank for Parkers and ski masks to hide their identities.
They were heavily armed at gun point they ordered tellers to put money in bags.
After that occurred and they got apparently the money that they believed was available one of the robbers left a pipe bomb on the counter the bank and let it and then I told everybody to evacuate the bank that it I think the comment was made by one of the witnesses that they said get out it's going to blow or something similar to that.
The bomb scene in this surveillance shot exploded.
It tore through the building shattering windows counters indoors again amazingly no one was hurt.
Yes the teller had been standing there she could've been killed or severely injured.
and people inside the bank could been severely injured from the shrapnel as it flew.
Investigators were now connecting the two bombings.
Since the blast came so close together police were convinced the first bomb was a diversion designed to draw attention away from the bank robbery.
It was clearly a well planned and well executed crime.
These people really knew what they were doing and also there was no question when late they went inside that bank these were not amateurs they had planned this.
Later is left behind at both bombings left no doubt that they were related.
The letters which promised more violence had a symbol at the bottom.
Combination of the letter P. and the cross.
It was a symbol of the Phineas priesthood a highly armed extremely violent right wing terrorist group that had declared a holy war against the United States government.
Two bombings on the same day in Spokane Washington left massive damage and the community that feared there would be more violence to come.
As bomb experts dug through the rubble they found letters the bombers had purposely left behind.
Two experts on domestic terrorism the letters spoke volumes.
They contain symbols that identified the bombers as members of the Phineas priesthood.
The priesthoods creed is an unusual combination of biblical prophecy and violence a radical right wing view of America combined with the strictly conservative interpretation of scripture.
The result of fanatical hatred of government and the rationale for violence.
They want to destroy America do to save it they don't believe in reform in America they believe that the whole system is rotten and needs to be basically torn down so that we can start over again.
David knight were studied the Phineas priesthood for his book in god's country.
He says the group takes its name from an Old Testament story about a man named Phineas kills an interracial couple.
The essence of the Phineas priesthood is that.
People who violate god's laws deserve to be killed.
News that the priesthood had targeted Spokane terrified the city and had everyone including law enforcement preparing for the worst.
This was the most serious crime probably that's ever happened in Spokane from a danger to the entire community obviously you have serial murders and a lot of murder cases and so on but this case head you know people in fear they were terrorized.
Police now knew the name of the group but not the names of the bombers.
FBI analyst went over images from the bank surveillance cameras.
The images were shot once every second making for a disconnected sequence but when frozen and enlarged the individual images were extraordinarily clean.
Were some of the best that I've ever seen in the laboratory because they were high quality thirty five millimeter black and white photographs and the individual in question was standing so close to the camera that he filled a large part of the frame.
He used a process known as prospective analysis in which the tiles on the bank's floor.
Addition of the surveillance camera and the height of the teller counters were all used to measure the dimensions of everything in the image.
Analysts concluded the robber was approximately five feet six and a half inches tall.
This information was relayed to officers in Spokane.
But then on July twelfth just three months after the first attack there was another bomb.
This time the target was this Planned Parenthood clinic.
Witnesses said they saw two men in ponchos throw a lighted pipe bomb in the clinic's front door before driving away.
This particular one was covered with them buckshot to produce more shrapnel apparently in a in an effort to make it even more deadly or devastating then it it would normally have been.
The bomb tore through the clinic and was clearly designed to kill only luck kept it from claiming lives nobody was hurt it was.
Unbelievable there was nobody there had they then they would have been hurt.
People inside the Planned Parenthood there's no question somebody would've been killed is this bomb blew a hole in a four inch concrete floor.
Then just fifteen minutes later the same U. S. bank branch office robbed on April fools day was hit again almost a carbon copy of the first robbery and bombing after the bomb went off at a Planned Parenthood van pulls up again at the same U. S. bank on Sprague Avenue two robbers wrote though in one's carrying twenty five pound propane tank the kind that we use for our barbecues with something on top they're both armed as in the first robbery the man took over the bank and made off with thirty five thousand dollars in cash.
They left the propane tank bomb on the floor and fled in a white van but this mom which was rigged with an electric taser detonating device failed to go off.
A matchbook left behind at the Planned Parenthood bombing contained the priesthood logo it cited to biblical passages one psalm one thirty nine contains the verse killed the wicked.
A few days later the bombers sent this letter to Planned Parenthood it's sad sorry we missed you on July twelfth will do better next time.
After their branch office in Spokane Washington was targeted in two separate bomb attacks U. S. bank officials put up a one hundred thirty thousand dollar reward for any information on members of the Phineas priesthood the group that claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Meanwhile analysts examine the pipe bomb that nearly destroyed Spokane's Planned Parenthood clinic.
That bomb caused unbelievable damage to the Planned Parenthood the director Planned Parenthood from New York came out said this was the worst bombing that it ever happened a Planned Parenthood clinic.
The bomb was wrapped with buckshot.
This made it more deadly but also more identifiable.
Most buckshot is made from recycled car batteries which makes for a lot of impurities all of which can be identified.
FBI analyst Kathleen Monday took shavings from the buckshot found at the bomb site.
The shavings are dissolved in a neutral chemical solution.
This solution is then vaporized at extremely high temperatures the rate of vaporization is then fed to a computer which identifies the buckshot to basic chemical components.
Compared to my years of experience the buckshot in this case had extremely high levels of these impurities and the chemical or elemental makeup of this buckshot was I'd say distinctive compared to others that I've analyzed.
If this buckshot could be traced investigators might get a lead on the bombers identities.
But then a solid lead came from informants anxious to receive the reward.
One of the people that the.
Any S. Priester that this gang of people had tried to recruit into their gang decided that he wanted that money and contacted authorities and and pointed out the man to them.
The informant identified three men burn J. Morell Robert Barry and Charles Barkley all living in Sandpoint Idaho.
The informant had one more piece of information the trio was planning their next banquette for October eighth the target a U. S. bank branch in Portland Oregon.
The FBI immediately began background checks and surveillance on the three men.
They found that Morales fifty one trained as a nuclear engineer left his career and moved to Idaho to devote all his time to the Phineas priesthood.
Berry forty two owned a struggling truck repair shop and spent most of his time and money on anti government activities.
Barbie forty four had quit his job at A. T. and T. years earlier investigators suspected he might be the bomber in this surveillance image records indicated Barbie was five feet six and five eighths inches tall fractions away from analyst estimates of the bomber's actual height.
On October eighth the man who were being watched by investigators using long distance surveillance equipment look at their vehicle with automatic rifles and grenade launchers and left for Portland.
Before the trio arrived in Portland FBI officials called the U. S. bank branch and told them to lock their doors.
Agents watched as the trio waited outside the bank in their van.
They saw people going up to the doors checking the doors.
But nobody was getting and so that the bank got a phone call that said are you open and they said no.
We assume it was from a cell phone inside the vehicle.
Stymied in their plans the man drove away.
Agents followed them in the air and on the ground and when the man stopped for gas and Yakama Washington police swooped in for the arrest.
They would have been prepared for anything had we tried to stop them on the highway and they were gonna have a shoot out.
Somebody would have died.
There'S no doubt in my mind.
Agents searched the suspect's home.
Infirmary health home they found a Hewlett Packard inkjet color printer consistent with the one that printed the letter sent to the Planned Parenthood clinic.
In Robert Parry's truck repair business they found what appeared to be the same buckshot used in the Planned Parenthood bombing.
And in the home of the third suspect Charles Barkley investigators found something that the FBI analyst told them to be on the lookout for an unusual piece of evidence.
The plea worn pair of blue jeans.
After the arrest of three men in the Spokane bombings and robberies investigators look for conclusive evidence to tie them to the crimes.
The buckshot found in Robert Parry's truck repair business was subjected to the same analysis as buckshot attached to the bomb that destroyed Spokane's Planned Parenthood clinic.
Chemically I couldn't tell the buckshot recovered from the bombing apart from the buckshot recovered from the business they were chemically the same.
But prosecutors wanted something even more conclusive was there a way to use the bank surveillance images to clearly identify at least one of the robbers.
Was it possible that these two images which were particularly clear with the suspect Charles Barkley.
The robber was covered head to toe black is blue jeans were clearly identifiable.
Almost all blue jeans are made of white cotton that is then dyed blue how that blue dye wears off particularly on the scenes can be distinctive.
A sort of hill and valley effect is created hi parts of the scene turned white while the lower parts retain their color.
The fit of the jeans and the posture of the person wearing them can create unique patrons almost like a bar code that appears along these scenes.
FBI photograph analyst Richard border brew gate had an agent of Barbies hide where the genes taken from Charles Barbie's home.
This man was photographed from the same distance and in the same position as the bank's surveillance photo of the man thought to be Charles Barkley it enables me to get them positioned in a way that most closely approximates what the bank robbers posture was it also enables me to to try and replicate the draping of the clothing as closely as possible in a process called point by point analysis the photos are broken down into sections and each section is analyzed for distinctive features.
Then the two sets of photos those showing the jeans worn by the bank robber and those taken from the suspect's home.
The analysis showed more than thirty areas where the genes are identical near the number five it is clear the actual scheme of the jeans breaks and it's folded over.
This is clear in both sets of photos.
At number seven bridges can be seen extending above the hemline.
But at the point where the scene meets the hemline the jeans lose all their Connor and completely white this is also consistent in both photos.
Finally at the number two you can see where a line shooting off to the left above the hemline.
And at the ham a sort of H. pattern is created it's an H. with the broad right side and a thin left side.
The same age pattern can be seen in genes taken from Charles Bobby's home in this case because I was able to positively identify those pants I could get on the stand and say those pants were the ones worn by the bank robber I can't tell you who the bank robber was.
And so it's very strong circumstantial evidence Bobby couldn't have known it but the jeans he wore during the first bank robbery.
Help identify him and his fellow bombers in March of nineteen ninety seven the trio went on trial.
Over five hundred items were entered into evidence but the proceedings resulted in a mistrial.
It was later found that one of the jurors was sympathetic to the Phineas priesthood to anti government beliefs.
But at the second trial three months later the jury returned guilty verdicts and burn morale.
Charles Barbie and Robert berry were given mandatory life turns.
They claim to the end but the trial was political but investigators disagreed and to prove it they were able to present a well worn pair of blue jeans.
The same pair of blue jeans that were worn during the bank robbers.
I thought the lab didn't excellent job by being able to come up and compare those to the photograph and identify them positively has the genes to buy proper work and that's a only time I ever known to have been done it may have done so in other case someplace but I'm not aware of it I was pretty amazing.
They were basically robbers they wanted the money the criminals they didn't believe in our government that's true they didn't believe in abortion and that's true in believing banks that's true but the common criminals they did these two get money.
