Nine year old Valerie Jackson vanished from our Spokane Washington home without a trace.
The search for her whereabouts included almost every neighborhood and the area's mountain and forest regions.
But the key to solving the mystery was an investigative tool ten thousand miles away in space.
Spokane Washington is a vibrant city the center of an area known as the inland northwest.
Many residents looking to raise a family settle several miles east of the city in the Spokane valley where the schools are good crime is a low and families feel safe.
Brad Jackson a truck driver and his daughter Valerie lived here in the home they shared with Brad's parents.
Brad had sole custody of Valerie because the child's mother Roseanne pleasant mysteriously disappeared seven years ago she had a drug problem.
In October of nineteen ninety nine Valerie had just turned nine years old she was a very bright fourth grader at the McDonald elementary school just a few blocks from her home.
And fix it she was she was a great little girl never got in trouble.
Monday morning October eighteenth started out just like any other school day until something went terribly wrong.
Brad said Valerie had been playing in the backyard with their dog while he was in the basement doing laundry.
Later he heard Valerie leave for school through the garage door.
In any career go out in the front yard.
He was very exactly set exactly eight thirty two he walked out the front door and found her missing founder backpack laying on the front doorstep or.
Brad Jackson frantically searched the neighborhood knocking on doors searching for his daughter before calling police.
That call mobilize not just police but also a tightly knit neighborhood.
I got home at nine AM.
And my mother in law called me about five after and said there's a little red head girl missing on glossy and I knew right away it was Valerie so I raced over there Brad was in the front yard and I went over there and and hugged him and I said let's finder normally when we get missing kids I mean they're found either in the house or at a friend's house plane and they're they're cleared within.
Forty five minutes at the most two an hour but the little girl was nowhere to be found.
Valerie'S grandmother made a televised plea for her safe return please whoever took her for asking for her safe return.
As the search continued neighbors began calling police with leads.
Our little girl is kidnapped I might have something that might be able to help you okay yeah in the last couple weeks or a blue blazer and a man about sixty hello my colored hair.
Unfortunately none of these tips checked out.
Parents feared something sinister had invaded their quiet neighborhood.
We were all terrified we'd we wouldn't let our kids walk to school and we didn't want ours to be the next.
Days went by with no sign of nine year old Valerie Jackson.
Wires were posted in stores in car windows and on the internet newspapers and television stations asked the community to report anything suspicious as a parent you're concerned about child the same age.
Here there's potentially a person whose lives in the community preying on on school children.
An objection by a stranger was one possibility but problems in the Jackson family suggested another.
In fact it's her mother had been reported missing was listed as a missing person since nineteen ninety two and either her mother or someone for her mother could have taken out.
The last time anyone saw rows and pleasant Valerie's mother was seven years earlier in nineteen ninety two Roseanne's brother didn't believe his sister had anything to do with Valerie's disappearance he pointed the finger squarely at Brad we believe.
That he had sold one to put on a few ring to get money he was raising money for a reward so we felt that once the money got high enough that he would pay someone offer he had he had drug problems with it now.
Detectives searched a Jackson home for clues.
In Valerie's room for some blood stains on her pillow.
Brad Jackson told police that Valerie had a nose bleed the night before she disappeared.
Police also found a prescription for Valerie for the anti depressant Paxil.
They learned that the normally cheerful little girl was in counseling because of a stressful relationship with the natural order one of her father's girlfriend's.
The net and Valerie argued frequently and fought.
Do not suggested to Brad Valerie should receive therapy that was when she was given the anti depressant medication.
And forensic scientists found something else Valerie's.
Two red hairs.
They were identified as pubic hair and appeared to be similar to Brad Jackson's but the care can be transferred from room to room on socks.
The evidence could be meaningless or an indication of sexual abuse.
Police also thought it was odd that Brad Jackson was able to recall much more about Valerie's clothing on the day she disappeared than most parents would usually remember.
He knew exactly every article of clothing that Valerie Jackson was wearing he was able to describe it to the police down her purple socks.
And while Valerie did have a history of bloody noses there was no other evidence inside the home to corroborate Brad story.
I didn't find any evidence in the house other than on the pillow cases are for having a bloody nose no evidence for stopping the bloody nose such as toilet paper towels or anything they were laying around.
With the search warrant Jackson's pickup truck and automobile were searched for evidence.
But police found nothing in either vehicle.
Brother or sister two weeks after Valerie disappeared residents of the Spokane valley held a candlelight vigil praying for her safe return.
At this point that the girl's father was a suspect it made statements to me he knew is being followed by the news media there was neighbors following him all the time he was always having to lose tails he was very paranoid about it.
But surprisingly police weren't following Brad Jackson at all.
Because they didn't have to.
When police searched Jackson's car and truck for evidence they left something in the side of each vehicle.
It was a device called a global positioning system or GPS.
Ten thousand miles above the earth twenty eight global positioning satellites circle the glow each one beams back the precise time as Capt Bayern that Tomic clock.
Since the signals have different distances to travel and therefore reach the earth at different times a computerized receiver can translate that information into an exact position to within thirty feet the GPS receiver will record that location if we moved to another location it will know the difference in time and how long we have spent that time exactly two within milliseconds.
The location of the vehicle can then be monitored by the police.
After the GPS transmitters were hidden in Jackson's vehicles detective Madison took a calculated risk he confronted Jackson with his suspicion that he had murdered his own daughter.
I didn't know if the barrier I just took a gamble the fact we had found this is down over a week and the fact that she had been found at the time would indicate to me that she probably was underground he was kind of told by detective mats and that look we know you killed their.
We know you buried her somewhere you probably can bear deep enough animals are gonna finder again Deborah bones we're gonna find it and they'll look over your shoulder I'll be looking for him because you never know when the time is that I'm a stranger.
The satellites would be looking to.
And it didn't take long for Jackson to take the bait.
The GPS system revealed that Jackson had driven sixty miles away to a remote locking site and spent the next forty four minutes there.
Four days later Jackson drove five minutes away from his home to another deserted location on the car he wrote.
Two twenty eight twenty eight.
In the the next movement is two forty four ten.
Which is approximately fifteen minutes.
From there the GPS tracking system reveals Jackson drove sixty miles away stopping once again at the logging site there's some open fields farmland and a lot of woods.
When police went to the curry road site cadaver dogs went straight to a shallow grave empty except for two plastic shopping bags and some duct tape which had several red hairs attached.
Next police made the sixty mile drive to the logging site.
Once there the cadaver dogs found an area that had recently been excavated it was a grave deeper than the one on the Cauvery row.
And in that gray.
Was the body of nine year old Valerie Jackson.
Lying face down.
The police gamble had paid off they had frightened Jackson into moving Valerie's body into it deeper grave.
What'S your stor walked towards me.
He looked at me.
And I just crashed.
To the ground I went down I couldn't feel anything I confirm my legs my arms nothing.
I was gone I was mentally at that point in my life I died I died.
It hurts so much.
Investigators now had an avalanche of forensic evidence the plastic bags with the same brand as dozens found in Jackson's kitchen and traces of Valerie's blood were found inside.
The duct tape in the grave matched a role in Jackson's basement.
Jackson'S tire and footwear impressions were found at the gravesites.
All of this evidence tied Jackson to the burial.
But police still needed the Jackson was the one who committed the murder.
Police sent the plastic bags from the grave to the United States secret service for analysis they were using an extraordinary technique called vacuum metal deposition which confined the tiniest traces of a fingerprint on non porous surfaces like plastic.
We'Re here to assist any law enforcement agency state local or other federal agency you have a case of a child abduction or child homicide although we're extremely busy this kind of case it goes to finalize.
The evidence is placed in the chamber.
Along with tiny specks of gold and zinc.
The pressure in the chamber is reduced to a near perfect vacuum.
The metals are heated vaporized and within the vacuum of the chamber and here to any finger oils which may be present.
The analysis was successful.
The secret service found fingerprints on the inside of the plastic bag and on the duct tape.
The fingerprints were those Brad Jackson.
And Valerie Jackson's autopsy the medical examiners found no evidence of sexual abuse but discovered bruising around her face and knows which solve the mystery of how she was murdered the pillow that was found in her room had two blood spots on it which were consistent with a pole be impressed over someone's face in the blood draining from the nose there.
The question of motive was one that still haunted prosecutors.
The key issue and all this was why.
And convincing a jury that a parent could actually kill their their own child.
In a fascinating turn of events it was the global positioning satellite system which revealed the elusive most.
Almost a year after Valerie Jackson disappeared her father went on trial for murder.
Led to Valerie's grave by a GPS tracking system prosecutors were now able to piece together the events of Valerie's murder.
Prosecutors believe the Jackson smothered Valerie with the pillow leaving behind the blood stains found by police.
Then Jackson got the plastic bags and duct tape to cover her hand and prevent blood from dripping on to the floor.
Jackson dressed the little girl which is how he remembered what Valerie was wearing.
Jackson drove Valerie's body to the Bukhari road side just five minutes away an area he knew from hunting.
After he returned he called police to report his daughter missing.
A few weeks later while under the surveillance of the GPS system Jackson drove an hour away to a deserted logging site where he spent the next forty four minutes presumably digging a deeper grave.
Four days later Jackson went to the car he rode gravesite removed Valerie's body and made the one hour journey back to the logging site where he placed her in a deeper grave.
Why did Jackson killed his own daughter.
Astonishingly the Global Positioning System revealed the answer Jackson repeatedly drove by the home of his former girlfriend the net Schroeder as he went to and from the grave site.
Even though they had broken up brand continued to pursue her so he was really obsessed with this woman then the obsession got to the agree that.
his relationship with her was more important in his daughter's life.
I firmly believe that.
It got to the point where he saw that Valerie wasn't going to come around to connect he wanted to nap and Valerie became disposable.
The first thing Brad Jackson did after his arrest was too cold to knock from his jail cell and propose marriage.
The first thing she did was change the locks on her doors.
Prosecutor Jack Driscoll took the case personally.
As a parent who is supposed to protect their child is supposed to be in the guardian for them ends up coming face down in the dirt can you care.
And you know that offended me such a vast yeah I had to do this case may I had to.
Jackson have you received a copy of the information charging you with one count of murder and first degree Mr Jackson had those two charges one guilty.
But Jackson claimed Valerie's death was an accident but he found her dead of an overdose of Axel he feared that he would be blamed he panicked and buried the body.
But forensic scientists testified that the packs a levels and Valerie system we're no where near lethal.
Brad Jackson was found guilty of first degree murder.
And was sentenced to fifty six years in prison.
I believe you should face the death penalty but he didn't.
And I think anyone who murders a child.
Anyone the murders the child should face the death penalty and life should end I hope he never gets out of jail.
And she tells Roseanne has many people believe Jackson also killed Valerie's mother rose and pleasant years earlier but police have no proof.
She was scared to death of rats in my last conversation with my sister she said she feared for her life she said Brad had some life around and what is lye used for at that time Brad worked on scene at.
And building foundations.
And so to this day I believe that my sisters buried somewhere in those for one of those foundations he was working on.
The children of McDonald elementary school planted a tree in Valerie's memory it lives and grows they're healthy and strong.
The way Valerie should have.
