The surf and sand of central Florida make this a popular vacation spot but the area lost some of its luster in nineteen ninety five when a serial killer set up shop.
After the fourth body was discovered police knew an important detail the killer.
He had an unusual dog with an unusual drug habit.
Tampa Florida is known not only as a tourist destination but it also has more thunderstorms than any other location in the United States the name Tampa is derived from the Calusa native American word meaning lightning.
Along with the tourism there's prostitution.
On October twentieth nineteen ninety five a pizza delivery driver discovered the new body of a white woman in nearby Clearwater.
Forty two year old when the event was a crack cocaine addict recently released from a mental health clinic she was last seen hitchhiking an area frequented by prostitutes.
When the had been beaten and strangled but there were no signs of sexual assault.
The body had been dumped meaning she had been killed elsewhere.
Not surprisingly thunderstorm washed away possible evidence all the small artifacts that we would ordinarily hope to find someone with clothing on we were doubtful we were going to get too much so we were going to have to use anything and everything at our disposal from from microscopic examination to the use of light energy to try to luminous microscopic materials that our eyes could not see.
Investigators used a luma light to examine the body this device uses high intensity light higher than sunlight which causes man made fibers to glow or luminescence we felt it very important to use the light source a long life in this case because of its power T. search even though it was daytime and even though it was outdoors to do a search of that area in search of the victim's body for potential evidence.
The luma light revealed several tiny fibers on Wendy Evans is body which were taken to the lab for analysis.
The lumen light also revealed a few strands of dog care.
And about seven feet from where the body had been dumped was another potential clues.
Using dental plaster which hardens quickly into a flexible mold police made a cast of the impression which was photographed for analysis.
The trade patterns were clear meaning it was from a relatively new tire which had a small stone lodged in the tread.
Just one month later.
Police had another dump the body.
Two teenagers found the nude body of Peggy Darnell a forty year old Clearwater prostitute in the woods near a highway.
She had been dead for at least a week maybe longer.
Her body was decomposed to the point that no significant evidence was recovered.
Police believe the murders were committed by the same perpetrator and they quickly searched for other similar crimes in their cold case files.
They discovered another unsolved case.
Sixteen months earlier Madonna Jean stellar is noon and decomposed body was discovered in a vacant lot in downtown Clearwater.
The cause of death like the other cases was strangulation.
The Donna was a former model a waitress at a local sports bar and had previous arrests for prostitution.
She was a single mother of two children.
Police suspected they had a serial killer at work one that was one step ahead of their investigation.
In his mind he felt that he had denied us the physical evidence that would have tied him to a crime scene the bodies had been taken to remote areas they have been stripped of their clothing they've had been moved from the original crime scene all these things he had done to prevent us from catching him from finding evidence that would lead to help.
Investigators fearful the killer would strike again we're racing against time.
In the fall of nineteen ninety five police in Clearwater Florida had three murdered women their nude bodies dumped in deserted location.
With the passage of time between these three murders police knew they were dealing with the killer who lived in the area and not a tourist.
Serial killers tend to hunt for victims close to where they work or live.
Although the victims were kneeling the killer left behind some clues.
Scientists analyzed the fibers found on Wendy Evans is body.
Fibre specialist Jerry Sereno discovered that most were nylon but a few were made of polyester.
All were triangular or try local in shape.
And all were died with the same chemicals pink.
This positive news didn't come in time to save another life.
On January eighteenth nineteen ninety six there was a fourth victim.
Twenty seven year old Cindy Pugh who had recently moved to clear water from Maine was beaten strangled to death and her body dumped in an industrial area near a dumpster.
Again along the light was brought to the scene and again it revealed the pain fibers.
I can say that these fibers from the two different cases could have originated from or could have shared a common source.
I think after all the contaminations that I conducted that the fibers in these cases were very solid evidence.
Another unusual piece of evidence was what looked to be a piece of cigarettes.
I'M Cindy pues body the little piece of paper that was found on the breast of one of the victims if we would have got there maybe half an hour later it was ready to blow off it was barely sticking to the skin the cigarette paper contained saliva another to get a DNA profile.
What was the DNA from the killer.
The dog ears were sent to the FBI and identified as those of a.
The park is a toy sized dog with a very low tolerance to heat making them somewhat uncommon in states like Florida.
Investigators sent photographs of the tire impression found near Wendy Evans is body the Peter McDonald a forensic analyst who literally wrote the book on the identification of tire impressions.
He recognized the tire immediately I received the photographs and this was just amazing to me.
It was a tire that I designed when I was at Firestone we had no idea that he was the designer of the tire we were looking for so it that was just a very lucky break for us also.
Tyler was a Firestone radial ATX last manufactured in nineteen ninety two.
These were aftermarket replacement tires used on small pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
Police research sales records on how many of these tires were shipped and sold in far.
And they got a break.
The A. T. X. was not a best selling model.
And only one dealership in the entire state of Florida had sold the ATX tires in the last twelve months.
Tracks can be.
Bit of evidence at a crime scene.
One sec was purchased by a woman living in Clearwater just a few miles from where the bodies were discovered.
And she also owned a dog.
Florida investigators were on the hunt for a serial killer known to be driving a vehicle with Firestone radial ATX tires.
Police discovered that a woman living in the area Terry Joe Howard purchased a pair of Firestone radial ATX tires a few months before the murders began.
Terry Jones lived with the boyfriend forty one year old James Randall.
What does that have to run a dress at night and we had a detective sneak up on the vehicle and identified the tires on the vehicle is being the Firestone radial ATX tires.
It Peter McDonald said they were.
Terry Joe was a recovering drug addict and a former prostitute jeans Randall was a construction worker.
But she would walk in the neighborhood.
Local prostitutes identified Randall as a regular customer.
Police surveillance teams followed Randall for days and followed him into a car dealership driving the vehicle with the Firestone radial ATX tires.
Not wanting to give away anything the officer following stayed in the background in the dealer took the two tires off and replace them.
Then the detective called me all excited days.
We'Ve got the two rear tires.
But investigators needed all four tires to get a proper match.
So police devised a ruse.
Posing as an employee from the tire dealership a police detective told Randall that his new tires were defective.
But if he brought his car in right away he received four brand new tires for free as a gift for his inconvenience.
That same afternoon Terry Joe how're showed up in jeans Randall and gave her four brand new tires that the sheriff's office had purchased and the new tires placed on Randall's vehicle were marked.
We mark them in a certain way so that if those tires showed up at one of our crime scenes in the future we would know for sure that they were the tires from James Randall struck Peter macdonald studied the four original tires from Randall's vehicle.
The molding process creates marks in the site's marks that can distinguish one tire from another.
The sites from James Randall spire matched those from the crime scene photos.
And so did one of the distinguishing feature.
I found that the right rear tire as chance would have it was the best photograph Troyer and there was a stone that was held in the groove in exactly the same location that was recorded at the crime scene.
The stone being held in the tire.
Allowed for for positive identification.
But police wanted as much evidence as they could gather and they wanted to examine the hair of the dog owned by Terry Joe Howard.
Two female detectives knocked on Terry Jones door saying they had a new dog grooming service and offered to wash your dog free as a promotion.
Terry Joe accepted.
What do you.
Terry Joe Howard let the detectives in the house and they watched the dog and at that time they were able to pull dog hairs onto clean white tiles and.
Use them to compare the dog hairs from city views body.
Scientists discovered that the here from Terry Jones Pogba was microscopically similar to the pond hairs found on two of the victims.
A background check on James Randall revealed some startling information.
In violation of his parole Randall fled the state of Massachusetts after serving six years in prison for twice raping his first wife Jane Franke has been identified as a sexual sadist and that is a person who.
Has to inflict pain on a sexual partner in order to obtain sexual gratification for himself.
Terry Joe Howard described Randall the same way he got really mad.
And I sat down in the chair.
And he was yelling at me and he came over and he picked me up by my throat continue up against the wall.
That was the last thing I remember until I woke up on the bad.
And he was on top of me having intercourse with what I believe he thought was my dad.
Inside of their apartment police found more forensic evidence more proof that the murders were committed here.
I never felt so betrayed a mile life.
He was a master the master manipulator.
When they told me that they thought that Jimmy was the one who is killing all the girls in the area.
I was so shocked I just started screaming.
James Randall and Terry Joe Howard were living together during the time police suspected Randall was killing clear water prostitutes.
It was a clean good luck I don't think either one of us had ever.
Someone you care about you someone to go to the movies with.
Someone to chat with somebody watch TV with.
Armed with a search warrant investigators discovered.
Throw rug under the couple's bed.
Scientific tests found that the main portion of the rug was Nightline the French was polyester.
Fibers were triangular in shape and the die was the same as those on the victims.
Because the fibers had so many different characteristics that I could examine and compare.
That told me that either these victims came in contact with this particular road.
Four with the road that is composed of the exact same fibers as this particular road.
In searching Randall's home police found something unusual.
Small bits of cigarette paper scattered all over the floor.
Evidence that their dog.
Howard'S dog had a nicotine addiction and the dog would normally take cigarette butts out of the ashtrays and chew them up and spit them out and leave them on the floor of the apartment it was a smoker and would to you know tossed her cigarette butts and the dog would pick them up and chew on them and so they were least little flecks of cigarette paper all around.
Remember the cigarette papers found on Cindy pues body that contains saliva.
The DNA from that saliva belonged to Terry Joe Holland proof the cigarette paper had come from inside their apartment we believe that it was one small piece of a cigarette butt that the dog had chewed up and left behind that was attached to city views breast unbeknownst to James Franco which was a major major piece of physical evidence I believe some of these murders happened in my home and my dad I know some of two of the dead.
I was over here in west Palm.
Prosecutors believe that Randall would pick up victims and take them back to the apartment when Terry Joe was gone.
On the pink carpet Randall acted out his sadistic impulses strangling the women during sex and killing them.
While there the victims picked up carpet fibers and dog hairs later found on the bodies with the loan the light.
The cigarette paper chewed by the dog with Terry Jos DNA was found on Cindy Pugh.
Terry Joe confronted Randall about all of this when she went to see him in prison.
Why not me Jimmy.
And he looked at me and he started crying you don't want them to hear what he was stats tell me which was.
James Randall's first wife testified against him.
description of Randall sadism was chilling.
I'M at this point.
This site I don't know if I was going to make it out of there or not.
James Randall was convicted of the murder of Wendy and Evans and Cynthia Jean Pugh and was sentenced to two consecutive life terms.
Life in prison is not good enough speed.
