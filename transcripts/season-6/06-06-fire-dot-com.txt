In nineteen ninety six a fire broke out in a rental home in North Carolina.
One child died another was critically injured.
The family the fire was a mystery.
Investigators it was America.
Tabor city North Carolina small rolls sweet potato farming community in the western part of the state and home to the Hanson family.
This is Betty Joshua Hanson and his sister Britney lived with their mother Terri and her boyfriend Rodney Strickland.
Rodney worked in construction.
On October nineteenth nineteen ninety six Rodney left to spend the night with the sun in fair bluff about fifteen miles away.
Terry'S mother Bernice came over to the house that night for dinner I was there when she took Britney and Josh upstairs to bed.
And as it was going upstairs to bed the last words I heard Josh say is I love you.
Because he was just learning just how.
After Bernice left Terry plugged in a space heater to heat the home since it was the first cold night to fall.
She fell asleep on the sofa in the living room around midnight.
At four AM Terry was awakened by screams from our children.
The house was on fire.
Smoke and flames made it impossible to reach the children the only thing Terry could do was call the fire department.
The police arrived first and an officer also tried to rescue the children he too was unsuccessful.
To clear the way to remove the space heater at the bottom of the stairs.
By the time firemen arrive the up stairs was almost entirely in flames the children were rushed to the hospital both in critical condition.
She was black from head to toe.
Britney was fortunate she survived the fire.
Tragically seventeen month old Joshua did not.
When the fire was extinguished local authorities found evidence that the fire started in the children's bedroom closet.
At first they thought the Britney might have been playing with matches but when they looked into Terry Henson's background they uncovered information which made them suspect it might have been murdered.
In center now eight years old remembers the horrible fire that burned through her home four years earlier.
I have special because I had died and I came back a lot I think I'm special.
For younger brother Joshua just seventeen months old died in the fire.
With any kind of house fire officials tried to identify the calls.
Generally a fire burns longest at or near its point of origin so the room with the most damage is usually where the fire started.
Most of the damage was in Joshua's bedroom which was at the top of the stairs.
Investigators found a V. shaped pattern on the wall in Joshua's bedroom closet.
It'S a pattern that occurs when something combustible is against the wall.
This discovery told investigators that the fire started on the closet floor and traveled up to the attic.
A melted compara lexical wire was hanging from the attic which investigators concluded had been burned in the fire and was not because of it.
Special agents from the North Carolina state bureau of investigation and the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms assisted in the investigation they eliminated the nearby electrical outlet as the cause.
And when they couldn't determine how the fire started they concluded that someone had set it intentionally with a match or lighter.
I was told.
Anyone who had been in the house that evening what happened.
Investigators first talk to bridge to see if she had been playing with matches that night they were satisfied she had not.
Next they wanted to know where Terry's boyfriend Rodney was at the time of the fire.
Rodney had plenty of alibis he was back in fair bluff with his son but in the night all the people saw.
But investigators were most suspicious of Terry saying she was sleeping on the sofa downstairs when the fire broke out instead of in her bedroom upstairs.
And they also discovered that a few years earlier she had given three older children up for adoption.
The only reason Terry let those children though was because she did a lot of an active well the best form and at that time she could not give them anything not even a home.
She didn't have a job she didn't have a car she didn't have no money should have anything.
People made a leap from that event it options to somehow that becoming a motive for killing another child.
Witnesses also told police that at the fire scene Terry behaved suspiciously.
Anna and her boyfriend said that she would sleep on the couch it just didn't think Terry was acting the way a mother would act if there if a child had been killed in a fire was just something wrong to them about it.
Terry denied having anything to do with setting the fire.
I was actually the only one consider they had to eliminate Britain.
Twelve fifty miles away.
Police arrested Terry Hanson and charged her with murder attempted murder and arson.
And her nightmare continued when her own lawyer hired an independent investigator who agreed with the prosecution that the fire had been intentionally set.
But it took me a long time to realize what was going to help.
I still held a lot of faith he was going to do something and.
Terry could face the death penalty.
For sixty one days Terry Henson sat in a North Carolina jail cell waiting to be tried for murder and arson.
Eventually Terry was released on a two hundred thousand dollar bond but remained under house arrest and with no one else to turn to.
Terry conducted her own research into the fire that killed her son Joshua.
First with your computer she made a search on the internet she typed in the word fire.
I spent several days probably weeks.
Looking on the internet for a.
Something that would help my case I didn't understand the internet as far as there being actually people out there that you can talk to wasn't sure how to talk to him about it no.
It was slow going until Terry found an article written by a fire investigator in Sydney Australia.
Okay the article describes common mistakes investigators make when determining the cause of a suspicious fire.
Specifically discussed the role of bias in fire investigation.
For example arson investigators tend to look for arson and insurance investigators tend to look for insurance fraud.
The article recommends that fire investigators have a scientific or chemical background.
Terry desperately wanted to get in touch with the author I didn't understand email when I saw the little envelope thing on his page.
I clicked on it and it's you know like a blank page pops up read apartment so I just assumed okay well I can send this to him and I still don't understand how he would get back to me.
The author Toni K. did respond but since he lived in Australia he recommended doctor Gerald Hurst in Austin Texas Dr Hurst earned his PhD in chemistry from Cambridge and he agreed to look into Terry's case.
Homeowners burning house down to kill their children pretty rare.
Terry sent Dr Hurst every piece of information she had about the fire after reading through it Dr Hurst was struck by how incomplete the local investigation had been.
I decided to concentrate on the attic precisely because.
They have said almost nothing about the attic in the investigation.
The insulation in the attic was made of ground up newspaper treated with the flame retardant chemicals.
Dr Hurst check local weather conditions and he discovered that hurricane Fran had passed through Tabor city North Carolina just six weeks before the fire.
Terry said the torrential rains from that hurricane leaked through the roof and caused water damage in the ceilings.
Dr Hurst also found a melted fifty year old electrical wire in the attic insulation.
Terry told her is there in been some electrical problems on the night of the fire.
Curling iron had been going on and off earlier that evening.
And when she moved the electric space heater for the fireman she remembers it was cold to the touch that with both hands just slid out of work.
And lighters with at dawn on me that that here should have been very hot.
That meant that the heater had gone off the at least a half an hour.
Before she became aware of the fire.
Dr Hurst in fire investigator Ken Gibson flew to North Carolina to inspect Terry's home first hand.
They did not believe the fire started the way the government investigators said.
It'S really very simple innocent people are being put in prison.
Or forced into plea bargains for fires they did not start.
After Terry Hanson was charged with arson and murder in the death of a seventeen month old son Joshua.
Our only hope was a scientist she found through the internet.
Jerry first is one of these guys who kind of comes out of left field and actually save the day K..
The findings of the state bureau of investigation and the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms rested on the theory that the fire started on the floor of the bedroom closet.
And when the call is couldn't be found they concluded the fire had been deliberately set.
What you own is fire investigator.
To determine what caused the fire.
Dr Hurst found evidence that the roof leaked in Terry's rented home and tests revealed it washed away the flame retardant chemicals on the paper insulation.
He also found evidence of electrical malfunctioning on the day of the fire mysteriously Terry scrolling iron was going on and all.
And during the fire when Terry move the space heater it was cold to the touch.
This indicated the heater had not been on for at least a half hour before the fire the heater was plugged into a line originally designed for fifteen amps in the fuse box was a thirty amp fuse which had blown out.
That means that you're sharing more power through that wire than it was designed to carry.
And when you overloaded it heat gets hot.
Fifteen hundred water plants online that probably never seen at high wattage for.
And the question became did that electrical line over the top of the closet feed the heater.
You have a correlation the other.
And that is exactly what he found.
The cable in the attic fed the outlet used by the fifteen hundred what space heater and the curling iron.
That'S what really frosted the cake for us.
An origin there because it could not be disproven scientifically and we had a connection between the differences in what was done that night what had been done before that gives you a very strong presumptive case for an accidental fire Dr Hurst believes several factors created the chain of events that culminated with the fatal fire.
Water from the leaking roof wash the flame retardant chemicals off of the paper insulation in the attic and further eroded the fifty year old electrical cable.
Over time as the rain water hit the exposed portion of the electrical cable.
It are burning the wooden attic beam and leaving behind charm marks or carbon tracks.
Would does not conduct electricity but carbon dives.
Dr Hurst believes that when Terry plugged in the fifteen hundred watch space heater that night it heated the electrical wires in the attic which are.
Those sparks touch the carbon track which ignited the paper insulation just the Bob Joshua was bedroom closet.
I wouldn't say away with a an already well built fire that suddenly breaks through produces a Holocaust no time at all the fiery debris from the attic fell through the hole in the ceiling on to the floor of the closet and did not start on the floor and burned up words as local investigators suspected.
Can Gibson believes that the fire officials rush to judgment so anything that doesn't fall into the theory that that this was part of LRC started the fire to them it's not evidence it's just something that Sir.
Dr Hurst sent the local prosecutor his critique of the government's investigation which said their conclusions were based on junk science.
Is there a bad it melted and art buyer it had art marks on it which could have been caused by the fire.
But which could also have initiated the fire no way to tell and that wire pass.
Across dead center in the hole in the ceiling quite a coincidence.
To his credit the district attorney study Dr Hurst's report conducted his own investigation and dropped the charges against Terry Henson.
But by the time it was all over.
She had lost her home her child and nearly her freedom because of an inaccurate conclusion drawn from faulty science.
The fire investigation in general is the swamp of forensic science in fact many forensic scientist refused to recognize arson investigation as a sub field of forensic science I think Terry story in many respects is heroic she was not a very well educated women although she's extremely intelligent and she had just enough computer studies at a community college to know that if she was going to be under house arrest she needed some way where she could put herself out into the world even if it was only through her computer and email there's people sitting in prison that have gone through what I've gone through but they didn't have the help they don't know how to get it.
It had the money.
And that's not fair.
Terry Hanson cherishes her freedom and the time she spends with Britney.
Get Terry thinks of Joshua every day.
What he would have looked like.
What kind of person he'd be.
Remembering the good times.
