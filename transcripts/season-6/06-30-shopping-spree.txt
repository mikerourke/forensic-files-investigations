They were a beautiful family a striking raven haired couple with their delightful little girl.
In nineteen ninety five mother and daughter left home for a shopping trip and were never seen again.
The search for answers would lead investigators into a world of fantasy and perversion.
Peace and quiet.
That'S what attracts many to Limerick Pennsylvania a small town an hour's drive from Philadelphia.
People who live in Limerick say it's a wonderful place to raise a family.
Jimmy and Lisa man direct lift here with their nineteen month old daughter death.
Since Jimmy and Lisa both work full time weekends were an important time to relax have fun and enjoy one another.
On a Sunday afternoon in September of nineteen ninety five Lisa told her husband that she in Devon we're going shopping.
And she said she wouldn't be gone long.
Jamie stayed home watching football.
By dinnertime lease and the baby hadn't come home.
Jimmy said that his wife handed him the diaper bags I'll be right back in other words I will be long enough to need a diaper.
Finally and friends told police that the man directs were happily married.
Jimmy Lee said this relationship where one was not for an hour so they call each other than that I'm here I'm on my way we want to hear.
To see if Lisa may have run off with the baby police check to see if her luggage or toiletries were missing but they were not.
Jimmy told police his wife said she was going to a shopping center about ten miles from their home.
When police arrived they found Lisa's car in the parking lot there were no signs of foul play.
The grocery store was the only one still open and family members searched through the entire store and I said look up please page Lisa mandrax and cheating calling I knew right away something was wrong and I am I said this is my sister she's not in there.
Later that afternoon police received some terrible news.
Some hikers in nearby Valley Forge national park found the body of a baby girl.
They were walking along a trail at the base of an embankment the embankment was approximately fifty yards up to one of the access roads to the baby's body was between the top of the embankment at the road and the walking trail.
The child appeared to have been tossed from the road up by.
She was fully clothed but Bruce is clearly visible.
Jimmy man directs brother positively identified the body I consent to Canada because where's Lisa miles said it's at seven.
I was pretty much.
An autopsy revealed the Devon had been manually strangled to death.
But investigators found no forensic evidence on the body not a single clothing fiber or hair.
I have a seven month old daughter I can't even imagine I can't even come close to matching.
The news stunned family members and everyone in the little town of Limerick.
Well ordinarily young children are victims of the parent or the Parramore or something like that and it's a heat of passion thing or baby cried too much something like that I have to admit in this case I found it very unusual the Jimmy was not able to go win.
Look at his door.
And I admit that that intensified my suspicion that perhaps Jimmy was involved in Devin's death.
Despite the suspicions Jimmy man directed night any involvement with his daughter's death or his wife's disappearance.
As night fell police feared they would never find Lisa man direct alive.
Jimmy Manzarek said he was at home alone watching football on the day his daughter was murdered and his wife disappeared they were has everything to him I think that it would have been hard for him to wake up any day in the match and then not being there you know and when they weren't it it really is like literally ripped his heart out.
Jimmy said he gave Devin cooking and some pretzels before she left with Lisa but the store.
At first there were there was some question actually what we could do to verify his story when we found her car the cookie and the press arrival in the car it may not be of any scientific value in it helps verify the story.
And one of the neighbors said the Jimmy's car was at home all afternoon which confirmed his alibi.
Investigators look into other leads.
The fact that the cars parked there it leads us to believe that Devon and Lisa reached the parking lot where they abducted at that point did they go in with a doctor on the way out.
They learned that a local motorcycle gang met that day near the shopping center and wondered if Lisa and Devin might have had some sort of contact with the.
Jim these beautiful young wife would have been an easy target.
An intense search for Lisa began in Valley Forge national park the day after Devon's body was discovered there.
Helicopters bloodhounds and a cadaver dogs combed the thirty five hundred acre site no one should go through the day.
That my brother went through that day no I can't tell you what was life but I know what it's like to be with and I was all.
At the shopping center police asked employees and customers if they had seen anything suspicious the day before.
No one recalled seeing Devon Lisa or any members of the motorcycle gang.
There were two children stores at the shopping center.
Employees at any says did not recognize Lisa or Devin asked customers from the day before.
But a shopper at your kids and mine said.
She remembered seeing them inside that store around three thirty on Sunday she was paying for her items.
We were able to track down that transaction with the journal tape in the cash register in fact that was the last entry on the cash register journal tape for that day.
So we were able to say exactly what time that woman made her purchase and knew that definitely shows were alive in that store.
Your kids in mind was owned by a woman named Ruth fairly.
A twenty two year old son Caleb had been working alone in the store that Sunday.
Police contacted Caleb fairly by telephone.
He told them he hadn't seen anyone resembling Lisa and Devin in the store but he agreed to meet with detectives to look at photographs.
When he arrived at police headquarters investigators noticed that he was wearing make up I went and got a wet paper towel and asked him if he would wipe the makeup off his face.
Made my hair stand on end because you could see that they were perfect scratches from fingernails coming across his face.
Surely told police he'd been out marsh dancing the night before and that someone had accidentally scratched.
Martian dancing was a popular fat time which involved the crowd of dancers slamming into one another.
Investigators discovered that fairly had told friends something different.
Said all I had to break up a fight at work you know I I took the trash out the backing of a fight nearly had to break it up you know the three guys on one I had to break it up you know was certainly well you know that's kind of a chivalrous nice thing to do you know helping somebody out for trouble.
Background check revealed that Caleb fairly was a former high school choir boy with no past history of criminal violence but in nineteen ninety two he had been accused of sexual harassment.
There was a female jogging along the road.
Not next to her and then made.
Sharks are still some things that he would like to do to her friends described fairly as cute he lived with his parents was a loner and was fascinated with vampires is a very scary guy we ultimately serve a search warrant on his home and we found out that he was a real pervert and all kinds of strange sexual devices and various other perverted stuff.
He spent most of his time reading pornography and playing fantasy games like dungeons and dragons we have encountered numerous people.
The people in in in somewhat unusual murders like this were either devotees or tablets in the dungeons and dragons game there may be some connection between that type of role playing games that need to live in a fantasy world the reason we game is because we want to be a rock not everyone can be a fireman or policeman not everyone can be a soldier I don't want to be Indiana Jones so for the rest of us we read books we we play grants we have we date.
Friends say fairly would often dress up as a vampire in order to live out a fantasy depicted on one of his T. shirts vampire ravishing a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Lisa man Dirac he had a thing for women of a certain appearance in a number the game products that particular appearance is idealized had to do with very pale skin or very thin I'm quite often they have darker hair the fact that that particular physical stereotype was in vogue which opened all the artwork fairly denied any involvement in Devon's murder and Lisa's disappearance.
Was it possible that fairly had more to hide then scratches.
There were no signs of a struggle inside the clothing store where Lisa man direct was last seen.
But detectives did find some.
I shopper said she saw someone vacuuming in the store late Sunday afternoon just minutes before it closed.
And the local news crew reported seeing the same thing early the next morning.
In the stores vacuum cleaner police found several strands of long brunette hair which had been forcibly removed.
Without a body it was impossible to tell whether it was leases.
To analyze the carpet investigators used an ultraviolet light which causes certain substances like bodily fluids to Florence.
In the back part of the store the ultraviolet light revealed several suspicious stains.
And there were other stains nearby which turned out to be C..
A blood sample taken from Caleb fairly matched the semen found on the carpet the store.
Although this was certainly an unusual piece of evidence to find in a clothing store it wasn't proof of a sexual crime.
And police could find no physical evidence that police Amanda rack had been inside the store if you didn't find Lisa all we would have is a weird guy with scratches on his face who lives a little bit and you didn't have anything to tie him to the crime so finding her body was of utmost importance.
Police confronted fairly with the potentially incriminating evidence found in the store.
Early said he knew where Lisa wives and offer to lead police to her but only if prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty of Lisa was fought in murder.
The only mistake that he makes is agreeing to lead us to the body that turns out to be a mistake but at the time given the information that he had that was the right logical decision for he and his lawyer to make turns out they were wrong but their error was to our benefit.
Prosecutors accepted the terms and fairly led police to an industrial area near the store.
In an overgrown wooded lot next to the health club fairly belong to.
Police found Lisa's body in heavy brush.
Lisa was naked except for a black lace top pulled up around her neck.
The body was posed in a sexually suggestive position with her hair covering her face.
It'S not unusual to have someone try to cover the face of their victims almost as if they're trying to hide from the gauge of their dead victim.
And Lisa's hands showed signs of trauma.
Some of her fingernails were broken.
Others had been completely ripped off.
She was found in a sexually suggestive way he's a pervert that fits he's the last one to see them alive he has scratches on his face any lies about it that's enough to arrest it's a double homicide.
The society feel song he's the family need to answer.
The autopsy revealed that Lisa had been manually strangled.
Her body was badly bruised her ribs broken.
Tests also showed the police and they have been sexually assaulted.
They were microscopically similar to fibers from the short fairly was seen wearing on the day of the crime.
The hair found in the stores vacuum cleaner was compared to Lisa's hair and was also found to be microscopically similar.
Finally investigators subjected the biological material found under Lisa's fingernails to a DNA test any type of case you should look at the victim's fingernails and when two people have a physical contact.
Not transfer may leave the suspect's blood tissue in the victim's fingernail.
Tests revealed the skin under leases fingernails belonged to Caleb fairly.
Caleb fairly was arrested and charged with two counts of murder and aggravated assault theft and abuse of a corpse.
Prosecutors believe that barely lived in a fantasy world and the police a man direct matched his image of the perfect one.
When fairly song Lisa and realized that she and Devon with the only shoppers left in the store he locked the door.
The forensic evidence shows that fairly attack Lisa behind some high clothing racks out of street view.
But fairly underestimated Lisa strength she fought desperately for her life and that of her daughter scratching and clawing at the space.
During the struggle leases ribs were broken and her body tightly brews before she was strangled to death.
Saliva from the baby leapt on to the carpet fibers from fairly short were transferred on to Lisa's blouse.
There is evidence that fairly sexually assaulted her.
Nearly washed and vacuumed the carpet that night and again the next morning.
He carried the bodies out the back door.
He drove to Valley Forge national park and drop Devin's body there.
Then he drove to the industrial park where he allowed prickly posed leases body.
Fairly screen up attempts weren't able to hide the forensic evidence of the struggles and the biological evidence under leases fingernails.
Caleb fairly pled guilty to the charges but claimed the murders were not premeditated.
The jury didn't agree.
Takes a very long time to strangle somebody to death you have to be cut off the blood flow to the brain for four minutes that's a long time.
Fairly was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive life terms.
Evil people have evil fox so this fantasy woman walked into the store and his evilness drove him to commit these terrible crimes.
To this day.
The man direct family is still haunted by the cruel and senseless murders.
It doesn't doesn't make sense to me you can almost picture as to what occurred between Caleb and Lisa.
But Devin just Devon was less than two years old I like to buy him a weekend furlough given to my brother Jimmy.
And so I think.
The saliva hair and the DNA evidence told the story that Lisa and Devon man direct could not.
If we did not have the forensic evidence that we got from Lisa mandrax body Caleb fairly would almost certainly be walking around out there free right now.
I keep the mugshot photograph of Caleb fairly with those scratches across his face and white top destroy.
And it's just as a constant reminder of the evil to tell us what.
