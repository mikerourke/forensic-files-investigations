During the fall and winter of nineteen ninety one police searched all over New England for a woman who had disappeared from her home in Maine.
Police were not sure whether she had run away or it met with foul play.
One year later investigators found that.
A clue that had been right under their noses from the very beginning.
The largest city in the state and at one time it's capital.
It'S a deep water port on Casco Bay and in the to the Atlantic Ocean.
Which explains its role as a major fishing center.
Pearl Smith worked as a fish Packer.
Every day she box crates of fish for shipment around the country it was hard work with little pay.
After work she was a frequent customer at a bar near the docks she was a regular there.
As well as build bronze a man thirteen years her senior.
Bronze was a trucker his job was holding fish from Maine to Montreal.
The two had a lot in common they like to drink and they were unlucky in life.
All had been divorced five times and bills third marriage had just ended.
They fell in love and were married in the summer of nineteen eighty six.
Their relationship appeared to be close they met for lunch each day at this restaurant on the docks.
But on August thirteenth nineteen ninety one.
Pearl'S daughter called police to report her mother missing.
She said pearl failed to show up for a family gathering she had been looking forward to my mother was very loving very caring everybody's best friend.
Like I said she give her shirt off our back for anybody.
You know and she was always there when you need it or she never lets you down.
South Portland detective Linda Barker was assigned to the investigation.
At the bronze home she noticed that none of pearls clothing jewelry and personal items were missing.
And her prized possession a black Cadillac with vanity plates reading pearl B. was still in the garage.
Really loved her Cadillac and she very rarely went anywhere with it without it and that was one of the things that Elaine was very concerned about that her mother left but left a Cadillac behind the car being left behind in the garage said to me that my mother never left the home.
if my mother had left the home she would have been in the car.
So my daughter will Bruns told police that he and pearl had an argument and afterwards he left for Chinese food.
When he returned home.
Pearl was gone.
But he said he wasn't worried since she would occasionally leave with no explanation.
It was not unusual for parole to leave home four two three four even seven days at a time she would go and stay with friends in old orchard or or with family members so yeah it it had happened in the past it was not unusual.
With her car still in the garage.
How did she leave.
Police called the airlines bus and taxi services and there was no evidence that parole bronze had left town.
Bill bronze told police that his wife probably ran off with another man and the police chief agreed.
Chief sports did not believe that my mother was a missing person he believed that she was a drunk who may have possibly ran off with another man he knew my stepfather bill brown's personally and he believed that bill is not the type of person that would do anything to hurt anybody.
And he had made such a statement to Christine young the reporter at one time.
He said she was an alcoholic she been married six or seven times she probably ran off with one of our ex husbands so what about her current husband could he be involved this man I've known him for twenty years couldn't be him.
Days passed and then weeks and pearl Bruns family feared they would never see her again.
In the port city of Portland Maine police continue their search for forty eight year old pearl bronze.
Prosecutors were suspicious of pearls husband since he hadn't reported her missing.
Mr brown's behavior in this case was peculiar.
If you came home one day and found your wife.
Was gone without any explanation what what would what would you what would any of us to bronze did nothing.
It was pearl's daughter from a previous marriage who called police.
I knew that my mother would have been in contact with me so there was no doubt in my mind that my mother was no longer alive my mother was a type of person that would have gone to great lengths just to be able to contact me or my daughter.
Earl suitcase was found partially packed on her bed with high velocity impact blood spatter on it consistent with the striking a blow to the head.
The blood that was on the suitcase there was a high velocity blood spatter low velocity but also smears of blood on the suitcase indicating that the blood came either from cast off of some kind or possibly during the struggle somebody struck with the weapon of some kind in the days before her disappearance pearl brown spent an increasing amount of time in her favorite bar.
He told friends that she and bill were fighting mostly about money and that she was depressed.
Okay once news of pearl's disappearance hit the local media tips poured into the police.
One of pearl's friends said he thought he saw her walking along the docks late at night but none of the tips panned out.
The case stalled until six weeks later when a hiker on the Appalachian Trail two hundred miles away in New Hampshire found pearls bronzes purse.
But the pocketbook was found right near where the body of another murder woman had been found a year or two before that.
In the exact same area and that woman's murder to this day has never been solved all my mother's identification and everything was in the purse they describe jewelry to me and stuff that was in the purse that was definitely my mother's.
A search of the area uncovered nothing more but police now listed the case as a possible homicide.
I was thinking it might be possible that my mother's body was someone out there also it was laid there an open view of their personal belongings driver's license jewelry and money inside the pocket book with blood splatter on the outside of the box.
Somebody wanted us to find that box.
Meanwhile detective Barker went back to the Bronze home to question bill bronze further.
When she entered the bronze home she noticed something new.
I remarked to bill bronze G. bill you've got new carpet and he and he denied that he said I don't know this is this is the same carpet and I said will you you had the carpet cleaned and he said no no I did have a cleaned he said I just sprinkled it with this rug refreshing or and vacuumed it and I was really stand it because it was sparkling clean.
Neighbors said they saw bill brown struggling to get a carpet steam cleaner into his house.
Pearl'S daughter confronted her stepfather with her suspicions.
I sat down with bill one day at the kitchen table and I spoke with them and I told them you know bill you're the last one that saw my mother you're the only one that would know what happened to her and he just kind of sat there and looked at me and never said a word.
Police used cadaver dogs to search the bronze home the dogs are trained with the chemical formula called pseudo corpse which mimics the smell of decaying flesh.
Trained dogs will lie down when they detect the smell of the body.
When Dr Edward David let his dog rate through the home the dog headed immediately to the basement.
I could tell by the dog's attitude by that I mean the position of the tale of the E. years that the dog was sending and.
The dog then circled around the crawl space several times and then near the entrance to the crawl space the dog laid down.
Detectives began to excavate the area identified by the dog confident that the mystery of pearl bronze disappearance had finally been solved.
But to their astonishment.
They found nothing.
After months of searching for parole bronze the only clue to her disappearance was her purse found along a hiking trail two hundred miles away in New Hampshire.
A cadaver dog identified the scent of human remains and pearl bronze basement but the excavation turned up nothing a serious setback for investigators.
The investigation was frustrating destination because it was going on for so long at some point during these kinds of investigations you do reach a conclusion just based on common sense things aren't right this lady's dad and we've got to prove what happened and who did.
There was speculation that pearl's body may have been dumped at sea.
Or somewhere along the highway bill bronze traveled every week on his trucking route builder of refrigerated trucks he hauled fish from Maine to Canada in some of our minds we thought how perfect what a perfect way to get rid of a body got a refrigerated truck to stick it in Hollywood the fish has plenty of blood anyway but you got to remember to that with bills connections to fishermen on the dock and so on that Mrs brown's could have been taken out to sea and dumped overboard in somebody's fishing boat.
Bill bronze continued to maintain that his wife had run off with an ex husband.
But one of pearl's friends revealed information that contradicted that.
There'S one thing I want you to know she says if anything should ever happen to me you tell them that build it and I said are you talking about and then I just forgot about it.
So police got another warrant to search the bronze house this time they used a chemical reagent luminol.
When luminol is sprayed on an area where blood has been cleaned up with water and detergents it glows all the rest is.
Castoff blood spatter was evident on the walls and floor.
Bloody footprints leading towards the bathroom.
Areas of the rug and linoleum floor showed where large amounts of blood had been spilled and later cleaned up.
The steps leading down to the basement.
Each step indicated that a bloody object had been dragged down stairs at the bottom of the stairs some four feet across.
Most alarming was a blood stain found in a thirty eight by twenty five foot dirt crawl space.
On the dirt floor was the blood pattern of a human body the same height as pearl bronze.
It was clear that large amounts of blood had been spilled and cleaned inside the bronze home contradicting bill's story that his wife had simply left.
You'Ve been sitting here line build brands continued to maintain his innocence but when asked to take a lie detector test he refuses to.
Police were not sure what to do next they had already excavated the basement floor once and did come up empty handed.
For the next nine months the investigation stalls.
Until police learned of a new forensic tool one they hoped would lead them to World bronze body.
Despite three separate searches and a prior excavation of the bronze basement.
These were still convinced that the basement held the key to parole bronze disappearance we couldn't give up on the fact that there may be evidence down there but to dig this entire basement by hand was virtually impossible.
Detective Harriman then learned about a new forensic tool called ground penetrating radar.
He called Harding E. S. E. a local environmental engineering firm who had the equipment.
Thirteen months after Pearl bronze disappearance the bronze basement was searched with the radar.
They'Re gonna find certain but I'm also hoping that they will so that you know to be over with so we'll have some answers.
The technology is normally used to locate large metal objects buried in open fields the G. P. R. unit sends high frequency radio waves into the ground when the signals hit an obstruction of buried storage tank for instance the signal is reflected back up to the unit.
But looking for a body created problems.
Human body obviously made up of primarily water a fatty tissues flesh bone.
It in in my experiences especially with this particular survey is that the human body apparently did not conduct radio wave energy very well in the bronze basement the radar detected a consistent reflection just three feet below the surface a preliminary excavation revealed rust colored oxidized sand.
But there was another area that showed no reflection there was an area of white out on the record.
There was nothing to see.
Meaning that something absorb the energy what was we don't know until we dig it up and get a look at.
As bill bronze returned home from work investigators began to excavate his basement once more we dig just a few shovel falls on us at that point in time that I strike the plastic bag buried approximately two feet below the surface which turned out to be the head in case in a plastic bag.
It was a badly decomposed human body wrapped in two large garbage bags and tied with rope and tape.
The individual was wearing a wrist watch with pearl's name engraved on the face.
And had pink shoelaces like the ones pearl was last seen wearing.
The stench of decomposition was overwhelming.
And police walked up stairs to confront build bronze for the last time.
Ellis sitting up stairs in his home in the kitchen area is eating a plate of spaghetti for supper at around six o'clock in the evening we walk through the door advise bill you're under arrest bill for the murder of your wife hand the detective walks up to him and says bell come on we're going and this is why he says you're under arrest bail.
And brown says for what.
This is murder that's pretty strong word.
And pack can spell that's a pretty strong smell when they on earth the body you know you could smell the stench from miles and he's up stairs in the house eating spaghetti and when they come up to arrest them he asked if he could finish his dinner before they took him away.
So it just kind of shows you know what a sick individual he was.
Bill bronze was arrested and charged with murder.
X. rays showed three fractures to the left side of pearl's face but the skin was not an indication that pearl was struck with the fist.
Securus believe that on August eleventh building pro argued about money and the fight became physical.
He struck her three times with enough force that the castoff blood spatter landed on pearl suitcase on the wall and on the floor.
As she lay on the floor.
Pearl bled to death.
Bill then packed the body into plastic bags and carried her to the base.
The luminol revealed the path clearly and shows where her body lay as he dug the grave.
The cadaver dog was correct about the body in the basement and the location he identified was only a few feet away from the actual burial spot.
Police believe that in an attempt to throw off the investigation.
Bill bronze took pearls purse and left it two hundred miles away on a hiking trail in New Hampshire.
Bill bronze pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison.
Without developments in forensic science such as luminol ground penetrating radar which were used to great effect in this case I think it is highly likely that build brands would have gotten away with murder.
Ironically during the autopsy on pearl bronze body.
I thought I just found that she had terminal cancer and would have lived only another six months.
If he had just been patient my mother would have died of natural causes anyway and he wouldn't be sitting in jail now and I just see it as my mother getting the last laugh on him because like I said if he had just been patient she would have died on our own.
