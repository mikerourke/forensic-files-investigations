In nineteen ninety two two masked gunmen broke into this home on the Thailand Dega Mohawk territory in Canada.
The motive was robbery but there was a struggle shots were fired.
Fifty four year old war Markle critically injured.
It took solid police investigation and some fancy footwork to identify the perpetrators.
The tie and a nigga Mohawk territory is a small community about two hours east of Toronto Canada.
The territory was founded over two hundred years ago when the Mohawk moved here from upstate New York.
The homes and landscape of the area are no different from any other north American community the sense of family among the Mohawk is especially strong.
It doesn't appear to be any different than anywhere else in Canada or the US in what I would call for lack of a better term mainstream culture but like I say the differences is in the people in this community it's it's there's a lot of blood family but even if you're not related you know everybody pretty close so it it's like being family.
Morgan Diane Americal were respected members of the community.
Ward'S gas bar America's business a gas station with the restaurant attached had always been a prosperous business.
Night they also operated a check cashing service from their home for people who didn't have an ATM card.
Everybody knows ward and Diane the business there as well have contact with them.
They'Re good people.
At Christmas time residents of the reserves celebrate the holiday just like any other community.
With Santa Claus Christmas lights.
But in the early morning hours of December thirtieth nineteen ninety two the holiday spirit of the community were shattered.
Just before dawn two masked gunmen broke into the miracles home.
They went upstairs Morton Diana and demanded money.
Where is the money given the money one was holding a twenty two caliber pistol the other piece of wood.
By the time it was over ward had been shot three times.
The second perpetrator took Diana downstairs.
Fearing for her life Diana handed over the money they had on hand ten thousand dollars in cash.
We'Ve got a shooting down here on the return.
Mericle was rushed to the hospital with a bullet wound to his head he underwent emergency surgery.
Since the gunman wore masks all Diana could tell police that the assailants made their get away in a red car.
A few miles down the road.
Respond to two masks used in the robbery one was a little ski mask the other a rubber Halloween mask.
Inside the miracles home.
East found three shell casings which were collected for analysis.
The Callaway in this case I believe twenty two short caliber the fact they're out on the ground would indicate that more than likely a semi automatic pistol as opposed to a revolver was used.
Since the stairs had no carpet and with snow outside.
Investigators suspected that the perpetrators wet feet might have left latent shoe impressions on the stairs.
The stairs were dusted with fingerprint powder and immediately.
Your impression of a running shoe was evident.
Sign the house forensic experts found trail of evidence in the snow.
Which they hoped would lead them to the perpetrators.
During the Christmas holidays in nineteen ninety two residents of the tie in to make a Mohawk territory learned the terrible news that one of their most prominent citizens ward Marichal had been the victims of this senseless shooting.
There is very little violent crime in the small community of twenty six hundred people.
That'S something of this magnitude could happen in a community such as this.
Ward Marichal was shot three times by a twenty two caliber pistol one of the bullets entered his head.
But he was fortunate to survive but the injury would leave him permanently disabled.
Forensic scientist Jim ET inspected the crime scene.
He noticed a piece of wood on the kitchen table.
Diane Americal told police one of the perpetrators held the wood in his hand during the robbery.
When he walked outside on the side of the house he found a wooden saw horse with one of the legs missing.
It appeared that the perpetrators took the lead from the sawhorse and used it to break through the front door.
Next to the source clearly visible in the bright December sunshine was a foot print in the snow.
And when I looked I could see footprints in the area of the sawhorse I was certain that somebody had gone back behind the house and got the summers and ripped a leg off.
There was a potential piece of very important evidence.
Jim ET realized he had to act quickly before the snow melted and before anyone else walked through the crime scene.
His first order of business was to photograph the footprints the stills with the important especially if he was unable to make a cast of the footprint.
He then rushed to his truck and look for materials to make a mold.
There are a number of techniques for capturing the footprint impression in the snow if you choose the wrong one the impression could be lost forever.
So presents interesting problems because if you use conventional casting materials such as dental plaster it's really very heavy dental plasters is hardens to stone and if you poured into snow it tends to collapse the foot print because of the weight.
Detective Didi decided on the technique called sulphur casting.
He took a small burner in the pocket and he did the powdered sulphur.
It takes about fifteen minutes before it melts into a thick brown liquid.
Stan cool to the point of crystallization.
As it poured into the snow the sulfur re crystallizes immediately and hardens retaining the important details needed for identification.
The impression was from a pair of Nike air sneakers size eight.
The issue was relatively new with very little wear.
In the impression with some important clues about the perpetrators details called accidental characteristics.
The part of the shoe that's going to be rubbing against the road and against the sidewalk and that has those accidental characteristics that we're going to be looking for.
In an accidental characteristic is not just a little point oftentimes it's like a mini piece of art.
ET noticed three small cuts all in a row on the soul as if the wearer had stepped on a small piece of wire.
In all the media identified ten accidental characteristics in the shoe impressions.
These would distinguish this particular shoe from the thousands of other Nike air size eight running shoes that were in circulation.
Not surprisingly the shoe impression in the snow matched the shoe print on the wooden steps inside the home.
We'Ve recovered some very good evidence we have to print.
We have brass casings the difficulty is unlike fingerprints which can be searched on a computer and identified in the case of bullet casings or shoe prints you need a suspect.
But finding the suspect would not be easy.
The robbery and shooting of ward miracle on the tie in the Niagara Mohawk reserve was widely covered by the media in the surrounding areas.
Two days after the shooting an anonymous telephone call suggested police look into the whereabouts of Peter Benedict and Franklin New in the early morning hours of December thirteenth.
Both men were twenty one years old both had criminal records.
Benedict lived in Cornwall which is about an hour's drive from the reserve police had no fixed address for Lenovo.
Police went to Peter Benedict's apartment armed with a search warrant.
Police noticed a red car similar to the one Diane Americal identified as the get away car.
Peter Benedict denied any involvement in the crime and said he didn't know where Franklin no wise.
Inside Benedict's apartment police found a twenty two caliber pistols the same caliber used in the shooting.
They also found a number of pairs of running shoes but none with the Nike air model size eight like the impressions found at the crime scene.
Police also found twenty five hundred dollars in cash and Benedict was wearing what looked to be a very expensive ring.
In Benedict's bedroom police found a receipt for the ring.
It was purchased on December thirty first just hours after the robbery at the Merrick calls home the rain was purchased with eleven hundred dollars in cash from a jewelry store in Ottawa.
we went out to the car and search the vehicle after that and in the trunk I found an Aldo shoe box so I thinking about all the shoe box brand running shoes brand ring I'm going to Iowa because there has to be a story to be told in Ottawa and I wanted to hear the story.
Once he got to the mall Rick Myers discovered that there were a number of shoe stores in the mall.
He patiently visited each one asking store employees if they recognize Benedict or the new as a recent customer.
I think in a couple days ago actually the store clerk recognized Peter Benedict from the mug shot there was.
He said Benedict bought a pair of running shoes just a few days earlier.
And he recalled that Benedict wore the new shoes out of the store and left his old pair behind.
Just simply gave up the old ones for garbage and just wore his new ones home.
I asked if he would check to see if the old ones are still around he told me that no the garbage is gonna have Friday.
I was insistent that he go in and re check because it's always good to check everything's particularly so close in this type of investigation getting something that you really want.
Fortunately for investigators the trash hadn't been removed from the back room.
And in the trash bin the clerk found the sneakers Benedict left behind.
He did and sure enough he comes back dangling the shoes and a very nice smile on his face and it was a big one of mine.
They were size eight Nike air charcoal high top basketball shoes but were they the ones worn to the crime scene.
When Jim eighty analyzed the shoes from the trash bin he discovered the shoe had ten accidental characteristics which were in the same location the same shape and size as those found on the shoe impression in the snow and on the steps.
Investigators now knew that Peter Benedict took part in the robbery.
Okay but was he the shooter and where was Franklin New.
Identify who pulled the trigger.
Within a week of the robbery and shooting aboard Mericle on the tie in the Niagara Mohawk reserve in Canada police have two suspects Peter Benedict and Franklin Peter Benedict was already in custody and Franklin who voluntarily came in to police headquarters for questioning.
Both denied any involvement in the crime.
But the evidence against Peter Benedict was mounting quickly.
The shoes he left at the shoe store were positively identified as issues which left the print on the miracle stairway and in the snow print outside their home.
Next Benedict's twenty two caliber gun was tested by ballistics.
this personal here the Beretta model nine fifty B. it's a semi automatic pistol twenty two short caliber which is really the shorter the smaller stir caliber that used in handguns it doesn't look like much it said just twenty two they'll kill you just listed the bigger calibers will.
The bullets recovered from ward miracle in the operating room were too badly damaged for forensic analysis.
So investigators used the spent shell casings found in America's home for comparison.
Benedict'S gun was test fired in the ballistics laboratory.
The act of pulling the trigger causes the firing pin to strike the primer which ignites propelling the bullet from the barrel.
Simultaneously the spent shell casing is pushed back with full force.
Just as the ball that is marked by its passage through the barrel so is the shell as it comes into contact with the metal surfaces of the weapons firing and loading mechanisms.
Firing pin impressions are as unique as a fingerprint.
The firing pin impressions on the shell casings test fired from Benedict's gone were identical to the impressions on the three shell casings found inside the merit close home.
It'S still you're looking at in your training and your experience that causes you to reach a conclusion and in this case Sir what I saw and my previous as a solely trained indicated to us yes those countries were fired in that gun and other.
The money found in Peter Benedict's apartment had numbers written by hand on the bonds they matched Diane America's handwriting.
Not surprisingly inside Benedict's car on the driver's side Peter Benedict's fingerprints.
But on the passenger's side with Franklin knows.
The last challenge for investigators was to discover which one of these two suspects was the shooter.
Diana Mericle said the gunman was wearing the wool ski mask the man in the rubber amassed held the piece of wood.
Scientists were able to identify traces of saliva and mucus inside Damascus and from that they were able to generate a DNA profile of the individuals who wore each mask.
When police compared the DNA of Franklin New and Peter Benedict they discovered that Benedict's DNA was inside the rubber mask and the Franklin news DNA was inside the wall mask.
This identified Franklin as the shooter.
When Peter Benedict in Franklin learned about the overwhelming forensic evidence against them they both pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and robbery.
They were each sentenced to six years in prison.
Marichal eventually recovered from his injuries after a long and difficult rehabilitation.
Published reports say he still has lingering problems resulting from the head injury.
Ian Diana still live and work on the Mohawk reserve.
To this day warden Diane Americal refused to talk about what happened in the early morning hours of December thirtieth nineteen ninety two.
It was a great case it was a classic.
One of four the many highlights of my career I've I enjoyed that case so very exciting day for me when I saw those running shoes come come waltzing out from behind the.
The back room I believe that the shoe print evidence that we're working with is very strong evidence and it was very strong evidence the preliminary hearing and.
And I think.
