Just ninety miles north of New York City a female correctional officer was discovered missing from our post at the prison.
There was no trace of her anywhere inside the prison none of the inmates or guards knew where she went a reported seeing anything suspicious.
How could a guard simply disappear in an overcrowded maximum security prison.
Greenhaven state correctional facility one of the toughest maximum security prisons in the United States.
A violent overcrowded space that is home to eighteen hundred New York state's most violent criminals.
Greenhaven how was I think at that time had to be considered our supermax prisons state and everybody in there had a long time everybody in there was a vicious criminal there were no newcomers it was a pretty pretty bad place as far as population is concerned.
More than five hundred prisoners inside green haven were convicted murderers.
Nineteen eighty one was the first year female correctional officers worked in this all male maximum security prison there were fifty on staff all new to the job.
One of the thirty one year old Donna pay on.
I want to describe Donna and and her personality would describe her as a very strong willed independent determined person and with a strong sense of justice Donna had three children her husband was also a corrections officer but work at another prison.
Although her family came to accept her job choice some of the men working inside the prison establishment did not.
While at the training academy an instructor entered Donna's room that night uninvited Donna responded by filing a sexual harassment lawsuit but later on the battery and dropped the suit.
On may fifteenth nineteen eighty one Donna punched in just after noon for the one to nine.
About an hour later Donna was with two other officers when the.
It was a call for don.
Donna panth received a telephone call.
In the early afternoon of that Friday.
And it was a strange call and in the opinion of her co officers who were working with her her reaction after receiving the call was somewhat alarming the other officers didn't know who placed the call but they said that Donna turned away from them to keep our conversation private.
And she hung up she laughs not saying where she was going.
Donna panth was upset.
Not upset in the in the sense that she was nervous but she was angered her words were on putting an end to this it's going to end right here in Dallas something to that effect and then she storms off five hours later at the regular evening roll call for officers Donna P. on was absent.
Prison officials immediately ordered an emergency lockdown.
Hold prisoners were confined to their cells officers home the prison going through all the cell blocks offices and recreation areas but there was no trace of Donna pay Oct.
That'S a maximum security prison so they had pretty good control of who left and entered there was no indication that she left.
As dawn broke the next day.
Prison officials received some terrible news in a nearby landfills all of the prison trash was taken each day workers found the badly mutilated body of a blonde woman in a prison guard uniform.
The body had been wrapped in a garbage bag.
The day after Donna pay on disappeared.
Emily was called the green haven prison.
There were officials there and they met us and I knew then they didn't say so but I knew something was wrong.
So we walked in and they told us you know she was dead and and that they have founder you know I don't.
The body in the landfill was positively identified as Donna pay on.
She became the first female corrections officer to die in the line of duty in U. S. history.
She was found with ligatures around her wrists and neck.
The cause of death was strangulation.
There were also signs that she had been sexually assaulted.
My father was very very upset and he never got over it.
The body had gone through the trash compactor the garbage truck this told investigators that the body had been placed in a prison garbage can where it was emptied into the trash truck that service the president.
And at the landfill the body had been run over by a bulldozer which levels the garbage into a flat surface every bone in her body had been broken she was covered with all sorts of debris and garbage filth and wetness because it was a very very wet dump and any.
Evidence that would have been available had to have been contaminated by all of this extraneous materials that will cover her body.
Donna pay on some body had left green haven along with the prisons trash.
Killer had to be someone inside the prison with more access than prisoners customarily have.
But who inside the prison would want her dad.
Readymades harassing her was she disciplinarian who came down hard on any inmates was there any reason why they would want to attack her.
In addition to access an inmate would have needed privacy to commit the murder.
Since prison guards would have this kind of freedom of movement they became the focus of the investigation.
Just three days before her death witnesses saw a male guard involved in a heated physical confrontation with Donna pay on.
He was seen as she turned away from that heated discussion he was seen poking her on her shoulder on her back he was very upset.
I understand it was soon discovered this guard was among many at green haven who had something to hide.
People had motives to kill Donna inside prison I believe that because of all the illegal activities that were going on in green haven at the time of her death and long before that that there were people there that not only did they have the motive they had the capability to carry out such a crime those activities have been revealed in official report released just two weeks before Donna pay on smarter.
The green haven guards were suspected of having a let's make a deal latitude with the prisoners guards were selling drugs and even providing prostitutes to inmates.
A good old boy network had kept this secret for years but some of the new female recruits like Donna pay on wanted no part of that network.
And when Donna P. on had made the earlier charge of sexual harassment she quickly became known as a whistle blower she was already marked as a person that that would.
say something if something was wrong or if there were illegal activities going on and that that she was marked as a person that would go as far up as possible and report it.
During an autopsy on Donna pay on.
The medical examiner discovered she was not only sexually assaulted with extreme savagery he also found what appeared to be bite marks.
Wesson shape the wound on her chest was particularly clear couple of the teeth marks obviously it's sunk in much deeper than than others and you could tell it was the cheeses are remember where.
Perhaps the best chief in the world they weren't they weren't perfectly shaped it seemed to me.
The bite mark ligature marks strangulation and the brutality of the sexual assault all indicated that this killer had murdered before it was not his first crime.
But who had this kind of homicidal history.
And who at green haven was so angry with Donna pay on that they would not only want her dad would kill her in such a brutal way.
The day after her death Donna pay ons body was found here in the in the new dump about thirty miles from the prison news of Donna P. on murder soon made its way throughout the state of New York.
The bite mark impression on Donna pay ons body was photographed and sent to a forensic odontology just Dr Lowell Levine when Dr Levine studies the impression he was immediately convinced of two things first he was certain the mark was a bite impression second doctor Levine knew he had seen the same bite impression before.
Is that what you do but I just saw this two or three days ago in a lecture they give in on the case but I've seen four years ago in Schenectady New York.
It was a case of a thirty year old woman named Mary Lee Wilson within strangled with a ligature brutally sexually assaulted and.
Dr Levine immediately asked the logical question was merrily Wilson's killer an inmate at the prison where Donna pay on work.
Said wait a minute you know Lemuel Smith is going to be in prison and have access to this lady.
The answer was.
Yes thirty nine year old Lemuel Smith was in green haven state correctional facility he had confessed to the murders of merrily Wilson and another one.
Both victims had been killed in the same way.
All right signature killings.
But in the four years in prison Lemuel Smith had been a model prisoner.
On religion it was an altar boy and rose to become the assistant to the Catholic chaplain.
This new position granted Smith Norma's freedom inside the prison freedom most of the inmates didn't have.
I know you've never tried it about twice as much as you.
But prison officials found evidence that Smith had some prior contact with don the pay on time and that the two developed a friendship.
Donna panth had made some contact with Lemuel Smith concerning an item I believe was a jewelry box that she was looking to have made Lemuel Smith while in prison was doing some wood carvings on occasion.
In Lemuel Smith's prison file investigators found a report from doctor its feet cloak popped a psychiatrist who evaluated Smith four years earlier after I interviewed him he said to me listen one thing I want you to do is I'm much to make sure that I never get out.
Because I'm going to do this again because I can't stop it.
Dr cloak diagnosed manual as a paranoid schizophrenic with a borderline personality he warned officials that without psychiatric care Smith was sure to kill again.
That warning was ignored when Smith was granted extra freedoms by virtue of this pastoral duties.
So he had the entire off several options to himself with the telephones in that office and he had the he was the only person who were really could use the office.
When investigators searched the chaplain's office it seemed to be in perfect order.
A closer examination revealed the room had just been cleaned.
Reporter washed down with not so clean water but it's pretty obvious who were there there that that had been done and done recently.
In an office closet investigators found several blonde hairs those were found to be microscopically consistent with Donna pay ons hair.
The only other evidence was the white impression found on Donna's chess during the autopsy.
Because of the damage to Donna's body by the garbage compactor and a bulldozer some believed it wasn't quite that all.
And as evidence it was essentially worthless.
Somewhere within the walls of green haven state correctional facility lurked the killer of prison guard Donna pay on.
A number of inmates told officials that the male prison guard who was seen fighting with Donna three days before her death was the one responsible.
When the guard was questioned about Donna's murder he admitted he was selling cocaine to prisoners but he also said he had nothing to do with Donna smarter.
The other suspect was a prisoner named Lemuel Smith.
However killed Donna had bitten her leaving a highly distinctive bite impression on her chest.
The bite wound was produced by someone's bottom teeth by someone who was missing one of his four bottom incisors.
Lemuel Smith was messing up bottom incisor.
The space can be measured as can the spaces between the other.
The picture on top is a bite marks found on merrily Wilson's body the woman Smith admitted killing in the middle lane you will Smith's bright pattern imprinted on wax.
And on the bottom.
Is the bite marks found on Donna pay on spot.
When compared to the space between the lower right incisors is clearly visible.
In all three cases the measurements and angles of the teeth are exactly the same.
But if Lemuel Smith killed on the pay on how did he do it.
It was following exactly the same pattern as the previous murders he had involved himself with her he believed apparently that she was someone who was interested in him he saw was a close friend of someone who really cared about him he made a gift so it follows the exact same patterns before.
The keys a psychiatrist was the jewelry box Lemuel Smith had made as a gift for Donna pay on.
Police theorized that the phone call she received just before her death was from Lemuel Smith calling from the privacy of the chaplain's office.
A personal call from an inmate would have been an embarrassment for a rookie guard like Donna pay off I can't tell.
Other guards said Donna seemed upset after the call and left abruptly.
Once again the chaplain's office the two may have argued.
Or Donna may have rejected him for his skin.
This sat off the same homicidal fury that had left two other women date.
Then he sexually assaulted her strangled her and at some point.
The chaplain was away that day and Smith would have had enough privacy to commit murder wrap the body in trash bags and then clean the room.
The clean up was well done except for the areas that were inadvertently swept into the class.
Smith also had enough prison access to get the body to the trash dumpster without being noticed.
In January of nineteen eighty three Lemuel Smith was convicted of Donna pay ons murder and now spans twenty three hours a day in solitary confinement.
Lemuel Smith continues to deny he was involved insisting he was framed by prison guards.
Are not politically correct I'm.
Right I got a bad rap.
Right nobody wants to say anything good about right because that's going against the system and only these experts in my opinion.
Right and this is this on this case.
As for the bite mark.
Lanes it was an injury caused by the trash compactor in bulldozer at the landfill and that those involved in the alleged cover up doctor did to make it look like his bike.
You could see that there's a match you just saying that the matches fabric I can see anyone can see.
That claim is backed up by Donna pay on sister G. two is convinced that prison guards murdered her sister then covered it up.
They still do not believe that an inmate would help pick out CO two killed in a maximum security prison in the middle of the present in the middle of the day I don't believe that and it's not possible it hasn't happened before and hasn't happened since.
For investigators however there is no question.
M. you will Smith had the means and the opportunity to kill Donna pay on a fact they say is backed up by the bite mark on her body.
He committed the same crime three different times on three different women and he had to know his own mind I did it again and the and that's what what caught him.
A memorial headstone now sits in front of green haven prison.
A reminder of Donna pay ons brutal murder a murder experts say could and should have been prevented.
