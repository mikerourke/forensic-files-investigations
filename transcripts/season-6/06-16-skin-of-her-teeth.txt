In nineteen ninety six two young boys fishing internal high only found what looked like a human skull.
All of its teeth were missing markings on the skull told the tale of unspeakable violence.
He'S had no idea who this person was or how long the skull had been in the water.
Appleton Ohio is an industrial city of about sixty two thousand people in the southwestern part of the state.
It'S an area blessed with natural beauty.
Residents enjoyed the many rivers streams and lakes that dot the landscape.
On August seventh nineteen ninety six twelve year old Tim Lyons and his friend T. J. D. John headed to Lyndon lake for an afternoon of fishing.
Instead of a bluegill catfish the boys reeled in what looks like a skull.
The boys left the skull on the bank I'm certain of what to do.
I know my mom that they didn't believe me that there are just too far off.
Like a whole day pass before we even we went back down and it was still there.
This time the voice contacted the police first top down there.
Pretty much a break he came down there and we were shown in everything in the rock and so you know it's real Hey guys it's a big investigation just kept going on on that like we did something wrong twenty minutes later the whole police force was down there.
Bye Watson everything people scuba diving down there searching for other collusion.
It'S crazy went nuts from the police scuba divers could not find any other body parts in the lake and a search of the immediate area was also fruitless the local coroner examined the skulls and determined that the individual hadn't been in the lake long perhaps only a few weeks because there was still some soft tissue clinging to it but investigators were faced with a mystery you know when we have a Skol turn up what does that tell you it doesn't really tell you a whole lot it could be that somebody robbed a grave out in the country and then got rid of parts of the body it could be a homeless person who passed away and part of the remains got dragged out you know an animal varmint drag part of the remains some place so it doesn't really tell you that there is a homicide or foul play.
Who was this person.
How did he or she died.
And where was the rest of the body.
To assist in the identification of Connor sent the skull to the college of mount Saint Joseph outside Cincinnati to doctor best Mari one of only sixty three board certified forensic anthropologist in the United States.
This case was one of the most challenging fascinating personally rewarding but also at the same time personally terrifying cases that I think I've worked.
Dr Murray noticed a deep indentation on the top of the skull.
Which suggested the killer used a machete or a cleaver on the top of the victims had.
And Dr Marie found other cuts and scratches all over this guy.
And there were signs of trying to get the flash off of the school and it gave me chills to realize that someone had sat with the skull in their hands and the flushed it.
This call had a nose cavity indicative of a Caucasian a battery of nearly two dozen measurements fed into a computer program confirmed this was this call of the one.
Dr Marie estimated that the victim was under thirty five years of age.
Citrus of the school the lines where the individual skull bones knit together those who were still very open and they typically will tend to close with H. evidence suggested someone had use many different types of tools internet extraordinary effort to conceal the woman's identity.
A series of jagged parallel marks indicated a serrated knife the size of the kitchen steak knife had been dragged along the sides of the skull.
Cut marks on the cheek bones indicated the jaw had been forcefully removed with the small single edged blade like a pocket knife and there were several puncture wounds in the eye sockets an indication that the killer removed the victim's eyes.
The teeth were also missing in the upper jaw was broken to throat which told Dr Mari but the teeth had been deliberately.
And when you held the skull is just the right angle you could see that the weapon that was used was a needle nose pliers you could actually see marks in the bone for the players had been inserted in the teeth snapped out.
Dr Mari hesitated to tell homicide investigators about her suspicions and I thought to not going to believe me you're not going to believe that this is true and so I took the school to two other experts before I made that phone call because I had never seen anything like this before in my life it would be the most difficult murder investigation local officials had ever encountered.
Although investigators knew the skull found in Linden lake was that of a Caucasian woman under the age of thirty five they knew nothing else marks found on the skull indicated that the flash had been removed as head her teeth in an attempt to hide the woman's identity I've seen a lot of criminals try to hide their crime and conceal their activity it's almost expected but I've never seen anybody go to this length of activity to conceal a crime.
Adult and police discovered that only four individuals had recently been reported missing one was twenty one year old Tina mocked reported missing just two months before the skull was found in the lake.
Tino motto was a single mother of an eighteen month old son John she had been living here on a quiet residential street in an up stairs apartment with her twenty four year old boyfriend Tim Bradford.
Do you know much was originally from New York she met her boyfriend Tim well she was selling magazines door to door they settled in Tim's hometown of Hamilton Fortino worked as a clerk at a local store Tim was a framerate this art shop.
He was he was in his mid twenties so he pretty much enjoyed doing things that people in their mid twenties like to do go out and hang out with friends go to concerts things like that.
When questioned by police Tim said Tina had gone back to New York to visit her family and left the baby behind.
Police soon discovered that Tina might never reach New York.
Tino was reported missing not by her family but by teens mother Elizabeth Bradford so at first she didn't really think anything about it but then when she started calling New York to see if she was up there and she wasn't.
She knew she wasn't.
Away on our own well because she knew she would leave the baby alone.
Elizabeth Bradford also told police she was afraid of her son and his temper.
Armed with the warrant police searched a storage locker Bradford rendered shortly after Tina disappeared.
They found this set of nineteen kitchen knives with small medium and large serrated blades police also found a book on how to chill with your bare hands and a notebook on satanic rituals Tim Bradford's mother told police her son practiced devil worship.
Also suspicious was Tim Bradford's behavior during Tina's disappearance an ATM security camera captured pictures showing Kim Bradford withdrawing money from Tina mocks bank account after she disappeared.
Investigators also learned that Kim Bradford occasionally use drugs we know from some statements that Tina supposedly had told people she worked with that she was afraid of him because of his drug usage I'm speculating here but I think what that means is that when he's using drugs his violent temper is a little bit more flammable you know the ropes a little bit quicker has a shorter fuse and maybe that's why she's afraid of him.
Next police searched the couple's apart.
Inside they conducted a luminol test.
Amicale is sprayed on the surface it can reveal blood that has been cleaned up with water and detergents.
On the living room carpet investigators found an area believed to be human blood they also found blood on the bathroom floor in the crevice between the floor and the top and also near the toilet police suspected the Linden lakes golf was that Tina mocked but they needed scientific proof to be certain.
When a human skull was recovered from Linden lake in Ohio investigators needed to find some forensic technique to make a conclusive identification.
The most effective means of identification is by analyzing the teeth of the victim and comparing those to known dental X. rays since no two sets of teeth are exactly alike.
And in this case.
Another method of identification is cold cold photograph super imposition.
An anthropologist takes a photograph of this.
Then superimposes it over a photograph of the missing person in hopes of matching the facial characteristics.
Other techniques attempt to put a face on this.
By using facial reconstruction and forensic sculpture.
The wrench against Republic just have had only a seventy percent success rate with these techniques because teachers like the islands the mouth lips and ears are not necessarily indicated by the shape of the skull it's a technique usually used when all other means of identification have but in the case of the Linden lakes golf scientists got a genetic break.
They discovered that the killer removed all but two of the wisdom teeth which had been embedded in the gun which the killer may not have seen when the perpetrator pull the teeth he didn't realize that those molars were up underneath the gum line so those were protected and preserved.
Dr Mari extracted tooth pulp from the wisdom teeth and sent out for DNA testing along with the blood sample from Tina's eighteen month old son.
But scientists could not obtain a usable DNA profile from the two.
It'S possible that the reason is that the teeth were still unformed and when teeth are still forming their routes are open open cavities it was also possible.
As a last resort.
Dr Mari try to extract DNA from this call itself with the surgical drills.
Carefully remove six bone samples from the thickest part.
With sterile techniques the middle section of that core that I took out had never touched anything but that sterile drew.
The skull bone fragments were sent from mitochondrial DNA testing which is used in cases where the biological sample is either degraded or small in quantity in the mitochondrial DNA is unique because it's passed through the maternal bloodline you receive it only from your mother so any maternal relative you have can be tested against the sample.
Mitochondria are found in the cell cytoplasm outside the nucleus each cell contains hundreds of mitochondria.
Scientists have isolated to regions of the mitochondrial DNA where differences within the human population appear and they will look for exact matches between the mitochondrial DNA in the sample they have and the maternal blood relatives that they have.
The mitochondrial DNA from the stall was the same as the mitochondrial DNA from eighteen month old Johnny Mach which meant this call was that of his mother Tina.
And one of the long knives found in the storage shed rented by Tina's live in boyfriend tested positive for human protein.
With this news police brought him Bradford in for questioning one small.
I asked him if he knew how to hunt yes I do do you know how to.
To dissect an animal and skin it prepared for food yes how to dispose of the N. internals of an animal yes he learned at all through his childhood upbringing.
Finally Tim Bradford told police the story of almost unspeakable violence and.
It was the story of Tina marks last moments alive.
When D. N. A. testing concluded that the Linden lakes call was at a meeting a month.
Police confronted her live in boyfriend Tim Bradford with the forensic evidence against him after several hours of Bradford confessed.
Bradford led investigators to a nature preserve less than a mile from where the couple lived.
And in the deep brush fourteen as bones scattered throughout the area.
After fourteen months animals had gotten to the remains and only about half of Tina's body was recovered.
Either by a hacksaw or a knife.
James said that on the night of the murder he and Tina were playing a game of monopoly.
Radford admitted using drugs that night.
At some point the couple got into an argument tempers flared and Tim admitted hitting Tina bloodying her nose.
Do you know went to the bathroom to clean up and Bradford said he started to put away the fishing gear he had used earlier in the day.
Bradford said Tina came running out of the bathroom to continue the argument Bradford said he had a fish fillet knife in his hand and in the ensuing scuffle team admitted that he slept Tino SRO.
Bradford said he left the apartment and when he returned Tina's lifeless body was in the bath tub how she got there was a mystery to him.
Bradford said he worked through the night to dismembered the body.
He flushed her internal organs down the toilet some political and a human can do this to another human that a lot of them fathered a child with I cannot grasp that.
Bradford admitted using each of the nineteen kitchen knives in the process.
Bradford confirm using needle nose pliers to remove the tease internet for to prevent dental identification of the remains.
Cut into the flesh to begin with it's hard enough to cut the head off hold in my arms or my hands.
And pull the teeth out.
Redford carried the bones from the apartment in his backpack and in a trash bag to a deserted field.
Later he said he went to Lyndon lane.
Through this call the water.
This call never appeared this case was never been solved.
I will never proceeded as a homicide I just gone down as a missing person.
Townspeople were stunned by the news Bradford's former boss couldn't believe she had worked side by side with a cold blooded killer.
He did one out of that relationship with Tina and unfortunately he picked to very permanent way out of that relationship and he's also out of his sons life as well which is it's a real shame.
Tim Bradford had no explanation for why he killed teen other than to say he loved her and was sorry.
Tim Bradford was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and abuse of a corpse he was sentenced to twelve to twenty five years in prison.
Sam Bradford acknowledged his guilt in this exclusive letter he wrote to the producers of this program.
Bradford says quote.
I have committed an atrocity in the eyes of god and of men and for that I accept full responsibility.
My actions belie my true feelings fourteen.
Truly loved her with every fiber of my being end quote.
Bradford claims the pain of his own actions go well beyond those imposed by his prison sentence.
The nightmares I have had since that night the dreams I have where I wake up with Tina's name on my lips those will stay with me forever.
And they should it is a burden I must carry in my heart until the end of my days in this case Mister Bradford the way he treated the corpse of the person that he supposedly loved tells you that they're almost there's almost two parts to this person one where he really loves this woman and can't deal with the fact of losing her and wants to talk about what he did to her because he feels guilty about it but another side of him that could detach himself from all the motion to lean over the bath tub and the flash.
The body of somebody that you love it's just humanly impossible if you could do this to somebody that he loves what could he do to somebody but he doesn't even know or doesn't care about.
I just hope that through law enforcement officers and young detectives may be seen this case be aired that they realize don't give up you know when you get these little clues and when you have got instincts telling you something's not right keep on pushing the envelope a little bit keep on going after the evidence because that's what happened in this case and it resulted in us walking through fields and maybe we got our shoes all muddy and got a little dirty and everything but we found the last of her remains and were able to put a final conclusion to this case and I'm very proud to be a part of that quite frankly.
