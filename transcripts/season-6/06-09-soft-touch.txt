In nineteen ninety.
The killer of a twenty two year old girl left and almost indistinguishable mark in a blood stain at the crime scene.
But a new computer forensic technology found distinguishing characteristics in the smear evidence that would lead directly to the perpetrator.
Richmond Virginia is a city steeped in history.
As the former capital of the confederacy Richmond keeps close ties to its past and a watchful eye on the future.
With six colleges and universities thousands of young people move here each fall to go to school.
Twenty two year old don Bruce attended Virginia Commonwealth University don was a musician she joined the VC you wind symphony after she was accepted through auditions.
That'S what kept her there for as long as she was there don was anxious to find out what was said in the real world and how she could do and what she could do after college don worked as a phone operator by day and a waitress by night despite the long hours she enjoyed the freedom of living on her own.
Don was fun loving kind of person thought she could do anything and everything and and didn't care what other people said about her trying to do to do things that weren't the norm.
On December nineteenth nineteen ninety.
Don'S mother went to her daughter's apartment since she hadn't heard from her in a few days.
She found on in a pool of blood.
A medical examiner found evidence she had been raped sodomized and stab in the heart.
The night was which ran in the in her heart and the subject hailed don down until she bled to death which from what I understand could have been eight to ten minutes or longer and she was defiled as in a process of this that I don't know how much by how violence is needed but that's only my opinion I think it's very very bad case.
First impression I had was what a horrible horrible crime and and what somebody had done to really an innocent young lady who well who absolutely didn't deserve what happened to her in any sense of the word it was a young twenty two year old female who was working at mine in her own business at a future ahead over had had children ahead over of marriage everything that we all enjoy and she was a brutally attacked while she was sleeping.
Investigators discovered that the killer entered the apartment through a window which had been pried open.
But there was no evidence of burglary nothing had been disturbed or broken.
They found no foreign fingerprints inside the apartment.
When I left there didn't have very good feelings at all because I think everything that I cared out there the scene was in one large bag and and that consisted mostly of the items on the bed to bed sheets in the political polls and.
Of the blankets and so forth.
Don Bruce was last seen at Tommy's restaurant two nights earlier but she worked the night shift as a waitress.
Don met many people through her job which only added to the large pool of potential suspects.
Investigators Tom Taylor and Jim Dorn interviewed dawn's neighbors in the apartment complex.
Several neighbors were suspicious right from the start.
H. subject who lives directly beside that was on active parole.
And he was on parole for burglary and attempted rape all armed with a knife.
So immediately we felt that he was a good suspect.
There was very little evidence and there's one of these cases that when you left there the.
We just thought it was this will be a hard one to clear because of the lack of with no murder weapon no witnesses and few leads it was going to be difficult investigation.
She wanted to be a firefighter and she had passed her firefighter one and two and was volunteering as a firefighter so don was.
I was just.
Happy person don wanted as much out of life as she could get into every minute of it she had some point in time would have had a family wanted children.
But that was not today.
Shortly after the rape and murder of a twenty two year old don Bruce John alderman was assigned to prosecute the case.
When you get a crime like this that really violates a person you get a sense of indignation that that's impossible to escape sense of indignation it at someone being used and abused like that.
Investigators began focusing their attention on the few bits of physical evidence they had.
For rent six birds discovered that the fatal injury was a single stab wound in the heart.
In the forensics lab scientists found two linear impressions on the pillow case consistent with the blade of a knife serrated edges appeared to be those of a hunting knife.
Also on the pillow case they found what appeared to be a partial fingerprint in dawn's blocked.
But the fabric was texturing which made any kind of fingerprint analysis impossible.
Was almost invisible even to a trained the rich detail was very faint and we had to really study it because as we studied it under magnification you enlarge the fabric weave which had a tendency to totally eradicate the rich detail so at that point in time I I did not have a whole lot of hope for that fingerprint.
There was rich detail on the ramp but it didn't in my opinion at the time I didn't think it was very much knew if that's all that we would ever happened and it could not be.
Enhanced in any way then we wouldn't have much of a case unless we got a lot more evidence coming in that we didn't think we would get.
Traces of semen also were found at the scene.
Serology test indicated the killer had type a blood.
This eliminated dawn's boyfriend as well as dawn's neighbor who was on parole for rape and burglary.
Don had another neighbor Robert knight who had some prior arrests for drug possession.
Robert knight had made comments to the victim.
As she was outside washing her car going to and from your automobile to apartment this subject would make comments to her in a sick sexual suggestive nature.
And he what he became a suspect.
Robert knight had type a blood consistent with the semen sample from the crime scene.
But he had an alibi for the night of the murder.
He said he was with his girlfriend at the time.
And the fingerprint on the pillow case did not appear to match the fingerprints on file for Robert knight we tried traditional photography everything that we knew at that point in time also to develop some contrast between the ridges and the fabric but basically those techniques were not satisfactory at that point in time we we couldn't get it to a point where we felt like we had an identifiable print.
Scientists tried various chemical processes to improve the print on the pillow case.
But every time they enhanced it they also enhance the threads of the pillowcase.
Investigators were no closer to identifying the print on the pillow case than they were at the day after the murder.
The fingerprint was something that we knew we had.
Clearly was observed it clearly was saying but no one knew what to do with it because it was in a medium.
In blood on a medium on a pillow case against a pattern a little case that made it unreadable and if there was some way to make that print readable it could take on as vibrant a forensic.
Persuader is is DNA evidence and maybe some more.
Van investigators got a break.
Every year we have a latent print conference which encompasses all the late for examiners in Virginia it's a training seminar basically and.
The imaging people there one of the vendors brought their imaging system there I was highly skeptical of it I had never seen it used in a forensic case but since we had nothing else other than this very faint print on fabric we thought it was worth a try.
The new system was called image enhancement technology.
Image enhancement uses a computer to identify patterns like those woven into the pillow case once the pattern was identified it was subtracted from the image leaving only the rich patterns of the fingerprint behind.
After ten hours of testing the fabric pattern was subtracted and what began to emerge was a partial thumb print of the killer.
Investigators knew that they had to identify the fingerprint on the pillow case in order to solve dawn Bruce's murder.
The primary suspect in this case was one of don's neighbors Robert knight who had a history of drug abuse.
Knight said he had an alibi that he was with his girlfriend on the night of the merger but his girlfriend said night wasn't with her for the entire evening.
The evidence indicated the crime occurred about between three and four roughly that Saturday morning he claimed to be with his girlfriend all night but his girlfriend said no he was not with me for about that period of time between three and four the fingerprints on file for Robert knight did not have enough ridge detail to determine if they match the print on the pillow case.
Night voluntarily gave a second set of prints but again it was not enough rich detail to make a comparison.
Each time that we would which your presence around him he got a little bit more us stand standoffish and not as cooperative and I used to use a separation him and he just he's changed entirely his personality and his.
willingness to help defeat he did not want us to come around anymore.
Now the prosecution was in a difficult position.
If they could not identify the fingerprint as nights the defense attorney would use that against the prosecution out of trial.
The defense trays would've said whose fingerprint is we don't know we'll never know and that fingerprint is a killer and it's not his fingerprint or can't be proved to be his fingerprints so you know a lot of work you really need to answer all the questions and if you don't the defense attorney asked those questions a closing argument.
But prosecutors gambled they arrested night for dawn's murder pinning their hopes on the new fingerprint technology and the scientists ability to match night stinger prince.
After night's arrest norm Taylor kept a close eye on the technique police used to fingerprint making certain each finger was carefully roll from nail to nail but the clearest sect of prince possible.
As soon as I saw a good suitable role print took that straight back to my office and began that examination.
But Taylor did not rush to judgment he took his time.
After one month of analysis and retesting norm Taylor found what he was looking for.
The print on the pillow case was a left thumb print.
It matched the outside of Robert nights left.
I spent additional time doing comparison work and just analyzing the print from every angle so to speak before we actually affected the identification and even then I had another examiner go behind me and take a look at everything and I had done to make sure there were no arrests made in the process.
There was one more hurdle.
The image enhancement technology was so new it had never been accepted as evidence in court.
I was concerned at that point in time that the evidence may not be accepted within the scientific community as a good science this was the first time that anybody who used to take it in the court into a court room where it was going to be actually challenged.
And it was gonna be fought.
A hearing was held to determine whether forensic evidence from this new fingerprinting technology should be admitted the defense argued that it was hocus pocus technology which manipulated and change the image of the fingerprints.
Hammering was the expert who testified for the prosecution explaining that the human eye can distinguish between sixteen and thirty two shades of grey but the computer can distinguish two hundred fifty six shades.
Ringer said the image enhancement technology simply eliminated the fabric patterns then made the dark areas of the finger print darker and the light areas between the ridges lighter.
If somebody is dumb as I am concerned stand this when I got done with her over the course of the day and doing some studying afterwards I think the explanation becomes one that that anyone can understand this emerging enhancing doesn't change the the data at all what we had was if there's a photograph of the fingerprint and.
In Rinker said I went ahead and did it that day on March twenty seventh I could do it again today I can show you do I can replicated a hundred times I need to she did it in stages she took the the the first the pattern out and she took the weeds out and as you watch it you can see the print didn't change the print didn't move the lines of of the lands and grooves of the print didn't change at all I think that graphically was the best persuader for for judge Culp in the case.
The judge was convinced he did not believe the computer enhancements altered the bloody fingerprint.
A legal precedent had been set.
Prosecutors wanted more than the fingerprint before heading to try.
Robert Douglas knight was charged with capital murder of a twenty two year old dawn Bruce.
But police still didn't have the murder weapon.
Thank you left on a flimsy pillowcase would be considered firm evidence in court and prosecutors soon had a lead on the murder weapon.
Six months after the murder a maintenance man working on nights old apartment discovered something behind an access panel in nineteen old bedroom.
I don't know what possessed him to do that I think there's a plumbing problem that caused him to take it off when he did he looked into it found a hunting knife and she.
In the forensics lab scientists performed a simple test to determine if this was the weapon used in the March.
Using photographic overlays the pattern of the knife was compared to the knife impressions found on dawn Bruce's pillowcase.
The final piece of evidence was the DNA testing of the semen found at the crime scene.
It matched the DNA profile of Robert knight.
Prosecutors believe the dawn Bruce arrived home from work around one AM and went right to bed.
Sometime around four o'clock Robert knight went to the front window of dawn's apartment prided open.
Then sexually assaulted her and she bled to death.
But night made mistakes the white the night on the pillow case leaving the impression of the murder weapon later a match to the night bound in nights apartment.
He also left the partial bloody fingerprint on the pillow case matched with the latest in computer technology.
Facing an overwhelming amount of physical evidence and in an effort to avoid the death penalty Robert Douglas knight played guilty he was sentenced to four life terms in prison.
I'M very disappointed the.
Robin I didn't get the death penalty I think you deserve the death penalty thank the forensic science played a major part in solving the case.
Some cases are solved just Bob Bob you're interviewing without any evidence and they're all solved but I think this is one of those cases that would not have been solved.
Hello not been for the forensic evidence that was that was that saying when we arrested night we had a bare circumstantial case that's all we had and it went to being in the absolutely strong as friends in case of a prosecutor in twenty four years the only thing that stands out with me personally is that.
I believe Robert knight deserved and should have received the death penalty I don't believe he deserves to be breathing.
eating sleeping laughing whatever emotions you may experience I know one of these days you probably would be walking the street again but it will be a long time and even though justice was served I think he was deserving of the death penalty.
I tell my father daughter.
One day when we were talking about life and about her plans for family when she said that she didn't think she was going to have children because she didn't know that she could go through what I had gone through.
And I told her if I knew I had a time they don was going to be murdered.
I would still have had don because she brought such joy to us as her family.
Not ever not have children for fear of loss because life is not a guarantee.
