Within weeks of opening her medical clinic doctor Kathleen Holland had seven infants who stopped breathing and had seizures severe enough to require emergency resuscitation in our office.
Sadly more than what most pediatricians see internet tire year.
When one of the children died local health officials demanded answers.
Kerrville Texas is a quiet little community just an hour's drive from San Antonio although Kerrville is primarily a retirement community Dr Kathleen Holland saw a business opportunity.
She opened what was only the second pediatric clinic in Kerrville.
Read and Patty McClellan we're excited by the prospect of a female pediatrician coming to town a lot of mothers who want to take their kids to get a girl to a to a female doctor and this is a young doctor progressive Dr somebody to kind of breathe the fresh fresh air into the medical community there and had training in the latest techniques McClelland's daughter Chelsea was one of Dr Holland's first patients when she opened her practice in nineteen eighty two.
Chelsea was fifteen months old Tel zero arrived on the very first day of practice.
Mom called reporting that she was breathing funny and had done so again.
Previously two months ago not just moments after doctor Harlan finished the evaluation Chelsea stopped breathing.
And had to be rushed by ambulance to the said Peterson Memorial Hospital their emergency room doctors revived Chelsea.
Tests could not reveal what caused the incident.
Just one month later Chelsea visited Dr Holland's office again this time for a routine vaccination.
After being given the shot show to stop breathing turned blue and had a seizure.
Once again the child was rushed to Peterson Memorial Hospital where she was stabilized.
Later that day Chelsea was taken by ambulance to San Antonio to be evaluated by specialists.
Doctor Holland was following the ambulance and her own car along the way Chelsea went into cardiac arrest the ambulance pulled off the road so Dr Holland could assist in the resuscitation.
I jumped into the ambulance and started doing CPR and asked them where the closest facility was which was comfort so we pulled into the closest facility and unfortunately she did not respond to all of the efforts to bring back so after about twenty minutes or more in the hospital as well as all of the the efforts on route.
She was pronounced dead.
The autopsy concluded the Chelsea died of cardiac arrest attributed to sudden infant death syndrome which usually occurs in children under one year of age Chelsea have been premature and had some breathing problems at birth but by all accounts medical account she had outgrown that problem.
And said to something that afflicts kids who are younger than Charlie doctors can speak about that more authoritatively but in general you don't have kids dying of sids at the age of fifteen months.
Over the next several weeks doctor Holland had more emergencies a five month old girl started choking and wasn't able to breeze and she too had to be rushed to the hospital.
A few days later yet another child had a seizure which required emergency treatment in the first month of practice doctor Holland had seven children who suddenly and unexpectedly stops breathing had seizures and required emergency hospitalization some of them were D. life threatening influences coming in on more than a weekly basis that was totally astonishing is totally unprecedented in Kerrville we don't even have very many young families with children so ultimately other doctors or just watching this blizzard of activity got very suspicious and started asking questions and those suspicions lead medical investigators to re open their inquiry into Chelsea McClellan's death.
In the first month of practice doctor Kathleen Holland had seven children who experienced seizures and breathing problems in her office severe enough to require hospitalization.
One of those patients fifteen month old Chelsea McClellan died of cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital administrators at Peterson Memorial Hospital ask Dr Holland to attend a formal meeting to discuss the situation I was considered a prime suspect.
And my practice obviously fell back as a result it's trained to put a great strain on my marriage at the time.
Things were falling apart.
During the meeting Dr Holland reviewed each of the cases for the committee she said all of the incidents could be explained by the children's medical histories Chelsea was born premature and had a history of breathing problems even before coming to me one member of the committee asked Dr Holland if she used the drugs succinylcholine and her practice succinylcholine is a powerful muscle relax and which can cause respiratory failure in large doses it's so powerful it sometimes used in lethal injections for executions.
Dr Harman said she had a file in your office but it never used.
They also asked Dr Holland if she trusted her employees doctor Holland said she did.
That night after office hours doctor Holland spoke with her nurse genene Jones.
Doctor Holland described Jones's behavior that night as suspicious there was a lull in the conversation and the next thing she said was by the way I found that missing bylaw section of calling.
I told you before I lost a vile succinylcholine ordered a replacement for it and I found the missing model so now we have to file.
Doctor Holland suspected it was more than a mere coincidence that her nurse mentioned the exact same drug doctors asked her about in the meeting I'm just sitting there and I'm absorbing all.
And I'm putting it in perspective let's say the emergency.
The meeting regarding my emergency.
The next morning doctor Holland went to the refrigerator and found the two vials of succinylcholine both appeared to be fall in one of the caps she noticed two tiny needle marks.
And at that point in time.
My whole world collapsed and I remember being motion lane just in turmoil that morning test apps in Tremont.
Doctor Holland immediately turned the files over to the authorities doctor Holland was within our circle of suspicion of doctor Holland was very defensive in our investigation because she felt that as a captain of the ship so to speak that she was responsible for this child's death in burn mind at that time she was anticipating a flood of lawsuits from parents Janine Jones was also under suspicion Jones with the thirty three year old licensed vocational nurse divorced with two children would come to Kerrville after leaving a job in a pediatric intensive care unit in San Antonio she was sort of rough and ready personality she was very coarse rough she cursed like a sailor to talk about sex a lot even though she wasn't that tractive woman she collector to mix it up and give people a hard time.
Two vials of succinylcholine was sent to the forensic lab for testing although the file with the two needle holes appeared to be full tests indicated that eighty percent of the file had been filled with water a large dose of succinylcholine could have caused Chelsea McClellan's death unfortunately it was considered to be untraceable this is the type of drugs that after injection into the body it rapidly disappears and that stop tricycle in its original form ago sectional Coleen is made up of succinic acid and choline which your natural elements in the human body.
And without hard scientific evidence all investigators had word Dr Holland suspicions and Jeanine Jones denials.
District attorney Ron Sutton was beginning to suspect that fifteen month old Chelsea McClellan and some of the other children and Dr Holland's pediatric clinic had been intentionally injected with succinylcholine a powerful muscle relax and every child who is of a non talking age that came into this clinic with a potentially serious medical problems suddenly had a seizure.
If the child was talking age child or some other problems just to sniff or something like that didn't get it but if they had a potentially serious problem and a non talk.
They got a vial of succinylcholine and Dr Holland's office appeared to be full but had to needle holes in the cap and had been refilled with water the prime suspect was Dr Holland's nurse genene Jones since she was in the ambulance with Chelsea McClellan when she went into cardiac arrest and died.
While all this was going on in Kerrville they were similar suspicions about Jeanine Jones in San Antonio.
Just one year earlier death rates rose dramatically in the pediatric intensive care unit at bear county hospital while Janine Jones was working there Dr Vincent Tamayo the chief medical examiner for bear county heard suspicions about Janine Jones from some of his medical colleagues after awhile it became common knowledge and it became a kind of a long walk to joke.
That if you're gonna have deaths in the pediatric care unit it was always on the shift that Jeanine Charles was working Dr Tamayo passed this information on to deputy district attorney Nico Rosie who discovered that the death rates dropped as soon as Janine Jones left the hospital.
We could tell that when Jones left those peak numbers dropped immediately the the month she left the the day after she left thanks just leveled up and state level they were level going in and then just peaked right there.
And then the minute she left I'd say almost a minute I mean the date to the day.
They went back to what what the normal levels.
Officials in San Antonio called in the centers for disease control in Atlanta Georgia the premier medical investigation agency in the world Dr Gregory history was the epidemiologist assigned to analyze the death rates in the intensive care unit the fact that the deaths appear to have been declining in the late nineteen seventies and nineteen eighties early nineteen eighty one and then seem to go up again in nineteen eighty one a.
And the fact that that increase was almost exclusively on the evening shift or in the evening hours made us think that there really was something unusual that was going on there the rise in the intensive care death rates coincided with the dates Jeanine Jones worked there and Jones worked the three to eleven shift but they were more than two hundred individuals pass through the pediatric intensive care unit doctors nurses aids ward clerks therapists technicians and medical residents Dr Istri began his investigation by assigning each employee a number he charted which of the two hundred individuals were on duty at the time of the thirty suspicious deaths and the fifty or so unexplained medical emergencies.
Nurse thirty two had a significant and quite extraordinarily high risk of destitute patients when they're thirty two was working compared to one thirty would not work.
In fact that risk was ten times higher the risk of death is ten times higher when she was working compared to when she was not working and the identity of nurse number thirty two thirty two.
Prosecutors found evidence that supervisors in the intensive care unit strongly suspected Janine Jones was somehow involved in these mysterious deaths so they conducted the study begin to focus on Jeanine Jones but decided what to do would be to eliminate the LPNs.
From the staff and only staff the unit with registered nurses that's getting Jeanine out of the picture.
Doctor Holland ask hospital staff down there if you need would be a good choice for her to ask to come to her room with her and they said yes she would be a good choice and a good nurse for her therefore San Antonio got religion name centered.
The suspicious deaths in the intensive care unit stopped after Jeanine Jones left.
And the incidents mysteriously resurfaced in the medical practice where Jones was next in line.
Prosecutors were convinced a fifteen month old Chelsea McClellan had been murdered by an intentional injection of succinylcholine a powerful muscle relax and they had no way to prove it since there were no toxicology test sensitive enough to find succinylcholine in the human body prosecutors heard about a forensic scientist in Philadelphia doctor Fredric rieders who was conducting research on drugs like succinylcholine.
Chelsea McClellan's autopsy samples were sent to doctor readers who took them to the Caroline skate institute in Sweden.
They'Re an experimental protocol permitted Chelsea's tissues to be analyzed with gas chromatography this process heats and separates the various molecules in the samples then measures the speed at which they separate from one another.
In a scientific first traces of succinylcholine were discovered in Chelsea McClellan's and bomb tissues we have the hypostases awhile finding that very reasonably certain that this child was administered sectional coaling at or around the time of this order on or around the time of the onset of the symptoms and signs that then led to her death.
Genene Jones was charged with the murder of Chelsea McClellan.
And pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors believe that Janine Jones first injected Chelsea McClellan with succinylcholine in the examining room while Dr Holland was busy with Chelsea's mother.
And later injected Chelsea again in the ambulance causing her death.
The discovery of succinylcholine in Chelsea McClellan's tissues the diluted filed with the needle holes found in Dr Holland's office and the fact that you need Jones was alone with each of the infants at the time of their seizures all told the story.
The last witness I believe that testified in the treatment and a carbocation Georgetown.
Engine eight it said you know what this place needs or some point you said is that what this place needs is a.
Pediatric intensive care unit.
And and obviously she would want to be the head nurse and this other person said I think was another nurse.
Said we'll put your name we don't have any critically ill children like that out here.
And Jennings said.
Yes you do you just need to know go out find out on February sixteenth nineteen eighty four genene Jones was found guilty of the murder of Chelsea McClellan by injection of succinylcholine.
And was sentenced to ninety nine years in prison in a later trial Janine Jones was also convicted of one count of injury to a child while working at bear county hospital in San Antonio specifically for injecting an infant with twenty two thousand units of heparin a near fatal dose for that crime Janine Jones was sentenced to an additional sixty years in prison what happened with Janine was doing was injecting these children with drug called heparin and which is a blood thinner and and because it's a blood thinner these children's little ones wouldn't coagulate and consequently they started who's in.
blood from all the stick marks Janine Jones began creating havoc in the intensive care unit in San Antonio because of what prosecutors believe was her contempt for some of the doctors and registered nurses who worked there but she was still an LPN she did have the education they had it she wasn't going to go as far as they were going to go and I think she resented that.
And when Jeanine Jones left San Antonio she continued her rampage in Kerrville.
There'S so many people that that could have indeed stop shinning Jones at some point could have done the right thing and failed to do it it's really a story about the medical.
bureaucracy it's a story about.
Medical politics it's a story about institutions that fail to do what they should do for all the wrong reasons that that that are afraid of bad publicity and scandal and litigation and so allow Ginny Jones to go often and harm kids in Kerrville and murder Chelsea McClellan that's what makes it the terror of the truly tragic tale.
Doctor Holland says she relied on the positive employment reference bear county hospital provided for Janine Jones before hiring her despite a broken marriage numerous lawsuits and near bankruptcy doctor Holland St in Kerrville Texas to rebuild her practice she says it has taken me years to regain the trust of the community in February of nineteen eighty four the practice was down to sing for patients a week.
