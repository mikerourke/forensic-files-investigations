At the age of twelve this young man's testimony helped convict the man who murdered his mother.
Five years later discrepancies in the autopsy led him to question if the murdered woman really watched his mother.
If it wasn't an innocent man had been sent to prison.
This well manicured neighborhood in Mansfield Ohio was home to one of the most successful doctors in town Dr John Boyle known as Jack to family and friends had built up a thriving medical practice in Mansfield that was the envy of his colleagues he had what the investigators called the largest medical practice in Richland County one out of thirteen people we have a hundred thirty thousand people live in Richland County used Dr Boyle as your physician.
Jack and his wife Noreen had been married for more than twenty years Noreen enjoyed the status they had achieved in the community she was one who like to kind of maybe put on some airs and she was very interested in social status and I think was concerned about what people thought of her the couple had two children a twelve year old son collier and a two and a half year old daughter Elizabeth whom they adopted from Taiwan.
From outward appearances they appeared to be a happy family.
But Jack Boyle had a not so well kept secret.
Jack was having numerous sexual affairs with other women no renew about Jack's affairs but according to friends look the other way in an effort to keep the family together.
It wasn't long until collier was old enough to figure things out for himself.
Especially after seeing his father kissed another woman romantically.
For no reason this was the last straw and she filed for divorce.
Jack Boyle had been planning to move his medical practice to hearing Pennsylvania about three hours away he asked Noreen to join him there to make a fresh start.
On new year's day in nineteen ninety nerene Boyle missed a lunch date with their best friend who called police to report her missing.
Call your Boyle and his grandmother told investigators that marine and Jack had an argument on new year's eve and that nerene left home after the argument getting.
So if you look at the actual circumstances they were believable the fact that she walked out the door she was very upset I don't know whether other issue may have may have come up maybe another girlfriend or something like that and would've concert just stepped in and leave and and that's not beyond belief it's not even unusual on our business.
Ma'Am can you tell me where doctor with Jack left in the morning you know what he's doing Dr Boyle's mother said Jack left after breakfast for Erie Pennsylvania to work on the new home he has purchased.
Nerene boils friends were suspicious they doubted that marine would ever leave home without her children but Dr Boyle had no history of domestic violence and his mother said she heard nothing unusual or suspicious on the night nerene disappeared.
There was no word from the region boils.
People in Mansfield wondered if she'd left town to get away from her husband's infidelities or if she was a victim of foul play.
In January of nineteen ninety nerene boiled the pretty forty four year old wife of a prominent position in Mansfield Ohio had been reported missing.
The children family members said the couple argued on new year's eve and Jack said marine left the home after the R. K..
But a neighbor who was awake that night said he didn't see anyone leave the boil residents between midnight and four o'clock in the morning.
Police searched the Boyles home looking for evidence of violence when we arrived in Hawthorne lane we were fully staffed with the lab coats we went into to process the scene for the potential evidence of maybe a homicide happened and we got done we pretty much just shrugged her shoulders and left.
The day after nerene disappeared Jack Boyle had driven to Transylvania where he had planned to move his medical practice.
When police looked into the couple's background they discovered the Jack Boyle was a serial philanderer.
The number of extramarital relationships which were known to the entire family.
In one instance Congress saw his father kiss and hug a woman named sherry Campbell whom he introduced as his good friend Tyler this is sherry how friendly.
Good how are you what caught call years attention was the cherry Campbell was wearing a ring that belonged to his mother as a lowlife type thing was take his wife.
jewelry steal it from his wife and then place it on his mistress finger and acted like he bought that ring specifically for sherry Campbell just six weeks before Noreen Boyle disappeared.
Apple had purchased a new home.
But the signature on the purchase agreement was that of an share a boil which was not not remains middle name and the description given by the real estate agent did not match Noreen Boyle.
The realization described the young lady that was with Dr Boyle as being pregnant and very young and certainly that didn't resemble of the photos that I had of Noreen who is a little bit older and blonde haired attractive woman.
Also suspicious was the Jack Boyle didn't negotiate the sales price he agreed to pay the full asking price in exchange for the sellers promise to be out of the home by January first.
David mess more suspected that Boyle may have had a specific reason why he wanted to have possession of the eerie home by January first and why he was making frequent trips there following his wife's disappearance.
Miss Moore took a calculated risk and visited call your boil at school so he could speak to the boy along.
Call yours or anything more you can tell me about the fight.
I heard a big coming from my parents room because it was even more forthcoming than he had in an earlier interview father walked down the hall.
It was awakened by a loud thump shortly after that his father you heard him walking down the hallway to his room.
And he remembers his father opening the door and looking in in him for a long period of time.
And did anything happen the next day did he say anything to the next one.
Well he told me mom went on a little vacation and call your had more information about his father's trips to.
Collier also told me that after his father got back from that weekend in Erie his shoulders and arms are very sore and call you had to rub liniment on him which was unusual.
A check of local businesses revealed Jack Boyle had rented a Jack hammer from the easy rental center in Mansfield a few days before nerene disappeared and it also purchased a roll of indoor outdoor carpet.
The realtor who sold Dr Boyle his new home told investigators that he asked some unusual questions about the property he said that is there a chance that I could lower the floor in the basement because my kids like to play basketball downstairs so we put together those two pieces of evidence that he wanted to lower the basement floor any rented a Jack hammer and his wife was missing.
Investigators suspected that it was doctor boils mistress Sherrie Campbell who signed Noreen Boyle's name to the sales agreement and the cherry Campbell was pregnant with Jack Boyle's baby.
The next step was to look inside Dr Boyle's new.
Just over three weeks after Noreen Boyle disappeared police got a search warrant for Jack Boyle's new home in Erie Pennsylvania investigators knew Dr Boyle had rented a Jack hammer a few days before his wife disappeared.
And the doctor Boyle had been making almost daily trips to hear a during the three weeks his wife had been missing.
This is the police videotape of that search.
In the garage police found the new green indoor outdoor carpeting Jack Boyle had recently purchased but little else.
From there police check the basement.
The floor had recently been painted gray and new shelves installed at one end so is the technicians were on the floor and and looking around one of the most went over to the wall the concrete to block basement and said there's a little bit of new.
The concrete it's like a mortar or something it's kind of song.
At that point after we docked down the shelving and pull up the indoor outdoor carpeting.
There was a little depression for carefully.
They dug a small hole.
Police smelled the strong odor of decomposition.
The freshly poured concrete was the new badly decomposed body of a middle aged woman.
Head covered with a plastic bag.
She was wearing an expensive Rolex watch with no reason boils initials engraved on the back.
The watch should stop on December thirty first the day in the rain boiled disappeared.
To identify the body a forensic odontology just compared the victim's teeth dental X. rays of marine boil after he completed his work he looked at those made the comparisons and actually in the market now it's this is this person he made the identification of the victim was a factory bought.
The autopsy concluded that marine boiled was suffocated after she was struck on the head with a blunt object.
Prosecutors now on you why Jack Doyle wanted to take possession of his new home earlier than the sellers originally wanted to vacate because as part of the murder plot to kill her on the early morning hours of December thirty first nineteen eighty nine and he wanted to have a funeral place for the burial and that was this new home that he wanted in before January first nineteen ninety part of the murder plan plaque or this prior calculation.
That plan also included the rental of the Jack Kammer and Dr Boyle bringing his mother home so she could babysit while he disposed of the body.
But prosecutors could find no evidence that the body was transported to Erie in Jack Boyle's car we did vacuum sweeping small cars we try to see if there is any association with the victim in the car that would not be normal and there was really nothing that was drawn of any value from the analysis the bureau.
And the plastic bag found wrapped around the remains had did not contain any identifiable fingerprints.
A couple of days later investigators found over a ton of concrete chips in Mansfield Ohio on a deserted piece of property owned by a business associate of Dr Boyle who also happened to be the uncle of Sherrie Campbell Dr Boyle's girlfriend.
And it was shaped up like you put on top of the burial for.
It was actually mold and shape this concrete as if somebody was buried underneath.
And a witness reported seeing Dr Boyle in his pickup truck near the place where the concrete chips were found.
To find out whether the cement debris came from the basement floor in the eerie home.
Investigators took samples to Larry picture tally at CTL engineering.
Fisher tally perform what is called a petrographic analysis.
Based on our analysis we were able to show that the sample that came out a pile of concrete debris in Mansfield Ohio matched the sample that came out of the original basement floor slab in Erie Pennsylvania and therefore they were both from the same structure.
Prosecutors believed they had an open and shut case until a family member delivered a bombshell the news that marine Boyle was still alive.
I think I could do that sure this has like a really good idea.
What is the middle of the night nerene boiled disappeared she was on the telephone with the girlfriend when her husband Jack came home with his mother who was visiting for the holidays.
Well I guess check isn't going to murder me tonight because his mother is spending the night but prosecutors believe that was exactly Jack's plan to murder no rain that night while his mother was there so she could babysit the children as he got rid of the body also part of this plan was Jack taking possession of his new home by January first and the rental of the Jack hammer.
Sometime after midnight on new year's day nineteen ninety boils argued jacks struck his wife on the head in their bedroom.
All your said he pretended to be asleep.
The next morning Boyle drove his wife's body to his new home in Erie Pennsylvania three hours away.
Boyle used a jackhammer to take no reduced rate then filled the hole with newly mixed concrete the indoor outdoor carpeting was placed on top.
He transported the concrete debris back to Mansfield to get rid of the evidence of the burial I think Dr Boyle was theorizing that that he was going to have a very successful practice is going to make a lot of money in Erie Pennsylvania it was going to move there and he was going to have a girl that he had had a relationship with and it was about to have a baby with at his side he wanted to have his other two children with him but he didn't want Noreen around.
In his mind that was a six successful conclusion of this whole situation is to just remove her from the scene I think John Boyle as somebody who has himself convinced he didn't do this but I think that he is a pathological liar I think that he had lied to people throughout his life he lied to his wife about his girlfriends he lied to his girlfriend's about his other girlfriends he he lied to people about his military experience I think he was such a good liar he believed those lies doctor Jack Boyle was charged with first degree murder in the death of his wife and the key witness against him was his own son.
Told jurors of his father's infidelities I told her I said mom please sit down she says what Congress to displace it down or something I have to tell you and she said okay I said I think that he has a girlfriend and then she said old kai that's impossible he can't have a girlfriend and I explained to her that Daddy had kissed her and hug her and.
So then I made to my mother that I did and she said that's okay she said I knew I was in an impossible position because you're also told the jury what he heard from his parents bedroom on the night his mother disappeared I heard a thud a little okay could you describe this sound for his about this loud.
And then about a minute and a half later I heard I mean half a minute later I heard of a site like this.
That time I was petrified I mean I was just scared.
The jury found Dr boiled guilty and sentenced him to life in prison without possibility of parole for twenty years but the story doesn't end there after the trial Jack Boyle's brother said nerene Boyle had called him on January second nineteen ninety two days after her supposed murder.
He said he wanted to testify at the trial but it's not been call.
Maintaining his innocence from his prison cell Jack Boyle also contended that the coroner had misidentified the victim there certainly are discrepancies that warrant a review of the autopsy very careful review of the autopsy in particular because of the capital case.
To back up these claims.
Get out discrepancies in the autopsy which describe the body in the basement is having the wrong eye color.
The wrong way.
This is do not grow after they're removed it just happened physiologically joining him in the request for exhumation was his son.
By this time was sixteen years old he was concerned about the discrepancies in the autopsy now almost five years later he wanted to make sure it was his mother's body police found in the basement.
The body was exhumed and tested using the mitochondrial DNA analysis which confirmed what the prosecution always contended the body was that of the marine boil.
That was re try to poke a hole in a major hole in the prosecution's case but forensic evidence actually backfired on him in showed conclusively that it was in fact Noreen well.
The autopsy report did contain some factual errors but in the end D. N. A. testing left no doubt and provided some closure for call your boil scientific proof that his suspicions on the night his mother disappeared were unfortunately correct well I don't think there's ever any way to a race the herd that's inside him.
To have your father kill your mother is probably the most devastating thing could ever happen to you and so I think he's always going to suffer with that until hopefully time heals that and and maybe put set the back of his mind so far from.
