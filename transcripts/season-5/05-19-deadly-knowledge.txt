At the start of the fall semester in nineteen ninety five.
The three year old college coed Tina Baker was reported missing.
She had been working on a research project studying the health risks of high priced call girls in Detroit.
But she soon discovered that prostitutes face more than health risks in their job.
They face the possibility of buying.
Tina Becker was a twenty three year old psychology major about to enter her senior year at Oakland university outside of Detroit.
She was raised in a military family and friends knew her as vivacious and hard working.
In a bigger was the all American girl she came from a Coast Guard family her father was a Coast Guard commander her mother was a registered nurse the people who knew Tina and who were closest to her knew her as a very fun loving dedicated students a well liked by all her peers and colleagues and very much beloved by your family a great big sister great daughter.
Do you know worked her way through school as a waitress at the Rochester chophouse and lived with her boyfriend Todd Nurnberg internet scale apartment complex not far from school.
Toddler and burger was a student at the university of Michigan the two had an on again off again relationship and friends weren't sure whether it would work out.
Tina also had another side to her she could be distrustful she could be vengeful she had a temper at times too this was a teen at that not a lot of people who knew her saw.
Tino was conducting a research project for school entitled a survey of sexual history and health practices among women employed as escorts she wanted to find out if high priced call girls and street prostitutes had the same knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases.
She decided that she wanted to do her own study she thought it would help her get into a good graduate school and she decided to study high class call girls and their awareness of aids and then she was going to compare the two.
On August twenty third nineteen ninety five Todd left for work he said Tina was still asleep when he left.
When he returned home that night she was gone.
Todd immediately phone police.
Usually missing persons the case is wrapped up within a couple days.
Maybe even a couple of hours usually phone calls could be made to determine where the person is or where they've been.
From the start this case was different.
Tina'S car was gone none of her personal belongings were missing from the apartment.
None of Tina's friends had seen or heard from her and police also discovered Tino was planning to move into her own apartment without Todd.
The fact that it's.
Tino was looking to move to another apartment was actually in the process of looking to get into another apartment.
the lead me to think that there was something wrong.
Dads maybe I need to talk to title a bit further about what was happening in their lives maybe that there was something I was missing.
Police learned Tina found evidence that Todd was seeing another woman.
And in an unexpected twist.
Police discovered that Tino was hiding some secrets of her own.
Twenty three year old psychology student Tina Baker was a hardworking honor student who friends say had a promising career ahead of her.
She disappeared without a trace shortly before the fall semester at Oakland university outside of Detroit.
When her boyfriend Todd learned burger called police to report her missing police were naturally suspicious.
The two had an on again off again relationship.
A few months earlier Tina found a suggestive greeting card to Todd from another woman and realize that Todd had been unfaithful people had seen them fight sometimes he was very devoted but sometimes they had a very combustible relationship he spent more time with her than anyone else he probably knew her better than anyone else he would seem like a natural suspect.
Despite their differences top Nurnberg denied any involvement in Tina's disappearance Tina worked as a waitress at the Rochester chophouse.
When Todd called to see if she had reported to work he was told that Tina had quit her job four months earlier.
Tina said nothing about quitting her waitressing job and had continued to launder her waitressing outfits as if nothing had changed.
Todd searched their apartment looking for some clue as to where Tina might have gone.
John found a duffel bag he had never seen before.
Bye hi stockings lingerie sexual lubricants credit card slips envelopes addressed to the L. A. escort service with the name crystal in the upper left hand corner.
The owners of the LA escort service said they didn't know anyone by the name of Tina.
They said the crystal was the name of one of their more popular escorts.
Escort services operate in most large cities and all for female companionship demand in return for fees ranging from a hundred and fifty dollars to three hundred dollars per hour.
Among the services provided is usually sex.
Now began to suspect that Tina had been living a Secret Life as a high priced call girl.
She decided she was going to do a study of high class call girls and their awareness of aids and she began contacting services asking if she could talk to the girls she started doing that and I think in the process became sort of enamored with what they were doing I think in part it was the money she was broke she had maxed out our credit cards she needed a new car she had to pay for school the money they make is a lot more than you make working at a steak house at one point she was making two hundred fifty dollars for an appointment maybe women haven't little fantasy about themselves.
Maybe all women do it maybe she lifted out.
I think she had a fantasy about herself I think she wanted more attention in kind of a distant way and make a call girl she was getting it because that's the kind of attention you get.
maybe gave her power.
After initially denying it the escort service eventually admitted what Todd already suspected that Tina Baker worked as an escort.
Professional name crystal.
They also revealed that Tina worked for two other escorts services can have dozens of clients.
That also meant dozens of possible suspects.
The investigation into Tina Biggar's disappearance revealed a dark secret for the past year Tina had been working as a high priced call girl.
It'S probably very important for Tina to keep this information or what was going on her life away from her boyfriend because she was living with him.
He knew so much about her.
But at the same time if if he had determined that she was involved with an escort service actually working for one.
I would say that would have caused a great deal of havoc in his life.
And their lives together he naturally was despondent at one point he even consider killing himself with a gun that he had but he called some friends they talked him out of it and he decided basically that he was going to do whatever needed to be done that he owed it to Tina to get to the bottom of what happened to her.
Records from the escort service revealed numerous requests for Tina services from a man named can trend cheetah.
Their first meeting took place at the bluebird motel just twelve days before Tina's disappearance.
Among thirteen as personal items found in her apartment was a love letter from can.
Your teen my heart is yours for you to keep your love will lift me off my feet.
Came to me your love so willing I know it's worth all are waiting.
When police entered can trying to cheat as apartment.
They noticed the name crystal on some artwork attached to his refrigerator.
A local car dealer said Tina was with can trim cheetah looking at new cars together.
Well if you want it in the can had offered to loan her money for the car.
You can train sheet it was a forty two year old ex convict with a history of passing bad checks forgery fraud embezzlement and theft.
He was not the wealthy businessman he portrayed to deny.
Sort of a drifter a loner and was petty season or a petty con man type of a person he held down some menial jobs so but not for very long I thought it was just like kind of a little weasel really I don't know how she would describe him he had kind of a little voice and he was sort of a static really he just was a guy who probably.
Fourteen it was going to be his girlfriend or something.
Trenches admitted meeting Tina Baker whom he first knew as crystal through the escort service he said the later met without the agency knowing and the team to stop charging him for their sexual liaisons since the two had become friends.
He told police that he had driven team at the airport just one week earlier for a flight to Ohio where she was going to serve as a client.
A check of flight logs showed no record of Tina Baker on any flight to Ohio.
Can said Tina left her car with him for safe keeping while she was away.
When police asked to inspect the car transient willingly obliged.
Inside police found names and addresses of more escort service clients along with directions to their homes we have learned through.
Work found in her car and to the escort service that she actually had contact with people that were living out of the country.
They were living out of state so it's possible that she could have just taken off contemplates.
Although the trunk was filled with debris.
A preliminary search found no evidence of foul play.
Research shows that most first time killers dispose of their victims bodies and locations the killer is familiar with so police used cadaver dogs to search areas near trenches home.
Michigan state trooper Richard he too works with high up that run cadaver dog trained specifically to find human bodies.
To train the dogs the troopers hide a small sample of human tissue or fluid in there with a training area the dog isn't rewarded for finding animal remains with the rewarded for finding human remains.
So they're going to decline a lot harder look a lot harder because if they're working for that reward.
Trooper he too and kat searched wooded areas around can trend cheaters rented home as well as the grounds of the nearby monastery were trained cheetah often walked.
Although the search hundreds of wooded acres they found nothing with no evidence to hold can train cheetah he was released from police custody.
It was a mistake police would soon regret.
After police questioned can trend cheetah about the disappearance of Tina Baker he was released because of a lack of evidence even though they suspected he knew more about her whereabouts and he told them.
It was clear cans relationship with Tina was more than just business sense a love letter from Ken was found in Tina's belongings and Ken had promised a lonely Tina the money for a new car.
Was he going to help her get a car he made promises he's probably telling her things.
To maybe make her hang on to him maybe she was making him think that they were friends just to kind of get some things take care of.
With no other leads police decided to take a second look inside Tina's car.
To their embarrassment what they first thought were coffee stains on the side of the car now appeared to be blood.
And when they peeled back the trump card.
They found a pool of blood on the right hand side.
The investigation was already being looked at as a homicide more so than perhaps another case might have been but once they found that blood there was really no question.
The amount of blood in the trunk pointed to murder and since the car had been and can try to cheat his possessions since Tina's disappearance he was the prime suspect but by this time can train cheater advantage.
Police finally got a break in the case one month after Tina bigger disappeared.
Can trend cheetahs brother suggested that police search a deserted home once owned by his aunt.
The home was just ten miles from Tina Baker's apartment.
In the woods in the backyard.
Police found the badly decomposed body of a young woman.
Since there were no pools of blood near the body this told forensic scientists that the murder had taken place somewhere else.
An analysis of dental records later revealed the body was that of Tina Baker.
Since the decomposition started in the neck area the coroner suspected Tina had been strangled since decomposition begins in the areas where there is bleeding at the time of death it was a a natural cause of death there was no fractured anywhere even in the head area Seoul mac has to be a place where the event happened and we call it the next time I could not identify specifically that was slashed she was strangled to us mother I cannot say that has to be a neck injury and that was the conclusion.
Ryan cheater was eventually spotted in a run down neighborhood in downtown Detroit.
Police closed Dan can made a weak attempt at slitting his wrists in the bathroom before giving himself up.
After several hours of police interrogation can train cheetah finally admitted.
That he and Tina had an argument over money.
You don't have the money to.
I have the money the money is coming they had struggled and Tina fell hitting her head and died.
But X. rays of Tina's skull contradicted that scenario.
She did not have any skull fracture anyway if she bled inside of the skull I would have seen some blood staining inside of the skull which was not present.
Although Tina may have suffered a head wound as evidenced by the blood found in Tina's trunk the wound was probably not fatal when trained cheetah was confronted with this information.
A statement shop police what he said was Tina was just so miserable in those last days that I made a sudden decision to end it for her and put her out of her misery the minute the police here heard that statement I thought holy Jesus guilty of your honor.
No can train cheetah accepted a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to second degree murder.
Tina'S family reluctant to have penis double life made public agreed to the deal.
Prosecutors believe when Tina discovered can had lied to her about having the money to buy the new car the two four.
Teva struck her head and was later strangled or smothered to death.
Can place Tina's body in the trunk of her car and then dumped the body in the woods near his aunt's home.
It was a tragic end to an unfortunate story.
Can train changer was sentenced to life in prison.
Ironically while Tina was living a life of deception she was deceived by can trenches.
Con man offering the promise of a big long.
If Tino was brought into this double life under some kind of illusion that it was going to be like a scene from pretty woman and Richard Gere was going to come rescue her and you know bring her wonderful gifts and she was going to fall into this opulent lifestyle that that's not the reality of the call girl world you could meet up with some very desperate characters and some very bizarre characters on this case unfortunately the person that she met up with was that Richard Gere it was ten and where Tina ended up flying in that field this more the reality then the movie I think.
Chose to cross the line.
She paid the ultimate price.
What all of us as parents guard against unfair the most I think for our children.
And I believe by telling teen a bigger story that we sent a message.
Two other girls who might be in the business two other young women who might be thinking of going into the business two young women who might think they can tease or play a little bit with a world that they don't belong in.
I think that sends a message that you're asking for trouble.
That you can end up in a situation that you can't handle that you can end up dead.
