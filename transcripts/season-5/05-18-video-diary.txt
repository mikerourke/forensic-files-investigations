In nineteen ninety eight the convenience store clerk in Lansing Michigan was shot to death during a robbery.
No one else was in the store at the time.
But there was an eyewitness a security camera.
Unfortunately the story is told was far from clear.
One the masons a forty eight year old single mother of three she had worked in various cities across the country trying with mixed success to build a stable life for her family in nineteen ninety seven she settled with her children in Lansing Michigan.
With money tight she took a job at this convenience store gas station to make ends meet about a year later the owner decided to keep the store open twenty four hours a day.
One the Mason works the very first overnight shift she was kind of struggling and so in the gas station was looking for someone to work the overnight shift because they had been open overnight for a while I'm wondering just kind of jumped at it and now she works the overnight shift so that she could be home with her family during the day and take care of her grandkids and then.
The store was located in a low crime area but as a precaution the security camera was installed before the first overnight ship.
A fresh video tape was unavailable so workers used an old worn out tape until they could buy a new one.
At four eighteen in the morning.
The customers entered the store to pay for gas and found one the mace and a pool of blood behind the counter.
They called nine one one.
We just came in and there was a lady that.
By the time emergency personnel arrived Wanda Mason was dead with a single gunshot wound to the head I spent twenty two caliber long shell casing was next to the body.
Police were surprised when one just twenty one year old son Donnie came into the store just moments after they arrived he showed up before police notified the family.
We got there there's people there and they told us that there is a lady in line behind the counter so we went around back to the counter and my mom was lantern.
I lost it was it was my mom what he expects and I couldn't handle it it was a tough thing to deal with.
The cash register showed that one the Mason had been killed four three hundred fifty one dollars.
Strangely Wanda told family members just days earlier but she was not afraid to work the night shift because she had a plan in case she was robbed if anybody came in to rob a gas station then because we discussed to working the overnight shift I'm sure I would just give them the money and get a lot of there you know and and deal with that later she said the the if somebody tried to rob that should help me carry it to the car it wasn't her money and she wasn't worth her nine thousand in all concern of hers you know that's.
The business's problem not hers and that was her whole outlook on it it's not my money and I'm not dying for.
These questions everyone in the neighborhood and searched the store for clues.
We had officers set up a perimeter and we got a canine track going a couple blocks away officers spotted a guy running down the road with a paper bag in his hand coming from the direction of the store.
So they detained him and brought him back to the office so that we could talk to him we were hoping that we had already got a guy.
The suspect a twenty year old African American was brought in for questioning.
Was the security camera video clear enough to identify whether the suspect was the killer.
When one the Mason was murdered in the convenience store where she worked detectives turned to their one and only what is.
The security video camera.
Full action video is made up of thirty frames per second but this security video was designed in time lapse mode which is only four frames per second the result is an unstable image which was compounded by the fact that it was recorded on an old badly degraded video tape.
Police sent the tape to add Jeannie at future media corporation.
When we played at some of the pictures shifted and distorted making the whole video sequence look unusable but when we transfer the videotape to a broadcast video machine okay then isolate the good images from the bad.
On the left hand side of the screen the tape shows a car pulling up to the store at three forty nine AM.
A man wearing a dark jacket enters the station and appears to be casing the area.
He seems to notice Wanda Mason working in a back room.
He then leaves without buying anything.
Ten minutes later the same man returns this time with the foot in his jacket over his head he goes straight to the back room beyond the range of the security camera.
At gun point he forces wanted to the front counter.
She opens the cash register and the man takes the money he then steps back as if he's leaving.
He lowered his hood walks out of the store while stuffing the long barrelled pistol into his coat.
Police had a suspect in custody a man found running away from the scene with a bag in his hand.
But the bag did not contain the stolen money but candy and we didn't have a gun.
The young man said he was running from the scene because as a young African American he feared he would be wrongfully arrested and he was right the image on the videotape the degraded did not look like the suspect we compare the guy on the tape to the guy we had in custody at that time it was pretty obvious that they were not the same guy so we had to cut him loose and we felt like we had just taken her first giant step backwards in investigation.
Investigators still had two pieces of evidence a spent shell casing and the degraded image on the security camera videotape.
With this image police sketch artist Rodney Sadler Dhruv this composite drawing of the suspect three days after the murder it was released to the press police say that early Saturday morning this man entered the marathon gas station and hold and shot one point blank in the head tips forward into the police.
But since the composite drawing of the suspect was based on the scratchy videotape image it was difficult to know which tips where relevant and which were not when this case started out all we had was the video and you see in the video and if that's all you have.
Not feeling very good about your chances of ever resolving this case and while police continue their investigation they were also suspicious of wonder Mason's son Donnie Warren.
The videotape shows him highly agitated after seeing his mother's body.
Investigators wondered why he was in the store in the middle of the night just moments after the merger before police had time to notify the family.
He showed up at the scene ten minutes after the shooting the police interviewed him of course immediately he advanced the notion that the perpetrator was black and how could he possibly have known that that information and not been made public in one of the customers who found miss Mason's body told us that Donnie was running around the front of the store saying I'm gonna kill that for her.
How did he know it was a lone blackmail when we hadn't even reviewed the tape yeah.
Police discovered the Donnie Warren was unemployed with very little money.
On the night of the murder he was out drinking at a strip club.
Knowing that his mother would not resist robbery that store made it seem like an easy target where they could hit the store split up the money and nobody would get hurt.
Tips continue to pour in from people who thought they recognized the composite sketch.
The question for police.
Is whether this man was simply a random killer or someone connected to the victim's son.
Police suspected that won the masons murder was a random act of violence.
Police were suspicious when Wanda son happened to walk into the store at four o'clock in the morning just moments after the shooting.
Duddy this friends just happen to show up a little too conveniently right after the robbery as if to console his mother.
Donnie denied having anything to do with his mother's murder and he said his statement that an African American must have murdered his mother was simply an unfortunate remark nothing more than speculation said in anger.
Police received a tip from a woman who said she recognised the police composite sketch of the killer on television.
Yes she identified the man as Ronald Leon Allen her former boyfriend who lived in the nearby town of Jackson.
Ron Allen was a small time criminal with prior arrest for assault and drug activity.
His mugshot resembled the police sketch and the individual on the security camera videotape.
We found out that Ronald Allen was a suspect in a shooting in Jackson and the Jackson police said two twenty two caliber shell casings from the shootings we took those shell casings and a shell casing that we found near one of Mason's body to the crime lab to see if they may have been fired from the same gun.
Analysts said the casings appeared to be from the same guy but the only way to be sure was to test fire the actual gun for comparison.
And police couldn't find it.
Police also look for a link between Ron Allen and Donnie Warren we tried everything we could think of to connect on a warrant to Ronald Allen and every time we came up short so we decided to put down the on the back burner and concentrate all our efforts and Ronald Allan.
Was Ron Allen the shooter and could the videotape identify.
Allen was five feet three inches tall.
What was the height of the shooter in the videotape.
To find out detectives went back to the store to recreate the merger with great dated height chart set up around the store and using the door and sun glass display as reference points a high test was conducted using the same security camera set at the same angle with the same framing that recorded the actual murder.
When the test video as compared to the merger video it showed that the shooter was five feet four inches tall.
Ron Allen's mug shot was taken when Allen was in his stocking feet with shoes Allen would stand five feet four inches.
Ron Allen voluntarily agreed to take a polygraph test.
If you have anything to do with what is happening on the pitch.
At this point police needed to make sure that Ron Allen was the man in the security videotape.
One of the things that we have encountered time and time again you have a small business owner and certainly they have limited resources and they feel that they get some kind of protection by having a video camera set up security cameras set up in the business and certainly that should work as a deterrent to some criminals but when someone commits a crime anyway if you have cheaper sub standard equipment it's not going to be much help very law enforcement once processed and transferred investigators got a little better look at the killer.
But would it be good enough.
Even though investigators had a better image of Wanda Mason's Keller it still wasn't clear enough to make a positive identification with their suspect.
The images were sent to doctor Ron carpenter at Caribbean and image reconstruction firm that worked to repair the digital images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Those pictures from outer space or badly flawed but video reconstruction transform those inferior images into viewable ones what was an opportunity to to it takes some of our technology that was developed under.
NASA and the department of defense funding and apply to a local problem the first step was to reduce the distortion in the images from the security video tape by building mathematical models of each image these models identify the excess extraneous information which is then eliminated leaving only the essential information behind.
It'S like focusing a camera that's the process involved we had a set of algorithms to sharpen the image with us focusing camera or probably it's like taking the thumb print print off your eye glasses hearing him up such that you can see with high definition which looks investigators now had a clean image but the pictures were shot from a distance in order to match the pictures to their suspect investigators turned to forensic anthropologist Dr Norman sour he applied a technique called photos skulls super imposition.
He took the mugshot of the suspect Ron Allen and super imposed over the image taken from the security camera.
And what we're able to do is superimposed images on one another and compare aspects of morphology to evaluate the likelihood of an identification morphological features included things like the shape of the face the shape of the eyes the shape of the root of the nose was an important feature in this case the distance from the root of the nose to the hairline slowly.
The images were laid on top of one another and revealed the identity of one the masons killer.
What he did was he identified the certain unique characteristics in the face in the video which makes us each look different from anybody else and he was able by by focusing on those those different aspects of the face that are unique to an individual was able to.
Prosecutors feared that defense lawyers would challenge the use of the process video tape for identification.
The only other evidence was the twenty two caliber long shell casing found at the scene.
Ron Allen's cousin was looking through some of Allen's stereo equipment when he noticed something behind the speaker cover.
A long barreled twenty two caliber Ruger handgun we took the gun straight to the state police crime lab where tests confirmed that it was the gun that was used in both wanna Mason's murder and shooting in Jackson and that was great news.
He'S also discovered that Ron Allen owned an Oldsmobile cutlass automobile that had been customized with expensive chrome wheels and chrome rear view mirror.
These same customized features could be seen on the vehicle outside of the convenience store after electronic enhancement.
Ronald Allen was charged with first degree murder.
Police were satisfied the Donnie Warren had nothing to do with his mother's murder.
I was innocent and there is no way they could possibly ever say that I wasn't and I have faith in our justice system I believe that you know I know there's a few innocent people that slip through the cracks but for the most part if you're innocent you will be found innocent you know they can only put in prison if they have evidence and when you're innocent there is no evidence.
At the trial the reconstructed video images provided a chilling account of the murder.
The images were clear enough for a jury to look into Ronald Allen's eyes and see for themselves.
For me I went through a whole range of just wanting them to diet to.
One of them to take god only knows what it's now I'm kind of okay because I know life imprisonment to awfully great all we had was the video and you see in the video and if that's all you have.
Not feeling very good about your chances of ever resolving this case but because of the tips because of the work of radiant and future media and the interpretation of the abilities of Dr Sauer what we thought was nothing turned into a nothing could have made the case itself.
Ronald Allen was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.
A measure of justice made possible by old fashioned police work and the latest in forensic technology.
I really don't think Wanda's family knows how lucky they are that they got justice in this case.
It'S kind of ironic that the one thing that was supposed to make this easier for us turned out to be such a nightmare.
Business owners have to understand that if they're going to use security quick meant they have to buy good equipment they have to keep it clean use new video tapes and have good lighting so that we can get a good view of the suspect.
They all that to their employees to the police agencies and to the public I want people to know that one was a good person that was doing a job to take care of her family.
And she had she died for that she died for no reason no because in.
I am so glad around allowance in prison for the rest of his life the family of Wanda Mason probably doesn't know the blanks in the detail and the creativeness that went into this conviction but they don't have to know and it's not our position in law enforcement to go and tell people what a great job we've done our job people have elected me and the sheriff to protect they have elected us to to arrest criminals and they have elected me to do my best to convict them and protect the community that was done in this case and that's all that they need to know that's what our job is and we get our job.
