In the back woods of Georgia in a dilapidated house a forty nine year old recluse named Virginia Ridley was found dead.
A medical examiner ruled the death a homicide.
But who would murder someone who seldom ventured out of her home.
Investigators found some of those in the notes she had written shortly before her death.
Ringgold Georgia is a small rural town located at the base of the Blue Ridge mountains.
Life is simple here the main street has only three traffic lights and most of the towns seven hundred fifty residents no or do business with each other.
Alvin Ridley was a well known figure in Ringgold at one time he ran the town's only television repair shop.
In nineteen sixty six he married eighteen year old Virginia Hickey and almost immediately Virginia cut off all contact with her family.
Calvin said it was because her family was too intrusive.
Virginia sister Trixie lacroix says Alvin forced Virginia to stay away from her family I sent him an invitation to every wedding.
Every bar thing in our family.
To no avail nothing has ever acknowledged nothing my father's death.
My father went to his grave after making every effort possible to try to see his daughter.
Never having seen after.
In a mixed up with Mr Ridley.
Calvin Ridley had a reputation in Ringgold and it wasn't a particularly good one he was known for filing lawsuits against anyone he felt had wronged him and in the process he had made a lot of enemies is always accusing.
No one really.
So that obviously put him at odds with a lot of people city government licensing issues city chief of police of course the the county sheriff.
In nineteen eighty four after a minor traffic accident he filed a series of legal actions and got hit with the countersuit he lost and had to forfeit his van as payment July and not April.
The loss of his van meant the failure of this television repair business which started a further downward spiral.
He was known as crazy Alphand by the townspeople his reputation was not helped by the fact that no one had seen Alvin's wife Virginia not even her family in the thirty years she was married to out.
What I can understand if she was mad at her family why did she not go to the door for prince.
So I kind of made me the late that maybe possibly he had given instructions not.
He get angry.
At her maybe tell her not to and I the thought crossed my mind maybe she was being kept captive.
What went on in Alvin Ridley's secluded house was the subject of town gossip.
But on the morning of October fourth nineteen ninety seven it became news Virginia Ridley was found dead in her bed.
Fully closed by the time medical personnel arrived rigor mortis had said in an indication that she had been dead for at least eight hours.
Trixie lacroix was asked to identify her sister's body I could not do it I could not do it.
So my sister's husband was with her and she the two of them women and she came back out and she said.
You know I'm so glad you didn't go in it's was not a pretty sight.
She said her hair has not been combed in years.
It'S just it has so many not tenant.
It has not been calmed in years.
She can't away.
Ninety pounds she scans stretched over bone.
New rumors began to surface in Ringgold Georgia about Alvin Ridley and the role he might have played in his wife's death.
In October of nineteen ninety seven Virginia Ridley was found dead in a house with no phone no running water and infested with ants and cockroaches.
She had been dead at least eight hours before medical personnel arrived which prompted questions why had it taken her husband Alvin so long to call for help.
Virginia sister Trixie lacroix believes if he had called earlier for sister might still be alive there's no doubt in my mind that this man was responsible directly or indirectly from my sister's death you cannot convince me of anything.
Investigators traced Alvin steps on the morning of Virginia's death.
Alvin said that when he woke up his wife was dead he got into his truck and went looking for a telephone.
He admitted driving by the local fire station which could have provided emergency assistance.
Instead he continued driving to a telephone outside of town.
He did not call the local hospital ten minutes away instead he called a hospital in Chattanooga Tennessee some thirty miles away.
They told him to dial nine one one for local assistance which he finally did leaving this message.
No foundation there's no problem there investigators were struck by the lack of concern in Alison's voice it was unlike most emergency calls they receive.
The initial examination of Virginia's body was done by the local coroner Anita Hollander.
In Virginia's eyes the coroner found thirty kill hemorrhages which are broken blood vessels often seen in cases of strangulation or smothering deaths.
The scene is a female in her late forties deceit as malnourished number two is around.
The next day a full autopsy was performed the medical examiner Dr Frederick Hellman found something not noted during the initial examination deep bruising on the muscles of Virginia Ridley's neck another possible indication of strangulation.
Virginia Ridley's death was ruled a homicide and her husband Alvin was charged with murder.
To those in Ringgold who knew Alvin Ridley as crazy Alvin the news came as no surprise everybody thought he killed his wife back in the sixties.
By the early seventies there was even talk that he killed a long long time ago.
And then one day he called nine one one and there is a.
Recently a dead body in the bed.
And that's is why.
Because of the T. kill hemorrhages in the eyes and the condition of the body the coroner suspected foul play and police could find no indication that Virginia had received routine medical care in the recent past I think the check the fifty four hundred mile radius.
No pharmacy no hospital.
This girl had not been anywhere in thirty years.
The town of Ringgold was gearing up for the biggest trial in its history and investigators were in for another surprise when Calvin Ridley gave his explanation for how his wife died.
Trixie lacroix who regularly visits the grave of her sister a woman with whom she has more contact in death than she did in life.
That'S because Trixie and the rest of her family hadn't seen Virginia at all during the thirty years she lived with Alvin Ridley the man now accused of her murder.
I will say this that if there is a god almighty god Buck.
If there is a day of reckoning for all of this which I believe there is.
I would not want to be him.
Calvin Ridley steadfastly maintained his innocence.
We'Ve been married thirty years.
Alvin'S defense attorney McCracken Poston knew that the case against his client wouldn't be easy Alvin's reputation and behavior after his wife's death made his defense a unique challenge several members of my family just said he's crazy he's capable of anything.
I was about to get married and several members of my wife's family were fearful of not getting involved.
almond had developed for himself somewhat of a reputation as a panhandler a con man.
Poston visited Alvin's run down house on the edge of town and amid the cockroaches and broken windows saw something he hadn't expected the walls of the house were plastered with hand written notes.
Some more letters to Congress that album had written but I began to notice a distinct handwriting.
A simple Virginia.
And I grabbed a piece off the wall and you know set out in this save I've got to have all of this.
There were hundreds of notes all apparently in Virginia Ridley's handwriting.
Some dealt with everyday matters like what she had watched on television.
In notebooks and tire chapters of the Bible had been transcribed repeatedly most were love letters to Alvin.
Can post and did not believe the love notes for the writings of a woman being held against her will but could he prove to a jury that Virginia had actually written the notes.
Brian Carney a forensic document examiner analyzed the letters Carney had little to work with but he did have some known signatures of Virginia Ridley on some official documents written years earlier and he found a number of the unmistakable similarities.
The obvious features that you can see just at a glance R. for example the three eyes in Virginia's are very tall comparatively speaking their lower case letter forms cursive writing but they if you were to draw a horizontal line right across the top of this I all the way to the end of the name you would see that all of the eyes are taller than the other internal letterforms and you scan down through the series in comparison of question to known.
You can clearly see that the side feature.
As a habitual riding movement of this this particular writer and I was able to state that there were strong indications that Virginia was the rider of the compatible injuries so what we're essentially talking about is those letter combinations that have that are the same as the name Virginia and the signatures that have the given name Virginia.
Virginia'S family told investigators that Virginia suffered from epilepsy as a child.
Epilepsy is a neurological condition in which uncontrolled electrical charges from the cerebral cortex can result in violent seizures and convulsions.
According to her writings Virginia had stopped taking her epilepsy medication years relying instead on her faith in god to heal her.
The defense consultant Dr Braxton Wanamaker who is a neurologist he said the petite kill hemorrhages around Virginia's eyes were consistent with what is called sudden death epilepsy.
Dr wanna maker says sudden death epilepsy occurs in patients who stopped taking their medication or haven't been properly diagnosed I've had other patients who are sleeping with their spouses and they wake up and find that their spouses dad so people may or may not witness the seizure and there are some of us who are not certain that all of these deaths are associated with seizure per se.
But may have some couple uptick activity in the brain that changes heart rhythms heart changes respiratory mechanisms such that people die from that Alvan Ridley said his wife had seizures on a regular basis he said she had a particularly bad one on the night before she died if you had a safe and got away with it this is a.
Are you gonna be all right.
And she smiled at miss it is time hello.
But according to Alvin she was dead when he tried to wake her the next day.
Alben said the seizures were the reason no one had seen Virginia in all those years she was so embarrassed about his seizures she wanted no contact with the outside world not even her family.
But the defense had one last hurdle how to explain the bruising on Virginia Ridley snack evidence that the medical examiner said pointed to homicide.
Judge Ralph van pelt presided over Alvin Ridley's murder trial and immediately had him evaluated by a psychologist he certainly probably will qualify I think for mentally ill under the Georgia statute but that's only if you're found guilty but mentally ill the size of the site the report indicated that he was competent to stand trial could assist his attorney and the defense knew right from wrong.
At the trial Alvin's defense team needed to refute the prosecution's contention that the bruises on Virginia Ridley snack what evidence of strangulation.
Dr Robert Goldberg a forensic pathologist hired by the defense discovered that an employee in the coroner's office had drawn blood from Virginia Ridley snack for a toxicology test which was a complete break from standard procedure.
This is highly irregular and it is something that procedurally.
When the autopsy was conducted the next day doctor Goldberg believes the needle marks had developed into bruises which are known as artifact term for any changes in the body caused by post mortem evaluation.
I think it would be absolutely essential that any corner.
Have some autopsy experience even if they don't conduct the autopsy themselves they should know that appropriate procedures.
It was clear to me that this corner was way our way out of line with appropriate procedure.
In Georgia the coroner is an elected official and this was the first suspicious death Anita Hollinger investigated after her election.
Alvin'S attorney believes that the coroner's in experience and their own personal suspicions about Calvin Ridley affected her judgment when that body went to the state crime lab.
And she accompanied it.
She reported when they arrived this woman has been locked in a basement for thirty years.
St anthologised that conducted the autopsy.
I think that was an improper suggestion.
Based on no fact.
That made it easy for him to come close homicide asphyxiation.
Alvin Ridley took the stand in his own defense he said he drove by the local fire station after his wife's death because he had had a prior run in with the people there and didn't trust them.
He said he called the hospital in Chattanooga because that's where he taken his mother years earlier it was the only facility he was familiar with.
After two hours of deliberation.
A jury acquitted Alvin Ridley of all charges.
He claims it was his wife Virginia testifying through her letters kept him from a life behind bars.
Alvin Ridley still lives in the same dilapidated home on the outskirts of town.
And still talks about restarting his television repair business.
He visits Virginia's grave regularly.
The ledge he enjoys because of the role science played in proving his innocence.
I guess he was a strange way I understood him to be her with.
I understood him not to have the social skills.
That the rest of society has.
And unfortunately I believe that had a great deal to do with the fact that he was tried.
If it hadn't been for this scientific evidence.
The risk was so high that the local.
Community prejudices and biases about Alvin Ridley and his.
Years and years of strange behavior would have been difficult to overcome.
I think it's a story about how the system works.
That someone has their right to make state proves that they're guilty prove that they did it beyond a reasonable doubt.
And a fellow with just the very modest resources was able to come in and.
Is that he was not able to establish that he was not guilty.
