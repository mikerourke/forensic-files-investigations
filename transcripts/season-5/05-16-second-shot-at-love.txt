Cincinnati heart surgeon Dr Darrell said Tory is had a second chance at love when he married a pretty young divorce say what happiness is sometimes elusive doctors the Tories fell into a serious depression.
And apparently committed suicide with a thirty eight caliber pistol.
Why did he fire a test shot into the sofa cushion before killing himself.
Cincinnati Ohio the sixth largest city in the United States because of its size and sophistication it's health care facilities are among the finest anywhere.
Dr Darrell said Tory is was one of the city's most successful and respected heart surgeons but he was also impatient and demanding doctors the Taurus was a very busy surgeon but he didn't have the strongest people skills.
He was perceived by many of his co workers is very cross angry kind of difficult to please sort of man.
Dr satori is met his wife Janet was a nurse at the same hospital.
Apple had four children together three daughters and a son.
And it wasn't long before Janet realized the many challenges of being married to a busy doctor he was in solo practice which.
Who took up all of his time he was on call all of the time he chose to do that and he was doing very well but it wasn't easy and he was always worried that his his last referral would be his last referral.
The hard work and sacrifice paid off by the mid nineteen eighties doctors a Taurus was earning three hundred thousand dollars a year.
But the climb to the top of his profession came with a price.
The marriage was strained due to long hours pressure and Daryl's explosive temper.
He was almost dangerous he could put you down you can make you feel really bad about yourself.
And and he would he he would do it and.
And sometimes to the children he like to be in control and he'd like to be in charge and he'd like to be a provider and a caretaker and while we enjoyed some of that.
We weren't totally wanting to be controlled or taken care of and that bothered him I think I was a little too independent for him after thirty years of marriage the couple divorced.
Dr satori is was lonely depressed and overweight and had a difficult time living apart from his children.
He was interested in finding a woman I think who didn't challenge him much who would tell him how wonderful he was and stroke his ego so to speak for companionship satori has turned to a dating service.
Dating services are a big business in the United States for a fee clients provide their picture and personal information which the service distributed to other clients the dating service thought doctor satori is ten forty five year old Dante Britain would make a good match ms Britain described herself as the owner of a day care facility who had recently been divorced.
She was cute.
I you know perfect size.
Two I'm very petite.
I'M she was able to give off the air of I am a catch which is very important to a mate yes I'm looking for a mate.
After four months of dating Dr satori as and Dante were married it looked as if Daryl was moving on with his life but soon his new wife noticed problems he was very nice very kind but he was so depressed and along with depression Donte discovered that Darryl was impotent is embarrassed tell me when he wasn't I guess quite sure have I taken.
Canada has just said just I just want to keep give me lots of hugs and lots of kisses on the cheek and.
No I just keep holding my.
Dr satori as was so depressed that he spoke of committing suicide to some of his colleagues.
Part of the problem with some startling secrets he found out about his new wife.
After doctors said Tory is merry Dante Britain the couple moved into a luxurious home in an upscale Cincinnati suburb.
Dante rubbish the lifestyle that her husband's income could provide she finally had her wish you know she had fur coats made she had Jaguars she had Lexus she had she think she wanted she went as far as your agent Caribbean she went on holidays.
Really that's what she seem to always want was that perfect lifestyle but from the start the marriage was in trouble.
Doctors a Taurus was suffering from depression impotence and the couple fought often about money and who controls the purse strings.
In general I am so happy for you.
Wherever you want the wedding reception is fine don't worry about the cost down there's been a terrible argument when Dante learn Daryl was going to pay for his daughter's wedding.
So much money on your kids the way.
Dante resented spending money on Daryl's children.
If he were to buy something for the children she would retaliate by going out and buying designer clothes furs jewelry running at the credit card bill basically in retaliation for him paying attention to his own children Dante's behavior prompted to Tory is to look into his wife's background he found out that much of what Donte had told him were lies.
Her real name was down the hall she never graduated from UCLA and she had claimed in fact she hadn't finished high school.
And she had lied about how many times she had been married Dr city areas was Dallas fifth husband she was the type of person who had to have the last word who would often go out of a relationship with the bank so to speak and satori is discovered his new wife had a long history of violence.
She'S written house number four with a gun she threatened husband number three with a knife she.
One guy the common law husband she actually lit his bed on fire drug ten and it has been on fire he woke up in a burning that he lived through it.
Thank god there were rumors that she had.
Previous boyfriends and possibly another husband and California we spent quite a bit of time working with the Los Angeles homicide squad who were very cooperative and tracked down several leads force but were never able to identify a previous boyfriend or husband.
In southern California that.
Was not currently alive.
This is the Tories had also been convicted of threatening and earlier husband with the gun and incident that terrified Daryl's I spoke to one of his colleagues for another's heart surgeon in Cincinnati about this and he said there are came into work one day wearing bullet proof vests.
And the other surgeon could not believe it he said you know what he's talking about.
And you're all set well you know I I I'm sure I'm fearful for my life and.
I'M wearing a bullet proof vest and he he admitted to it.
Officer I need your help after learning the truth about his new wife Dr satori has stopped a local policeman at a gas station he handed the policeman a handgun belonging to his wife and asked him to take it because he feared for his life.
The policeman noted the doctors the Tory S. seemed disoriented.
Dr satori is next stop was his lawyer's office although the marriage was only ten months old the Tories wanted his wife cut out of his will he also began divorce proceedings.
By this time the couple no longer slept together he spent most of his time in the basement and days would go by without the two of them seeing one another.
On Monday morning February nineteenth nineteen ninety six Dr satori is didn't show up for work and didn't answer his pages his nurse called nine one one.
When police arrived at the satori is home.
Police asked to search the home.
Doctors say Tories this car was in the garage.
In the basement they found Dr satori is dead of a gunshot wound to the head.
Thirty eight caliber pistol.
It hit the appearances of a suicide there was a gunshot wound to the side of the head the gun was relatively close to the body.
The blood was completely dry and rigor mortis had said in an indication that he had been dead for at least a day or two.
It appeared that satori as had been drinking and watching television when he fired the fatal shot well I knew that he was certainly suicidal his lawyer thought that he was suicidal and that there had been a chance that it had been set aside.
The thirty eight caliber pistol used in doctors to Torres's death was registered to Mississippi yes I picked it up from the store just twenty four hours before he was killed.
First impressions indicated the doctors the Taurus is death was suicide.
He was depressed on anti depressant medication and he told friends he was considering suicide.
Mississippi toria said she didn't hear any gunshots from the basement but the next door neighbors heard a loud bang from the satori is home sometime after midnight on Saturday.
When forensic experts arrived at the scene they immediately saw other inconsistencies two shots had been fired.
One into the sofa cushion.
The other to the head.
It is not uncommon at all for the person who is going to use this firearm to take their own life to test fire the weapon first to make sure they know how to use the use the weapon the bullet entered just above the right ear and there was no exit wound.
Blood was expelled from satori as his mouth and nose.
But there was blood spatter on doctors to Tories as left arm as well as both sides of his right hand.
It appeared that satori is his right arm was in his lap at the time of the fatal shot and not behind his head holding the gun.
Off of this was blood found on doctors to Tory this is right pond if doctors to Tory is shot himself the handle of the gun would have prevented blood spatter from hitting his palm when the shot was fired.
The job listings that are present on the the Palmer surface of the right hand of doctor stories represent the exhalation of blood after injury and these are distributed over quite a wide area.
But it also indicates that the hand that is the right hand was very close to the face and indicates to me that the hand was moved after the exhalation of blood occurred.
He'S got a problem with this man if there was a Taurus fired the fatal shot at himself his hand would have been back here at the time and not in a position to receive the blood spatter another discrepancy blood on the front of the sofa in front of the body.
This book couldn't have come from him and then hitting the front of the couch at let's say a forty degree angle this has been like falling off of somebody's hands finally there was the second bullet fired at the scene it was possible the doctors the Tories test fired the weapon before firing the fatal shot into his hand but the powder burns on doctors to Tories as right hand and on the sofa we're on top of the block.
Which meant the blood was there first before the second shot was fired doctors a Tory is most likely.
would would not have been able to fire that shot himself it was done by someone else it is most logical that the hand was moved.
to an area where the second shot was fired in an attempt to produce perhaps gunshot residue on the hands.
Of the victim which would then be in the mind of the shooter make this appear more like a suicide and homicide.
This is a Tory S. was the only other person in the house when Darryl died.
But what was her motive for murder.
She had a one million dollar motive she wanted that money.
He had a pension plan that her she was entitled to as his wife if Daryl had divorced her Mississippi Tories would have only received an allowance of between one and two thousand dollars a month.
A million dollars is a powerful motive for murder.
But perhaps the most damaging piece of information was what Dallas mother told police that his mom was on the phone calls the hill okay sheriff's office in assures them.
They'Re also Taurus did not commit suicide.
Murdered and guarantees that her daughter is the one that committed the offense.
LFA hall also known as Donte Britain was arrested and charged with murder in the shooting death of her husband Darrell said Korea's defense suggested the killer was loose in the neighborhood since our neighbor was brutally murdered a few blocks away three days after the Tories is death.
There were no signs of forced entry in the satori is home and prosecutors were convinced that the forensic evidence and motive clearly pointed to Mississippi Taurus.
Around two o'clock in the morning Dr satori is was on the sofa in the basement watching television.
His wife approach from behind with a thirty eight caliber pistol.
She fired a fatal shot.
Blood from his nose and mouth spattered over his right palm evidence that he was not holding the gun when it was fired.
Download then placed the gun in his hand and fired the second shot to make sure gun powder residue would be found on his hands.
But the blood on his palm showed otherwise as did the powder burns on the sofa cushions which were also on top of the blood stains.
During the murder blood got hunter Douglas hand which she tried to shake off the blood hit the sofa from the front at a forty five degree angle.
And in moving.
And and putting it the gun into it she committed some very fatal flaws to her defense that this was a suicide you now have blood.
She got blood on her hands are kind of flung it back now you've got blood spatter.
On the couch coming from the wrong direction.
And there is no scientific way to explain that from a suicide position so she's got that prop she's got blood going the wrong direction on the couch she's got an arm where it shouldn't be she's got blood on both sides of his hands where it shouldn't be and she's got smeared born on a farm where it shouldn't be.
Although doctors the Tories his death may have appeared to be suicide the forensic evidence clearly pointed to murder.
During the trial the voice of doctors the Tories himself was heard in the courtroom a message to his daughter left on her answering machine.
You could hear the fear in his voice that you know she's threatening to kill me I'm afraid she's going to follow through on this you know I may not live through this please don't push this right now.
A Cincinnati jury deliberated for just over four hours before delivering the verdict.
She was sentenced to life in prison and won't be eligible for parole until two thousand fourteen.
Well you know what I would prefer to see delegate to death only answer whatever I think that what you did was terrible there was really an overwhelming amount of of blood evidence here to indicate that this was a staged scene and to this day I I don't know what the R. what does thinking.
That she was going to be able to get away with because the evidence there was just too much evidence there.
Her own mother calls her a Black Widow spider.
The mother characterizes her as a fortune hunter who found her way to success by latching on to a successful man noted crime writer Aphrodite E. Jones interviewed della imprisoned for her best selling book Dallas when.
Jones believes that wind down heard about her husband's divorce plans delek concluded.
That murder was our only alternative.
Absolutely dell is a born killer she is a born sociopath she is somebody who said it views the world.
Through her eyes only which doesn't add up with the reality the consensus of reality in the rest of the world in her eyes the world is her oyster for the taking and she can't take it so find a way to take it there is no earning anything there is no justification for anything it's just all about.
Satori as family cannot easily forget the years stolen from through a senseless irrational act of betrayal.
She has a wonderful children who are very compilation educated and he would be very proud of them he now has two son in laws and two grandchildren whom I think he would have adored would have loved to have spent time with and I think he would have come into his own in this part of his life where he had accomplished what he had set out to do and he could sit back and enjoy his accomplishments certainly with his children and I'm very sad that he was not allowed to enjoy that and I miss him we are missing a lot.
