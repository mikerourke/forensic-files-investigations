In nineteen ninety six a suspicious house fire destroyed the home of the Seattle Washington policeman in a bizarre twist an ex convict confessed to setting the fire then mysteriously disappeared.
When investigators look carefully at the written confession they discovered clues of a more serious crime than arson they found evidence of murder.
Sergeant Matt Bach Meyer was a twenty five year veteran of the king county sheriff's department a man well liked and respected by his peers this guy was please hero you know he had been involved in several different types of shoot outs are real interesting type of events and had survived the.
On July ninth nineteen ninety six at one thirty in the morning a fire broke out in sergeant Bach Myers suburban home.
Bach Meyer was at a local bowling alley when the fire broke out.
By the time the fire was extinguished the home was almost completely destroyed.
The all region of the fire appeared suspicious and dogs specially trained to recognize flammable liquids or excel runs were sent to sniff through the rubble.
The dogs identified five different areas where IT salaries were used to set this fire one was in the basement.
A second in the dining room.
There were two separate areas in the attic.
And the fifth was in the garage.
In arson terms this is called a layering fire.
On the outside wall of sergeant Bach Myers garage were spray painted messages critical of police one said Rios lives.
What a loop Rios was a man sergeant Bach Meyer had shot and killed eight years earlier in the line of duty.
Oct Meyer told colleagues that he had received threats from Rios as friends and relatives but until now they had only been threats.
Captain Dave Merrin was sergeant Bach Meyer supervisor.
We'Re concerned any time tell us your home is is arson that's a dramatic event for them and I talked about what he might need as a way of help and support and time off to recover from that.
While the arson investigation continued sergeant Bach Meyer himself uncovered some important information about the fire.
It happened when he was called to break up the neighborhood fight you okay.
One of the men in that fight was Brad rand who had a history of mental problems and had some prior brushes with the law.
Two weeks ago he was shot in the leg and that's not going to play with his brothers his roommate's brother.
Certainly kill me but I guess it's going to be far let's get down to the police station you take your statement there.
Sergeant Bach Meyer asked rand to come to the police station so that he could take a statement.
According to sergeant Bach Meyer during questioning ran asked Bach Meyer refused the cop whose home was destroyed by the recent fire he's a cult that had his house burned down.
Yeah why when Bach Meyer said yes rent allegedly told Bach Meyer that he knew the identity of the arsonist the drug dealer I met in the bar.
B. Hernandez told ran at a local cop had stolen some drugs and money from him during a recent drug bust Hey man this couple is to me the other day.
Nope I'll give you five hundred Bucks to come and help.
The cop Fernandez was talking about was none other than sergeant Bach Meyer.
So I said okay.
I couldn't find the drugs or the money.
Have you started stealing.
I heard him say he was going to burn your house down.
Where is he now.
I think I'm going to help you find him you're crazy to kill me.
When I left he was pissed and I'm glad he's gone.
Sergeant Bach Meyer transcribe ren's entire statement had ran sign it then released him from custody but mark Meyer had a dilemma the confession implicated him in the theft of drugs and money so he decided not to turn it over to his superiors at least not yet.
Brad ran the man who allegedly confessed to taking part in the arson of sergeant Matt Bach Myers home had a history of mental problems.
It all started when Brad ran was in the Air Force he was in a severe motorcycle accident and barely escaped with his life he had massive brain injuries.
They didn't know we went in a comma they didn't know.
Ran eventually recovered but he was never the same after the accident his personality changed he was more aggressive and for the first time in his life got into trouble with the law shortly after the accident he was convicted of a sex related offense and spent three months in prison.
More recently ran was in a violent argument with his roommate and Marcel who shot him in the leg shattering his tibia his roommate had a mental problem too and if you didn't take his medication was then.
And get daily you down off his medication for a while and.
N. Brad Pitt and its finger with the hammer.
Unaware of Brad rains alleged confession arson investigator Becky Gibbs was assigned to investigate the arson fire at sergeant Bach Myers home.
She saw evidence that was inconsistent with the fire set for revenge and typically if somebody's gonna set a fire for revenge they may go to some trouble to set a fire but this particular way of setting a fire take some time.
The debris from the fire was analyzed using gas chromatography which found traces of gasoline in the debris.
There was also evidence that road flares were used to ignite the gasoline this would be considered a time delay device he said the road flare on fire the fire doesn't start right away but once it reaches the point where it's touching the gas container van the fire the gas container would melt in the fireworks start.
Most fires set for revenge do not use time delay devices.
The flares would have given sergeant Bach Meyer another time to drive to the bowling alley to establish his alibi before the gasoline containers exploded.
Investigators were also suspicious because Bach Myers artwork porcelain collection and bowling trophies were found undamaged in his backyard shed after the fire.
Sergeant Bach Meyer became the prime suspect he adamantly denied any involvement but when asked to take a lie detector test he refused under increasing scrutiny sergeant Bach Meyer had no choice but to produce Brad rains alleged confession even though it implicated Bach Meyer in stealing from the reputed drug dealers.
When police tried to interview Brad ran to corroborate his confession they discovered he was missing was name is close none of these shoes nothing left in the house.
He would never went up leftist Doug with nobody taking care of.
He would have never.
He lived just never left them like that.
Detective Danny Gould asked Matt Bach Meyer if he knew anything about rand's disappearance since Bach Meyer was the last known person to see ran a live search laughing as well if you find a dead with my business card nailed to his forehead you know to come talk to any kind of laughs it off kind of jokingly and you know riff that down when he says that because I'm going that's kind of bizarre.
Police could find no arrest record for anyone by the name of the Hernandez and police officials say Bach Myers handling of bread rains interrogation was improper it would be highly highly unusual for a experienced police sergeant twenty five years to take a statement like that a loan from a suspect.
And then certainly to release him immediately afterwards would be.
extremely extremely rare.
Although Brad rand's family identified the signature on the bottom of the alleged confession as Brad's forensic document examiners weren't entirely convinced.
In Seattle Washington police were conducting two simultaneous investigations one into the fire that destroyed a police sergeant Matt Bach Myers home the other a search for the whereabouts of Brad ran.
They were connected since Brad ran was last seen alive in the backseat of sergeant Bach Myers patrol car.
It was the last sighting we had in in police investigations the last person seen with someone who's alive is certainly going to track your interest.
The four and a half page statement in which Brad ran allegedly admitted to taking part in the arson of sergeant Bach Myers home was written by Bach Meyer ban signed by Iran which is standard procedure Brad ran had signed the first four pages of the confession but for some unexplained reason did not sign the last page in our department that's not normal it's not a normal procedure would write the whole statement the very last page would have that on the confession was subjected to a process known as video spect ta graffiti to the naked eye the end can rand's confession all look the same.
But the video spec tiger feet told a different story under various infrared light sources scientists could see that the confession was written with three different banks.
All of rain signatures and his initials were written in a black ink with high luminescence the entire first page at the top of the second use of gray black tank with media and luminescence from then on a third and was used a black tank the chosen no reaction to the infrared light and there were other discrepancies ren's occupation was listed as truck driver which was incorrect as well as other vital information James Rhodes birthdate was different on the second page is listed as nineteen seventy one and then on the third and fourth pages nineteen sixty one and then the fifth page doesn't even have a birth date in the confession Bach Meyer incorrectly wrote the contraction for you R. as Y. O. U. R. the same mistake found in the threatening message John Sargent Bach Myers garage after the fire.
Next scientists check Bach Myers patrol car and found something unusual yes I go to the backseat of partners control car the fine.
just very faint traces of blood in nationally they thought well this place car.
It'S not gonna be unusual to have faint traces of blood in the backseat of a police car they open up the seat and they find in the stitching several bloodstain patterns on the backside of the seat cover that had soaked through the stitching.
Using a sample of blood from Brad rains parents are reversed paternity DNA test was made it proved conclusively that the blood from the backseat of the patrol car was that of brand ran.
Can anybody or tell me what happened Bach Meyer said the blood was from rand's bloody nose that occurred in the fight Bach Meyer was called to break up.
Investigators decided to test this hypothesis to see if the size of the blood stain was consistent with the nose bleed forensic scientist used identical rear seats from other patrol cars to conduct their test using head sculptures with wigs and waits to simulate a human head investigators pored different amounts of blood on to the seat cushions it took two quarts of blood to produce a stain the size found in Bach Myers patrol car.
A loss of two quarts of blood would be life threatening.
Police also found Brad rand's blood on a pair of sergeant Bach Myers work shoes.
Investigators now believe the bread rand died in the backseat of sergeant Bob Myers patrol car.
Seven months after Brad rans disappearance hikers in a restricted area of cougar mountain park outside of Seattle found some bones and what appeared to be a human skull.
The bones had been scattered by animals fragments were found over a quarter mile away.
Only twenty percent of the skeleton was recovered but the size and shape of the cranium told forensic anthropologist that the victim was male and that the condition of the bones indicated they had been in the park less than a year they also found a steel rod in the lower leg bone a surgical repair identical to one performed on Brad ran and near some of the bones in the park searchers found a red white and blue leg cast witnesses said Brad ran was wearing an identical leg cast when he left with sergeant Bach Meyer in his patrol car.
Tomorrow in one of the bones was tested for DNA and the results confirmed what investigators already suspected the bone was that of Brad ran.
But I was glad a lot of ways they found.
The only remaining question for investigators was the motive the story is so convoluted and so.
Sort of pathetically obvious in its fabrication that it almost defies belief I mean I think would be rejected as a plot for a novel or script for a movie because it just seems so absurd and outlandish an unnecessarily sort of complex and contradictory.
Matt Bach Meyer was an avid bowler and his dream was to compete on the professional bowlers tour.
Prosecutors believe Bach Meyer set fire to his own home using the time delay device giving him time to get to the bowling alley to establish his alibi Bach Meyer may have planned to use the insurance money from the fire to finance his entry on to the pro boulder store.
But removing his bowling trophies and artwork from the home before the fire was a classic Farson mistake when Bach Meyer learned he was a suspect in the arson he look for a scapegoat.
Brad ran was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
There is no evidence he ever made it to police headquarters for questioning somewhere along the way Bach Meyer stopped his car and forced or coerced ran into signing some blank police reports I'm not gonna bother taking it out of the station.
I just read the report from what you already told me.
There be no charges.
Is this something you normally do.
Hey do me a favor your statement goes on too long to decide if you want to copy for sure.
Rains blood seeped into the rear seat cushions as Bach Meyer made the thirty minute drive mountain park to dump the body.
Some time later Bach Meyer composed the phony confession which forensic technology revealed as bogus I never been so mad at somebody in my whole life.
I was just curious with that man.
I think the man must have a mental problems I'm I don't know.
I keep feature.
Twenty five years or so.
Doing something like this without having some kind of a problem.
What what what was you gonna gain out of it you know.
I don't know.
Sergeant Matt Bach Meyer was convicted of first degree murder he was sentenced to life in prison.
Seattle prosecutors say it was one of the most bizarre murder cases they had ever encountered.
I can't pretend to to tell you.
What sort of a person gets drawn into a web of his own making to the extent he's willing to take a human life all I can say is that we see this happen and.
We rarely see it happen with a law enforcement officer with twenty five years of service but most murders are fundamentally inexplicable unreasonable irrational events I think.
Stupid reply but I think.
The thing that comes to mind is just.
The people that work around him one of our members was.
Talking not too long ago but someone writing a book about this and they said.
I don't think anybody will write a book about this because when you tell the story it's not believable.
but it is interesting and so I think it's still for for quite some time to come will will be with our department unfortunately.
