In nineteen eighty seven a mother and her two young daughters were brutally murdered in their apartment in anchorage Alaska microscopic clues from inside the apartment identified a family relative as a possible suspect.
But how good investigators tell whether the evidence was fresh or had been there since long before the murders.
Anchorage Alaska is considered one of the most scenic cities in the United States.
Bordered by the Alaska mountain range on one side and the Pacific Ocean on the other it draws tens of thousands of tourists each year.
The life blood of the state had been the oil business.
But in the mid nineteen eighties prices for crude oil crash forcing thousands of workers off the job.
John Newman was one of the oil workers who lost his job when he couldn't find other work in Alaska he left for California to take classes to become a locksmith his wife Nancy stayed behind to care for their two young daughters eight year old Melissa and three year old Angie Angie was the chair of beautiful blonde hair just cute.
Melissa was at that stage where she wasn't baby cute anymore.
But she had all the potential to be beautiful.
Nancy worked as a waitress at Wendy's restaurant in anchorage landmark.
She was known for never missing a day and when she didn't come to work one Sunday morning her co workers were concerned Nancy sister Cheryl worked for us as a hostess and.
They were very very close.
And I said Cheryl you know you got your car can you run over and check on Nancy see what's going on.
Cheryl immediately drove over to her sister's apartment Nancy Newman's front door was locked but inside was a scene of horrific violence Nancy was found in her bedroom she had been sexually assaulted and strangled to death with a pillowcase eight year old Melissa.
I had met the same fate three year old and she.
I bled to death after her throat was slashed we never had a Cramlington town for you know a whole family basically kill him.
In her own house on I was very.
The coroner estimated the murders took place sometime on Saturday morning none of the neighbors saw or heard anything unusual during that time.
Although there were no signs of forced entry Nancy Newman's camera and purse were missing from the apartment a knife was also missing from a butcher block in the kitchen cookie ten normally held Nancy's waitressing tips was empty on the kitchen table a damp wash rag was found in the bathroom sink he wasn't a controversial inside their apartment he.
The situation of these victims enough to know that he wouldn't.
In all likelihood be interrupted that he could spend a significant amount of time and we can tell he's finishing at the long time had three of the victims three different bedrooms to sexually assaulted.
And then we had the person completely cleaning up he would have to be covered with blood John Newman was attending school in California.
These could find no evidence that he had returned to Alaska at the time of the murders and was not considered a suspect but the killings reflected a great rage on the part of the perpetrator.
Police wondered if Nancy Newman had made an enemy among co workers or customers of the restaurant.
It was a difficult station that she worked it was normally you know single guys and maybe they were hung over maybe they were just being jerks as John Newman returned home to bury his wife and two small children investigators wondered whether this was a botched robbery attempt that had turned violent or.
An act of revenge.
After the murders of Nancy Newman and her two daughters Melissa and Dan J. anchorage residents feared that a random sex killer was on the loose I didn't somebody here Nancy screens.
Step three that night I could hear a woman screaming.
It would be you know when you first fall asleep and I'd wake up and I'd still hear the screams.
And for a while I didn't know if it was dreams if it was really happening.
Who in this community would commit such a crime where they would actually kill two young children like that and if a witness who wasn't a husband and who and who is he still out there on the streets and that had a lot of people who are genuinely scared.
The lack of forced entry on the time spent in the apartment led investigators to believe the killer had been there before yes the worst case that I've worked at.
I'Ve been involved in one form or another over two hundred homicide investigations and this would be the worst as far as the victims go the brutality of the age.
What was done to them.
The crime scene investigators search for fingerprints using a technique called super glue fuming when super glue is heated the fumes attached to the biological material and finger oils Dan powder is used to reveal the print sometimes you'll be able to see them sometimes you will not after the supergroup showing process is completed as a fingerprint examiner once those fingerprints are fixed well either photograph amassed they develop or add different chemicals to that item to try to make the fingerprints visible so that we can preserve them and comparing two suspects or other individuals Kathy mon Frida found over one hundred fingerprints in the apartment many did not belong to anyone in the immediate family these prints were found on the inside of the front door on the cookie.
Where Nancy Newman kept her waitressing tips in the bathroom.
And in other areas investigators identified the princess those of Kirby and a nephew of the Newman family Anthony was a twenty three year old drifter who had recently moved to anchorage from Idaho since he needed a place to stay the Newmans allowed him to move and temporarily.
He had lived there with them they had let him stay there there's a relatively felt sorry for him I knew it had a troubled past and so he had a legitimate reason for being in there which means a lot to what we're going to discover and trace evidence they put him up he stayed with them he got it and I think they got along okay although we did hear later learned that he didn't get along real well with Melissa the eight year old.
beat Anthony admitted that living in a small apartment with two young children was difficult and he told police he moved out amicably just two weeks before the murders.
Furthermore Kirby Anthony denied any knowledge of the attack and said he had an alibi.
He told police he was out with friends on Friday night and spent Saturday morning eating breakfast at a Burger King restaurant.
In addition to the fingerprints investigators found large amounts of hair in almost every room of the Newman's apartment the hairs were Caucasian and we're not similar to anyone in the Newman family.
Anchorage police sent the hairs to the F. B. I. in Washington DC hoping they could shed some light on the identity of the killer.
At FBI headquarters in Washington DC analysts Doug deedrick examined all of the hairs and fibers collected from the Newman's apartment there were thousands of hairs and fibers throughout the apartment which is not unusual.
But Diedrich found large numbers of hairs in the victim's bedrooms which were cubic.
It is very easy to distinguish the differences between ahead here and a pubic hair differences being in diameter length color internal microscopic characteristics the appearance of the tip of the carriage generally have a pointed tip resident here's are often cut.
His first task was to compare the hairs to the victims and to their prime suspect Kirby Anthony.
The pubic hairs were microscopically similar to hear samples collected from Kirby Anthony.
But Anthony's hairs in the apartment could be explained since he had been living there until ten days before the murders.
The question was.
When were these hairs left in the apartment.
To find out Doug deedrick devised a unique experiment I had to take a vacuum home I had to vacuum the houses I don't believe the house is ever been any cleaner.
but every every night for two weeks I vacuumed and and then compared afterwards to see what types of errors I found in how many hairs I found.
Deedrick discovered the pubic hairs can travel or migrate from room to room and the way that happens in a household is through what is called a secondary transfer.
You B. cares travel from room to room primarily on the socks the D. Drake experiment revealed that these transfers were limited very few pubic hairs from an adult's bedroom migrate into a child's bedroom.
How then to account for the large number of Kirby Anthony's pubic hair is in the children's rooms one explanation was that Anthony was in the girl's bedroom nude or on covered.
In addition all of the pubic hairs found in these rooms were clean and moist.
If the hairs had been there since the time Anthony was living there the shaft would have been try and collected dirt when I hear is deposited it especially on the floor in the carpet of the residents over time the hair can exhibit chew marks from beetle larva that tend to eat on the hairs on the hairs will accumulate dirt or debris on the surface the hairs that were found on the body of Melissa and on Angie all three of those here is P. B. cares like Kirby Anthony's did not have any dirt on the actually it would look like fresh blood on the surface of the ears and that I thought was very significant next deedrick examined the damp wash rag found in the Newman St after the murders on the wash rag person green wool fibers which matched a pair of gloves found in Nancy Newman's bedroom.
Also on the wash rag for traces of the victim's blood.
Finally Dietrich made a startling discovery on the wash rag where the care is with partial egg casings from pubic lice and extremely rare finding the hairs were microscopically similar to Kirby Anthony and investigators discovered that Anthony had recently been treated for pubic lice and there was more evidence linking Kirby Anthony to the Newman crime scene.
One was the location of Kirby Anthony's palm print in a particularly unusual location available this is bad on the wall.
An entire of left hand print was developed.
Melissa had been sexually assaulted the print only ten inches above her head was telling.
Anthony'S fingerprints were also found on the container that Nancy Newman used to hold the cash tips from the restaurant.
Kirby Anthony's roommate told police that on the morning of the murders Anthony had walked into their apartment with blood on his clothing and immediately washed everything he was wearing.
The roommate also revealed that Anthony was counting a large amount of change later that same day.
Police were still missing two important pieces of evidence the murder weapon and automotive.
As the investigation into the murders of Nancy Newman and her two daughters continued more and more evidence pointed to the Newman's nephew Kirby Anthony.
When the anchorage police search for a motive they learned that Kirby Anthony's departure from the Newman apartment was not as amicable as he first admitted.
John Kirby is making.
Now he's John Newman told police that his wife had called him in California she said Anthony was behaving inappropriately and on at least one occasion had struck the children Kerr is acting inappropriately start to physically discipline the girls get angry at him.
Police believe that it was an angry Kirby Anthony who moved into this dilapidated apartment just ten days before the murders.
Investigators had one last piece of physical evidence to examine the vacuum cleaner Nancy Newman use to clean her apartment a neighbor told police Nancy Newman vacuumed her apartment shortly before the murders I wouldn't collar exactly a clean freak not obsessively clean freak but for somebody with two little kids and then I had two little kids it was a very neat well ordered place.
When Dr Dietrich looked inside the vacuum cleaner bag he saw many separate layers of dirt each layer was different.
The top layer was the most recent layer of dirt in it deedrick could find only one pubic hair from Kirby Anthony the absence of Kirby Anthony's pubic hairs in the top layer of dirt in the vacuum bag along with the presence of a great deal of his pubic hair at the murder scene indicated that Kirby Anthony had been inside the apartment between the time it was a last vacuumed and the time of the murders occurred today.
Run over him with the car.
It'S just whatever.
And you know that that would ruin my life.
This man has scored so many people.
What he did to Nancy in the girls but fun thank.
Prosecutors believe that the microscopic trail of evidence Kirby Anthony left behind clearly shows his path on the morning of the murders the theory was that Anthony was angry after he was forced to vacate the Newman's apartment and sought revenge.
The night before the merger is friends said Kirby was using cocaine and alcohol.
The next morning.
Anthony entered the Newman's apartment.
The children were sent to their rooms.
Not at some point Anthony grabbed a kitchen knife and forced Nancy Newman into our bedroom.
Wearing wool gloves he found in the bedroom he raped and strangled Nancy Newman with a pillowcase.
Then he entered Melissa's bedroom assaulting and killing her to leaving his palm print above her bed.
The evidence suggests Anthony cleaned himself in the bathroom leaving the damp washcloth complete with his pubic hair lice the green wool fibers and the victim's blood in the sink.
He then killed three year old Angie the only remaining person who could place him at the scene.
He also took Nancy's purse camera and the knife he used in the murders.
The person the knife were never recovered the camera was later found in his possession.
The crime of opportunity careers very disorganized killer he just.
Walked over there for whatever reason.
became out of control and continue down this path to destruction.
At the trial Kirby Anthony pleaded not guilty and acted as his own lawyer.
His defense was that he was framed by police.
But he had no explanation for the wash cloth and a wealth of evidence that contain the courtroom was packed pretty much every day.
Well they were waiting for the judge to come into the chambers Kirby Anthony turned and looked over at John Newman who is in the gallery there.
He said you're a full John.
I can remember our cameras capturing John's reaction he was crying in tears he was so angry.
Who say the stupidest thing the Kirby Anthony did was have themselves declared co counsel.
And try to represent himself.
And the other stupidest things actually get on the witness stand I'd say the other stupidest thing he did was he turned around to John Newman in court filled with people and called him a full.
After two hours of deliberation.
Kirby Anthony was found guilty and sentenced to three hundred fifty seven years in prison.
Detectives Mike Grimes has difficulty forgetting the unspeakable violence that took the lives of a loving mother and her two young children.
Scenario this and try and figure out why people do things you never can get inside their heads there was a sexual motivation there I had to reset region he was asked to move out I think something happened between him and when the little girl I think it's very reasonable with Kirby was a drug abuser.
The optically cocaine.
Knowing his psychopathic personality fueled by cocaine I think he went over there in a rage.
Nancy Newman's camera the one found in Kirby Anthony's possession after the merger is contained family photos taken during happier times.
Pictures of the lives destroyed.
By a senseless act of revenge.
