The date July twenty eighth nineteen ninety six.
The place sixty feet beneath the English Channel off the coast of Devon England.
A fisherman was about to hold a.
His catch of the day would be on a gruesome C..
Among the sea bass and crabs it was a very large cash a dead man with no apparent identification.
The nets had disturbed a watery grave revealing a mystery that would cross an ocean.
When John called back a fisherman of thirty years pulled a dead body on board he had a decision to make a floater is a bad omen I can do one of two things a I can pull this coastline because back in with a Saudi family gone fission or we take him in in which case with fish is gonna be condemned you're gonna lose a day's wages.
The victim was an unidentified male between the ages of forty and fifty from the amount of decomposition the path all the just determined that the body had been in the water for less than a week the victim was wearing a blue and white checkered shirt leather belt and green corduroy trousers with the pockets pulled inside out but the first exam of the body I noticed a tattoo on the back of the head I thought it was a cluster of stocks and that's what I said in my original report.
In any case I noted that I do like that not in British subjects there were several injuries noted on the body bruises on his left hip and lower leg and a four inch gash on the back of the head most likely the head injury caused unconsciousness but the actual cause of death was never in question the length of the best August to look for droning on the long showed evidence of droning.
So the cause of death was not difficult.
But why he got into the water and why he drone with the difficult part.
The only item of note on the victim was an expensive wrist watch it was a Swiss made Rolex brand oyster perpetual chronometer which it stopped on the twenty second of the month.
Every Rolex watch has a story.
Rolex keeps extraordinary records on their watches worldwide every Rolex watch comes with a serial number it's hidden on the watch.
But detailed records are capped for everyone who owns them watch for ever and all the servicing records.
The Rolex company identified the watch owner as Ronald J. Platt.
The victims next of kin were contacted his brother positively identified Ronald Platt's body by the tattoo on his hand the Canadian maple leaf Ronald Platt was a fifty year old television repairman who was divorced he hadn't been in regular contact with his family which is why he hadn't been reported missing.
Plant had been living in Essex County over three hundred miles from Devon where his body was discovered.
On his application for his last apartment rental he listed a man named David Davis as a reference I phoned David Davis so on his mobile phone number unfortunately I told him about the fact that we've recovered a body from the city which we believe to be his friend on a plan.
Davis told police that he and Ronald Platt had been friends but that he hadn't seen Platt in over three months.
David Davis was a fifty year old retired financial adviser from Canada who was living in England with this twenty one year old wife Noel and their two daughters.
Davis and his family lived in the small village of Woodham Walter in a cul de sac at the end of little London lane.
When police went to interview Davis in person they made the mistake of knocking on the wrong door the elderly gentleman replies no no no this isn't little one and farm that he says pointing next door that is little London farm.
So Redmond then asks well is that where David Davis lives.
And the elderly gentleman says no no no that's not where David Davis lives there's no David Davis there that's where Ronald Platt lives that's where Ronald Platt lives with his lovely wife and their two little children I couldn't believe what he was telling me you know it was bizarre.
The guy that I had thought was dead on a been identified as that to me was in fact alive and well and living in put a multi but why was David Davis now posing as Ronald plant there's clearly something wrong here and we have to put David Davis under the microscope find out who equals warm season this false identity was there something more sinister involved.
For reasons that were not at all clear David Davis a Canadian citizen living in England had been posing as Ronald Platt the name of the man found at the bottom of the English Channel.
An investigation into Davis's background revealed some troubling information.
For the last three years all of Davis's bills were paid for with checks and credit cards signed by Ronald Platt some signed after Platt's body was pulled from the sea Davis met the real Ronald plant through class girl friend Alain boys who work for David Davis and a small investment company Davis ran in London.
Police also discovered that David Davis owned a sailboat that was moored in Devon only a few miles from where Ronald Platt's body was discovered.
Police searched through David Davis's mobile telephone records which showed calls made from the same area where plants body was found and the calls were made during the same time period in July that the medical examiner said Ronald Platt drowned Davis claimed he hadn't seen his friend Ronald Platt in months but police found witnesses who saw them together in the Devon area shortly before plants death is clearly lying to us as well as using broadcasts identity and not change the complexion of things so I contacted Essex and told them to change the charge that they were going to arrest him for from check fraud to murder.
On Halloween morning in nineteen ninety six an armed English response team waited to arrest Davis at his home at the end of little London line.
A taxi unexpectedly drove down the lane in the middle of the police raid.
Davis made a dash from the house to the taxi which quickly took off to get past police finally the main police car catches up.
Pushes the taxi cab driver driver over to the shoulder.
A policeman with a very big gun drawn moves out of the car pointed directly through the window.
At Davis's head David Davis was arrested on suspicion of the murder of Ronald Platt in the house was Davis is twenty one year old wife no well and the couple's two little girls three year old Emily and Lillian who was just six months old.
Police allowed no L. to pack a diaper bag with items for the children one of the offices there was a little suspicious however but it's white and search the bargain inside find that she'd slipped inside the baby clothes four thousand pounds in cash and five gold bars.
Police headquarters no else purse contained a treasure trove of incriminating evidence documents in the name of Ronald Platt and plants girlfriend Elena boy.
And the children's birth certificates which listed Ronald Platt and Alain boys as the parents she gave no real explanation for that other than to say that when she got pregnant she needed medical attention actually used to laying voices identity cards to get that medical treatment the police are mystified by the gap in ages in fact it seems like about a thirty year gap she barely looks twenty he looks to be about fifty what's going on they decide that they're going to bear down on her and questioning see if they can make a cracking in fact they do when they find out something that surprises even them namely she blurts out he's my father.
No well refused to identify the father of the children.
David Davis's home on little London lane held a wealth of evidence envelopes stuffed with Swiss francs British pounds American dollars keys to storage lockers gold bars expensive paintings and in the mountains of documents a tiny scrap of paper that would be a turning point in the investigation.
And they found a receipt with seven items listed on it bought from a shop called sport Nautique in Dartmouth on the water in in those seven items there was something that was noted.
Was a ten pound plowing.
Police went back to the question John copay the fishermen pulled plants body out of the sea and his nets didn't notice the angle to we'll actually go physically got the gear on board to go to trial on board I didn't connect the two together until the following day.
The ten pounds zinc galvanized plow anchor found in the fishing nets with Ronald Platt's body.
May have been used to anchor plaque's body at the bottom of the English Channel and came loose when he was dragged to the surface by fishing nets.
When Dr Fernando laid the anchor next to the injuries on plaques lay.
It was becoming evident how Ron Platt died the anchor and plants belt was sent to the forensics lab for analysis.
On plants leather belt was a translucent deposit.
Police passed a forensic metallurgist to determine what made the mark I worked with a sample from the belts in the area of the mark on the sample from the surface of the anchor.
The mark on plants belt was analyzed with the scanning electron microscope and the material on the belt was identified.
Still unanswered was how Ron plants body got six miles out into the English Channel.
Dr Bob Allen.
Engineer analyze the location of the body and studied the water currents during the week plant was in the English Channel they told me where the body was recovered.
What they were concerned about was where the body entered the war.
We determine what the currents were in the area but what we weren't able to say was whether those currents were strong enough to move the body without some further work.
Dr Alan conducted a unique experiment to simulate a drowned man anchored to the bottom of the English Channel.
He attached a ten pound anchor to his belt expel the air from his lungs and sank to the bottom of an artificial channel which recreated the cold sea water and the same coverage that were present when plants body was dumped.
The anchor help the body firm meaning it was done in the same location where it was found.
Davis'S sailboat the lady Jane was brought into the forensics lab for an inspection.
Inside the cabin a small hair samples discovered on the seat cushion.
And there was a plastic sport no take bags from the same store where Davis purchased the anchor both were sent for forensic testing.
The fingerprints smooth non porous material like the sport no tea bag forensic experts put the bag in a sealed cabinet inside super glue is heated and the fumes adhere to the finger coils on the back which can be visualized when the bank is dipped in the yellow fluorescent dye which adheres to the finger oils the fingerprint on the sport no tea bag.
DNA testing of the hair found on the boat cushion revealed the hair was also that of Ronald Platt.
Police examine the ship's navigational device called a GPS Global Positioning System which record signals from three satellites tri angulation the boat's position on the earth.
A GPS stores the time and location of the boat when it is last turned off.
The GPS from Davis's bode indicated that he shot off the navigational device just three point eight nautical miles from the spot where the body resurfaced the date was July twentieth.
The Rolex watch found on Ronald Platt was self winding which means it runs for forty hours after it stops moving.
The watch stopped on July twenty second forty hours earlier made the date July twentieth the same date recorded by the GPS on the Lady Jane.
Police knew that David Davis wasn't this man's real name but just who was he.
A man living with his daughter as husband and wife with two small children whose paternity was unclear.
And what was his motive.
A retired businessman David Davis was a suspect in the murder of his friend Ronald Platt but investigators wanted to know his true identity.
When they compared Davis's fingerprints to those of wanted fugitives from around the world the prints matched a man who had been on the run for six years.
We had a hit David Davis came back again to five.
Albert J. Walker from Ontario Canada had been married for twenty two years and had four children he became one of the ten most wanted criminals in the world after embezzling over four million dollars from investors in Canada.
He was on the verge of being caught so we decided to flee Canada and he took his fifteen year old daughter Sheena with them.
And disappeared completely or almost Walker and his daughter Sheena live together in England as David and Noelle Davis man and wife one of the Canadian police decided phone Walker's wife.
And it was very simple very straightforward we found Albert and we found your daughter Sheena and by the way congratulations your grandmother.
When Walker fled to England he began working the same investment scams as he did in Canada and hired a lane boys as an executive assistant when Walker no longer needed Alain boys services he paid for a lane and her boyfriend Ronald Platt the move to Canada to start a new life together.
With plaque gone Walker assumed his identity.
But three years later Alain boys and Ronald Platt returned to England which threatened Walker's plans Matt and I were to run plants that was one too many for over Walker he had to get rid of his friend.
Alpert Walker put his plan into motion when he purchased a new ten pound anchor not for his sailboat but for Ronald Platt.
On July twentieth nineteen ninety six Walker invited plant out on the lady Jane for a day of sailing.
With a blunt instrument Walker not Platt unconscious with a blow to the back of his head.
On to the plastic bag.
Among the mistakes Walker made that day was failing to remove plants wrist watch with the serial number and using his boats Global Positioning System which captured the location date and time of the merger.
Albert Walker went on trial for murder.
In a rare courtroom occurrence Walker's daughter testified against her own father.
At a stage in the trial.
It came out in the courtroom.
That obviously Mister Walker and Sheena were father and daughter and yet two children were found on the premises when the police made their rate.
Well the jury was just struck down.
On July sixth nineteen ninety eight it took the jury just two hours to find Albert Walker guilty of first degree murder he was sentenced to life in prison.
He made one big mistake and that was so difficult to take off that Rolex watch and it was really that Rolex watch that led us to to the identity of rubble plot and started the whole chain of events which ended up with Walker getting a life sentence for murder.
Shino Walker is now living quietly with their children in Canada.
She would not agree to a paternity test on their two little girls I think Mr Walker is without a doubt probably the most fascinating character I've ever come across.
She was a consummate actor even as we speak this man is still plotting his way out of prison.
And I think that's I think it's chilling.
The injuries on his body showing us exactly how he was killed and have the anchor was used to weigh him down.
The piece of paper he wrote it for his reference re put David Davis and I was killer on a cell phone number which led us to Davis.
