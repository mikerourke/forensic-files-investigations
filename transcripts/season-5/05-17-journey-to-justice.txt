Just after dark on a warm summer evening five children were walking home along this road.
Suddenly out of nowhere.
Three of the children with him one was killed the driver sped away.
Investigators called on state of the art science to reconstruct the crime in hopes of learning how the accident happened and the identity of the driver.
Fort Lauderdale Florida is one of America's most popular resort town the beach in sunny weather bring in almost seven million tourists each year.
And the city is also home to one and a half million full time residents.
The Walker family settled into this working class neighborhood one they believed was safe from crime and violence.
The walkers youngest child six year old in the cold love the neighborhood because of the large number of children who all played together cheese didn't like to smile as she used to tell people I don't know how to smile you tickle or is a C. you can smile and always be a cockeyed smile glasses would always be cock I so used to calling my cookie cock eyed little one.
Just after dark on June twenty third nineteen ninety two.
Paul Walker was walking home with four other neighborhood children.
It was just after a rain storm and they were walking along the side of this road with there are no sidewalks.
When they got to the front of this apartment building there was a large puddle of water left from the rain storm.
Michelle and Gina the Tello for walking with Nicole that night they were ten years old at the time.
And there's a big puddles so we wanted to go through it so that we don't have to be in the street.
So Michelle picked her up and we started walking through the puddle as you're walking in this bottle I had to call my hands everybody was telling me to watch out.
And that was about all I remember and I see this car this big a bunch of lights.
By the time they saw the vehicle it was late the call Walker and Michelle the Tello we're both.
I went over to check on the Cole and I seen blood coming out of her mouth and our ears and I knew she was going to make it.
One of the kids ran to make calls home there was a knock at the door and it was Joel there was no color in his face and his eyes were so bugged out of his head he was just you could see the terror of the fright just saying the girls were all hit the girls were all hit.
The children were rushed to the hospital.
Michelle suffered a broken leg to broken wrist and a lacerated liver.
Nine year old brook man say suffered a fractured shoulder and facial injuries that required a dozen stitches six year old Nicole died shortly after arriving at the hospital.
Internal US surgeons came in and the conclusion was no she she doesn't have a chance and I begged and pleaded even for a one percent chance and they told me now there's no chance.
Nicole died of severe trauma to the head and massive internal injuries.
A witness said it was a man driving a green pickup truck with a white camper top which sped away quickly ran this red light and disappear.
I was just wondering why how can somebody like cysts hits people in this keep going without even.
Investigators were hoping that science could identify the pickup truck and the driver.
How could you hit five little kids and keep on going.
Suzanne Walker was grief stricken and angry over the death of her daughter Nicole I could you do that how could anybody hit kids and keep on going.
Just to know you lay them flat out in the middle of a road.
And but you had to know.
Detective Bruce Babcock a member of the league team of accident reconstruction as was called to the scene.
Just before the accident witnesses said a green truck swerved off the road knocking over some trash cans.
Then stopped in a nearby cul de sac.
A few minutes later the truck started up again heading back out of the neighborhood on the same road on southwest thirty Third Avenue.
As it approached the apartment building it veered off the road into the popular hitting three of the five.
Killing six year old Nicole Walker.
Witnesses said the truck picked up speed after fleeing the accident.
Bruce Babcock took detailed measurements of the accident scene and photographs when we got to the scene the real peace had been found.
In the puddle by a citizen who later gave it to one of the initially responding deputies there was also a piece of clothing that from the call that we found in the bottle itself.
The drill was unique it had come from a special edition nineteen eighty Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck.
Babcock also found pieces of plastic from the front turn signal lens of the truck.
Forensic chemist Bruce I outline the technicals clothing would contain vital evidence.
The first area of interest in my analysis was to examine the victim's clothing because many times and hit and run accidents where pedestrians involved there is paint transferred from the front end of the vehicle to the victim's clothing.
Under a microscope he discovered that the chips actually contained six different layers of paint but the outer layer of paint was blue and not green as the witnesses that indicated.
The grill left at the scene matched the pattern injury on the back of six year old Nicole Walker.
And the head injury on the back of her head indicated that Nichols had most likely hit the hood portion of the truck.
Investigators now change the description of the truck and notified the public to be on the lookout for a blue nineteen eighty Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck with possible front end damage and in essence there was a man hunt in an attempt to look for this vehicle because investigators knew that if they found this vehicle it was a great likelihood that they will be able to determine who is the driver of this truck and responsible for Nicole's death on this street news reports of a hit and run accident out rage the community.
Detectives searched all over Florida for the blue Silverado pick up truck.
Three weeks went by then an anonymous caller told police that a blue Silverado pickup truck was in a driveway about twenty miles from the accident scene.
As deputy arrived at the home got out of his vehicle and noticed as he was walking towards the front door that there was a truck.
Silverado pickup truck.
That was surrounded by other vehicles a washing machine had been placed in front of the truck obscuring its front end.
The truck did not have the white camper top witnesses described the front grille was intact although it was not the original one and the front turn signal lenses was broken.
In addition the tires did not match tiring pressures from the accident scene.
The truck was registered to Catherine Pierce whose husband fifty two year old can Pierce had a prior history of driving while under the influence of alcohol.
One of the victims thought the driver was a man but couldn't identify can Pierce as the driver of the vehicle the truck was just speeding at us all I can remember is a bright light.
Sprite lights coming straight at us.
I'M so confused.
Investigators face two difficult tasks first trying to prove that this was the truck involved in the accident and second to figure out who was driving the truck.
The problem for us which is developing the evidence that was going to be needed to show who in fact was the driver of this truck whose veer off that roadway and hit Nicole ray Walker that night endeared back on and didn't stop that was going to be a challenge.
It was now three weeks after the hit and run death of Nicole ray Walker and police had the truck they believe was involved in the accident but there were problems with making a definitive match if this was the truck in the accident it had been altered some time after the accident with different tires repairs to the front grille and the truck did not have the white camper top witnesses clearly recalled seeing.
There were no fingerprints inside the compartment of the truck which was extremely unusual.
The inside compartment had been wiped clean.
District attorney can patter which kept the picture of Nicole Walker on his desk a sign of his determination to find out what exactly happened on the night of the accident.
So he turned to a new state of the art scientific tool forensic animation which can create virtual rendering of an accident the best way to understand the concept of forensic animation or reconstruction would be to understand what we're trying to do is visualize the opinions of other experts all of the information gathered at the crash site by accident reconstruction this Bruce Babcock was taken into account the horizontal and vertical measurements of two thousand feet of roadway the eyewitness accounts the weather conditions and the injuries sustained by the victims.
The mechanical specifications of the nineteen eighty Chevrolet Silverado also programmed into the computer.
They also calculated the approximate tire pressure and the height and weight of their suspect can Pierce who is five foot eleven inches tall and two hundred ten pounds.
All would affect the height of the truck as it traveled down the street before striking the children.
The speed was uncertain so they estimated the truck was traveling thirty miles per hour the posted speed limit on that road.
Shell the teller was carrying six year old Nicole Walker on a right hip at the time of impact when the animators program this information they made a startling discovery.
The front grille Kenneth Pierce is trust would have struck Nicole Walker in the back at the exact same place and at the same twenty two degree angle reported by the forensic pathologist technicals autopsy we then took an angle of Nicole spine to the vertical the heights of the call from the roadway or the ground and suddenly it was at that point we discovered that we could match these bruising marks and contusions to actual elements on the front of the truck a real revelation to us and certainly something that could become very crucial in the case.
When the animation was complete it consisted of three different views and overhead perspective providing a bird's-eye view of what happened another from inside the vehicle which would have been the view of the alleged driver Kenneth Pierce from this vantage point you can see that the colts head would have hit the front of the truck causing her fatal head injury.
The third view a so called chase view was from behind the truck.
For further proof investigators turned to the paint chips found on the Cole shirt at the time of the accident.
The paint chip was blue but there were five other layers of paint underneath forensic chemist Bruce I allied ground the paint sample in a pestle then analyzed it using infrared spectroscopy which uses infrared light to identify the chemical makeup.
The results were charted onto a computer graph there were six different layers of paint there was blue metallic present blue non metallic gray body seller and it was a blue metallic factory paint a white factory primer and a black factory primer subsequently examined the suspect's vehicle we found that all six of those lawyers were present on his vehicle.
And finally the plastic particles found at the crime scene with the same color and materials as to broken turn signal on Pierce's truck.
Although there were no fingerprints found in the compartment of the truck Kenneth Pierce is partial thumb print was found on the hand on the floor of the vehicle.
Fifty two year old Kenneth Pierce was arrested and charged with vehicular homicide in the death of Nicole Walker.
The forensic animation showed clearly that the driver would have known he had hit the children at the time of the accident.
Before the trial can Pierce's neighbor Terry Jones came forward and told police that Pearce admitted driving the truck on the night of the accident Mr Jones told us that.
En Pierre said contacted him and requested data he come over and help.
X. the damage to the front of the vehicle he also.
received a camper top that have been taken off the vehicle the camper top was worth about five hundred dollars in Mr peers gave it to him for the work that he did on the car Kenneth Pierce had a number of prior arrests and convictions it should be someone significant if to find out that in addition to twenty arrests and convictions for felonies and misdemeanors and Mr Pierce's life he had two prior hit and run convictions.
At the trial prosecutors wanted to introduce the forensic animation to show the jury their version of what happened on the night of the accident defense lawyers claimed that the animation was nothing more than speculation and would prejudice the jury prosecutors said the animation was a factual account of the accident.
The judge ruled that the forensic animation was admissible.
Show that the blue Silverado truck traveling north on thirty third Avenue drove off the road and struck some trash.
After the vehicle stopped briefly in the cul de sac it then turned around and headed south on thirty Third Avenue.
As it approached the intersection of Griffin Avenue in front of the apartment building the truck veered off the road into the bottle and the chill.
The front grill of the truck struck a six year old Nicole Walker in the back at the twenty two degree angle leaving this deep bruise at the moment of impact.
I made a right turn on to Griffin Avenue and sped off.
The computer animation constructed exactly to scale shows that it was a truck the same height as the Chevrolet Silverado that was involved in the accident there was no reason for him not to have known that it was in fact children that he struck in fact witnesses said that he accelerated from the scene as a flat every single one of those jurors had their eyes glued to that television screen and I can say as I studied them and watch them view that computer animation that I had every single moment.
Of their attention captured for that brief period of time.
The moment of impact paint chips were also deposited on the cold clothing paint chips which were later in the match to Mr Pierce's truck.
About front end damage to nineteen eighty Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck he hired Terry Jones hi Terry Jones to fix the front of the truck in addition to the scientific evidence jurors heard testimony that can Pierce made efforts to conceal damage to the truck after the accident and confided to one person that he was driving the truck.
Just weeks after what would have been Nicole Walker seventh birthday jurors delivered a verdict.
The defendant is guilty of vehicular homicide please please have an accident with death and charged in the information so they we all because of Mr Pearce's prior convictions he was sentenced to forty years in prison I'm very glad about that this man had seven prior is in the state of Florida.
He never once ever admitted to what he did.
He'S got so many prior respect to nineteen fifty two.
And I'm sorry I don't want this man in our society.
This case was the first time forensic animation had been admitted into evidence in a Florida court and only the third time in the United States.
Trial lawyers whether they be criminal prosecutors or defense attorneys or several lawyers now have an opportunity to use a dynamic new form of evidence to educate jurors about issues that are before them in courts all over this country.
For the victims Kenneth Pierce's behavior that night still raises questions for which there are few answers.
Why didn't you stop why didn't you stop.
Why did you just hit kids plow into them living there to die in a puddle and just keep on going.
Just you know is that that's the biggest thing why why not just stop.
Well this case involves the death of a little girl and I became determined to ensure that justice was done for her.
And Nicole ray Walker's family.
Blew up at a photograph of their daughter and had a tear painted on her cheek.
And they presented detective Babcock and myself with a copy of this picture and I have that picture in my office and it sits there and I knew it every day because that photograph reminds me.
That justice can still be had in the criminal justice system.
And the day that I don't feel that way anymore is the day that I'm going to take down her picture.
