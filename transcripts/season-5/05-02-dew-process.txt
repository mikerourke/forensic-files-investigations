In August of nineteen eighty six but he will suffer a thirty two year old housewife and mother was strangled and murdered by an assailant who had broken into her home her husband Dr Glenn will suffer was also strangled and knocked unconscious but survived the attack.
His younger brother Neil lived right across the street and was the first to arrive at the scene.
A few months later Neil will suffer was dead to.
Some say because of what he learned about the intruder.
Glenn and Betty will server had been married for nine years.
It was a romance that had begun twenty years earlier.
The family both on Betty site and Glenside came from a very well established influential families within the community very well liked by all of the community.
Betty and Glenn were childhood sweethearts they went to high school together Glenn will suffer went on to dental school later married Betty and after graduation the couple returned to their home town of Wilkes Barre Pennsylvania to set up practice.
The world suffers bought a home on First Street just a few houses away from the glands younger brother Neil.
Two brothers were unusually close they were almost like twins it's a very rarely did things apart they were really big into sports and they and they they just grew up together like that and they live near each other and they were inseparable he and his brother and when Glenn and Betty gave birth to a daughter Danielle their life together seemed perfect but tragedy struck on Saturday morning August thirtieth nineteen eighty six just after dawn plan will support called his younger brother Neil telling him that an intruder had broken into his home.
Neil ran across the street to glance home and when he saw the plane had been assaulted Neil phoned police.
When police arrived plan will suffer was downstairs on the floor fading in and out of consciousness.
Up steers had been ransacked furniture was overturned desk drawers emptied one of the officers and went up stairs father's daughter was still sleeping in her bedroom five year old and then went into the.
The world's first bedroom and found Betty laying on the floor she was dedicated to.
Betty Wilson for his body was on the floor next to the bed there were abrasions around her neck and her face showed signs of a severe beating.
It'S obvious that there was a homicide because of the marks around her neck and then in the.
Because he was a vicious attack upon this woman.
My father had told me that that body was murdered and they were the specific words.
How or what had happened I didn't know but that just took me totally by surprise of course.
And so many things go through your head you just you can't even sort them out.
It appears that the intruder climbed a ladder to the roof over the back porch and entered through a second story window the window screen had been removed and placed on the roof.
When will suffer told police that he was asleep when he heard a loud noise in the back of his house around six AM he said he grabbed his gun and saw a masked intruder running down the stairs and the public.
You'Re surprised him from behind strangled him with a belt and knocked him unconscious with a blow to his head.
Some time later when plan regained consciousness he phoned his brother.
Things like that just didn't happen in Wilkes Barre.
Very nice woman getting killed in her own home did not make sense to a lot of people.
And will suffer told police that thirteen hundred dollars in cash was missing from his desk in the study and some gold and diamond jewellery and a house key were also missing.
But police noticed something suspicious the phone in the kitchen was hanging off the hook.
Police wondered if the victim's brother Neil had simply forgotten to hang up the phone after calling police or whether it was evidence of crime scene staging.
The news of Betty Wilson for his murder and the assault on her husband gland stunned the small industrial community of Wilkes Barre Pennsylvania.
Dr Glenn will suffer was a successful dentist in town his wife an active volunteer for many local charities neither had any known and.
They were very popular couple everybody knew them mom they were the pretty couple Betty was very popular he was kind of quiet type but still he was a jock good looking and so for those reasons everybody knew both of them were.
At least acknowledge that there had been a number of recent burglaries in the world suffers neighborhood.
Since thirteen hundred dollars in cash and some jewellery was missing from the world suffers home robbery was a possible motive.
It appeared that the intruder used a ladder the world suffers stored on the side of their house to gain entrance through an open second story window.
A partial palm print was discovered on the inside of the window sill which did not match anyone in the family or the police.
The autopsy on the body will suffer was performed by Lucerne county coroner Dr George who died who found no evidence of sexual assault.
The cause of death was strangulation which would take from three to five minutes during that time it was obvious to doctor who doctor there had been fears life and death struggle and I believe that she really fight back with fury and that she inflicted.
Some injuries on whoever is sailor blue fibers and a small speck of blood found under Betty's fingernails confirmed she had been in close contact with her killer.
But doctor who doctor noticed something unusual.
Despite a severe beating there was no blood on that he will suffer tonight down.
And very little blood on her that was the outstanding thing that imprinted itself on my brain when we saw the body.
You didn't have to be a trained forensic pathologist to recognize that there was something suspicious there all of the injuries to the mouth in the neck and no blood on the face and no blood on the clothing.
It appears that after killing that he will suffer the killer had washed her face and changed her nightgown.
Police search for her bloody clothing in the house the surrounding neighborhood and the nearby Susquehanna River without success since the body was lying in front of the fans time of death was difficult to gauge doctor who doc estimated that Betty will suffer had been murdered between two thirty and four thirty in the morning.
Two to four hours before land said he heard the intruder and there was another inconsistency.
Doctors at mercy hospital noticed injuries on the back up plan will suffers neck even though he said he was strangled from behind.
It doesn't make any sense they just could not happen that way the only way you could get that entry to the back of your neck uses somebody pulled from the front.
Friends told investigators that gland often wore a gold chain around his neck if he was involved with a fight with his wife or his wife would have been saying the bed underneath him and he was on top of her in that position he would sustain those type of injuries from that piece of jewelry.
That type of force would damage the spleen is capita's muscles too long muscles which support the head the same injury emergency room doctors diagnosed in gland will suffer after his wife's murder.
When investigators dug a little deeper into gland will serve for his dental practice they discovered his relationship with his dental assistant was more personal than business the two had been carrying on an affair for five years she told investigators that she expected plan to leave his wife for her but she realized that wouldn't happen when she discovered that gland was carrying on another affair with an aerobics instructor in town.
From motel receipts police learned that land would sometimes have trysts with both women on the same day before going home to his wife there was a a man who not only.
Have an affair he cheated on his wife but here was a man who had an affair cheated on his girlfriend at the same time and police wanted to know why Glenn's younger brother Neil sale to go upstairs to check on his brother's wife and child while he waited for the police to arrive.
While on his way to the district attorney's office to answer that very question Neil made a decision that would change the course of the investigation.
When homicide investigators learned that Betty Wilson for his body had been washed enter clothes changed after the merger they looked a little closer at the statements gland and his younger brother Neil both gave to police.
On the night of the murder.
When will suffer said he was out with friends at a local nightclub and drove home around two thirty.
He said that he went right to bed and slept until dawn when he heard the intruder and went downstairs to investigate.
But the police video taken on the morning of the murder shows that Glenn Wilson first car in the driveway was not covered with dew yet his wife's car while.
To help sort out the discrepancy police called in a forensic meteorologist Dr Joseph Sobel who studied the weather patterns on the night of the murder do is moisture it's condensation that actually forms on the object we're talking about whether it be a blade of grass or rooftop or car top or any object that happens to be outside during that time.
The temperature on the afternoon of the merger was seventy degrees so the dew point temperature the point when water in the air becomes cold enough to change from a gas to a liquid producing do would have occurred when the temperature reaches fifty degrees we know that I was clear surface weather observations showed us that we know it was very cool so that the temperature was able to drop considerably and we know that there was little or no wind.
The temperature hits fifty degrees at eleven PM Glenn will suffer said he drove home at two thirty in the morning yet there was no do on his car when police arrived at seven AM.
If he had driven home at two thirty in the morning Glenn's car would have had the same amount of do as his wife's car.
The lack of doom and someone had driven plan was the first car some time after Glenn returned home from the light two thirty and before police arrived at seven AM evaporating the dude that had been present and the same due points produced due on the world suffers roof yet there were no foot or hand prints in the deal on the roof when police arrived.
When police look more closely at the latter they discovered it had been placed up to the roof back with the steps facing in the opposite direction.
The partial palm print found on the window sill could not be identified potentially corroborating bland story about an intruder.
Police were also investigating what connection if any glands younger brother Neil may have had to the merger he was the first one to arrive at the scene and was the one that called the police.
But when police arrived the phone was off the hook hanging from the wall unit.
Police were also suspicious of Neil's behavior it made it that he did not go upstairs to check on Glenn's wife and five year old daughter Danielle before police arrived.
Neil Boyle suffered denied any involvement in the crime but when asked to take a lie detector test you refuse a lot of people think that Neil knew everything that when he came in the house that Glenn told him what happened he said you have to help me we have to concoct a story if there's people that even think the deal may have been the one they knock Colin on the head then there's the other school that think that meal suspected.
And he just kept putting two and two together and things that.
Glenn may have said to him and just just the very thought was too much for me to bear.
Neil was asked to report to the district attorney's office for an interview.
One past the time when he was supposed to arrive.
And Gary sworn left the room he came back in and he says.
The incident occurred so we went up and took a look at the scene.
And it was gruesome past the courthouse he drove about another five miles and that his car swerved in front of the dump truck was killed instantly.
Investigators could find no skid marks it appeared that Neil will suffer intentionally turned in front of an oncoming truck.
Our inner ruled the death a suicide.
It made me feel sad the fact that somebody was involved.
With the crime and because of guilt.
Some innocent person had to die and when you have the death of a person there's always so many other people it.
Suffer we know that joy can be shared with others but how grief can only be indoors along.
And what Neil Wilson for a may have known about the merger went with him to his grave.
With Dr Glenn will suffer as the prime suspect in his wife's murder police discovered that the all American image he presented to the public was just that an image before her death that he will suffer told friends that she knew all about her husband's affairs with the aerobics instructor and his dental assistant and that she had had enough we found out from some of Betty's girlfriend said she was very annoyed with some of these things that were happening very annoyed with him going out at nights and not coming in until all hours of the morning and some of the girlfriends even made comments to her well maybe you should confront him maybe should ask him what's going on to see if there was any evidence of a physical confrontation between clan and his wife FBI analyst Doug Dietrich analyze the debris under Betty Wilson first fingernail.
There he found a number of blue cotton denim fibers using micro spectro photometry Dietrich analyzes a spectrum of color in the diet those fibers and concluded that the die was consistent with the dye used in the denim shirt and jeans that plan will suffer was seen wearing at the nightclub just hours before his wife's murder.
Finally do you drink analyze several head hairs on the bed spread next to Betty Wilson first body the hairs had been forcibly removed and were compared to hear samples from the planet will suffer from the laboratory standpoint the hairs that were forcibly removed on the betting were consistent with the husband I looked at other hairs that were recovered from the bedding and from the towers and there were no hairs out of place I mean the hairs that I found were consistent with people that lived in that house.
On November fifth nineteen ninety plan will suffer was charged with first degree murder.
He did not guilty.
Prosecutors stated that on the afternoon before the merger plan met his dental assistant for a sexual encounter.
A few hours later plans saw his other mistress at a local nightclub he may have been hoping to have sex with her too but her husband was there.
Brian drove home around two thirty in the morning.
And that he may have confronted glance over his sexual liaisons.
The argument turned five.
As she fought for her life.
And washed her body in what was probably a psychological attempt to mask his guilt over what had occurred.
Prosecutors believe that plan used his card to dispose of the bloody clothing which evaporated the deal.
When he returned he staged the crime scene by placing the ladder up to the back of his house but he made a mistake and propped it up backwards he also remove the window screen and ransacked some of the rooms.
The telephone receiver found off the hook was either a mistake made during the staging of the crime scene or Neil will suffer simply forgot to hang up the telephone after calling police.
The jury had to choose between clan will suffers intruder story and the circumstantial case put forward by prosecutors and amid the discrepancies in the plan will suffer story one fact stood out after an alleged a life and death struggle with an intruder neither plan or his brother Neil ever went upstairs to check on that he will suffer or five year old Danielle before the police arrive.
Glenn will suffer was found guilty of third degree murder and was sentenced to eight to twenty years in prison for the death of my sister it's the hurt on behalf of both families.
Very close friends and friends and people in the community in general.
That this one person is hurt.
That'S devastating that's.
Here'S a guy who just cared about himself the only person that he ever cared about was himself Glenn was worried about the land and no one else and I think that was shown by the verdict in this case.
Benjamin Franklin once said three may keep a secret if two of them are dead.
That might have been true in this case had it not been for the role of science.
When I go out to talk to people about forensic meteorology I always talk about this case and I go through the whole scenario in the set up and.
And then I asked people okay so where's the weather connection you know where it is whether become involved and usually all I get is a set of blank stares so to think about that and to tie it in and then to go get expert corroboration I think was really a very very good piece of police and detective work.
