In nineteen eighty two an eleven year old girl was abducted in broad daylight from the softball field in Marshall bill Ohio.
When her badly decomposed body was found one week later.
Investigators hope that the R. ange trying angular shaped fibers found at the scene would lead them to the king.
Marshal bill Ohio is a small agricultural community with a population of just under seven hundred fifty.
It'S the kind of place where everybody knows everybody else.
All care about each other.
Christa Leigh Harrison was a care free eleven year old girl growing up in a place most residents thought was exempt from big city crime Chris Harrison was always around the town when we were at the ballpark playing softball her brother and I on the on the local softball team Chris was always near the home plate area there when we were coming in off the field always joke around with this.
On July seventeenth nineteen eighty two Christa and the friend the boy who lived nearby for collecting aluminum cans at the softball field which was directly across the street from Christus home when the boy went to get a drink a van drove up and stopped next to Krista.
The boy told authorities the man forced Krista into his van and took off.
I'Ve been on the force for ten years at the time this happened and I had never seen anything like this we never.
I can't even tell you the last time we experienced anything a production like this young child so it was.
For all of us.
Within hours police set up roadblocks and issued an all points bulletin for the van which was described as a dark red or brown with bubble shaped rear side windows Christa's friend described the doctor as a white male aged twenty five to thirty five with dark curly hair and a moustache.
Volunteers search the entire area immediately following the abduction on the ground.
In the area and also in the local waterways all without success.
We were anticipating maybe a ransom telephone call to the parents so we had made arrangements to record phone calls we have set up separate phone lines for them to use or they wouldn't have to tie up their telephone hopefully we waiting to get this ransom call which never came.
Six days later in a deserted field just outside of town hunters found the badly decomposed remains of a young girl.
The body was partially wrapped in a clear plastic bag near the body investigators found a pair of men's blue jeans a plaid shirt and a pair of black leather gloves a few miles away searchers found a clump of human hair a beach towel and the cardboard box covered with blood.
Forensic tests confirmed that the body was that of Christa Harris.
Mr Harrison Jr was there a little after I arrived and we told jailed you know after I so I could not identify right.
She was just so decompose and they and I told you all this is just you know remember Chris the way she was the autopsy revealed Krista had died of strangulation.
He had also been sexually assaulted in Christa's hair clothing and on the beach towel found near the body forensic scientists noticed some unusual our range fibers I saw the fibers of several fibers that really stood out they were an ugly orange fiber forensic scientist Jeffrey Lynn had seen the same orange fibers before just eight months earlier similar fibers were found on the body of twelve year old Tina Harmon who had been raped and murdered in a nearby town it was amazing to me that I saw the same fibers on Christopherson the nine C. nineteen Armand's Tina Harmon's were so unusual there were so many of them we really thought they were important I really thought those were important at that time but when I saw my Cristero some then I knew we had something very important there was a problem the man convicted of Harmon's murder common ray rocker was in police custody at the time of Krista Harrison's murder Rucker was serving a life sentence for that crime.
The evidence against Rucker had been largely circumstantial since investigators had not been able to link rocker to the distinctive orange fibers and investigators now wondered whether the wrong man had been convicted of Tino Harmon's murder if so a serial murderer was on the loose in the farmlands of Ohio.
When Krista Harrison's body was discovered in the field thirty miles from our home in Marshall bill Ohio investigators had only two clues to the perpetrators identity first the witness said the doctor was driving up brown van with bubble shape side rear windows second there were a number of unusual orange fibers and Krista Harrison's here and on the beach towel found near her body.
In the forensics lab scientists discovered that the fibers were man made specifically polyester under the microscope the fibers were tri angular in shape or try locals the fact that it was polyester in trilobal indicated to me even back before we had a suspect that it was likely a carpet fiber forensic scientist Jeffrey Lynn was concerned since he found the same are inch fibers on another victim twelve year old Tina Harmon who was raped and murdered eight months earlier the migrant farmworker common rail rocker had already been convicted of Tina Harmon's merger and was serving a life sentence in prison they were too unusual to be seen on the bodies of two girls both of ducted both sexually assaulted both murdered in Wayne County investigators realized that the possibility of Krista Harrison and Tina Harmon both coming into contact with orange trilobal carpet fibers at the hands of two different killers was extremely unlikely some quick tests between the two fibers.
Show the day compared and that they were the same.
Now people were very nervous because we had in in in the minds of the community two girls taken from our village streets and it appeared to be the same person investigators turned their attention to the clear plastic bags found wrapped around Krista Harrison's ankles it was unusual because of its thickness and the unique way the bag had been folded in the manufacturing process FBI special agent bill Callas needed to find the all region of that plastic bag he traced it to a manufacturer in pioneer Ohio the bank found with Krista Harrison was the same thickness size and shape and had the same old patterns as those manufactured for a line of black leather custom C. for use in vans the seats were sold exclusively through a specialty mail order catalog for Sears Roebuck and company.
Cardboard box used to transport Krista Harrison's body was unusual since it was L. shaped and was positively identified as the shipping container for the same black leather band seats the next step was to search Sears records to identify all Ohio residents who had purchased these black leather seats in the months preceding Chris does adoption the next order of business was of course to go to those people and interview them to determine whether or not they might be a potential suspect in our case.
There were only twenty three people in northern Ohio who ordered these leather band seats but non owned a red maroon or brown van with tear drop shaped bubble windows on the back side panel that were clearly described by the witness the killer with the orange carpet was still on the loose this guy is obviously out there we haven't got him yet he's done this before and he's certainly likely to do it again so there there was a real urgency to finding this individual.
The town of Marshall bill Ohio mourned the death of Christopher Lee Harrison and life went on.
Although no one felt the same sense of security they once did.
Weeks passed then months.
Then the one year anniversary of Christa's murder still with no arrest to the disappointment of investigators working the case it appeared.
Trail of the bright orange fibers had turned cold.
People became very aware of the safety of their children they lock the doors at night the kids or not of I side of a trusted.
Neighbor their parents at cetera.
You know people that watch their kids a lot closer the park became a ghost town children didn't play out there for a while and tremendous apprehension that this could happen again.
Investigators wondered whether Krista Harrison's killer would strike again and if so.
Krista Harrison's killer left behind a trail of physical evidence investigators knew he ordered black leather band seats from the Sears mail order catalog because the plastic covering and carton from that purchase were found with Chris to Harrison's body they also knew that the killer had our inch trilobal shape carpet in his van or home all they needed now was a suspect the fibers were something that were left behind by the criminal but we didn't have the second part of the equation we needed to match those fibers with fibers in the possession of a suspect or criminal it took police an entire year before they finally got the break they needed and they got it from a most unlikely source fifty miles from where Krista Harrison was abducted the manager of a local gas station a woman we'll call Debbie was doing some maintenance work outside when she was abducted at gunpoint.
She was driven to an unknown location and over the next several hours ahead we shave.
She was being assaulted and tortured with electricity.
And no one should be out on the street after they have done.
What they did to me and I was twenty eight at the time the man tortured her by taking a lamp cord cutting the wire and plugging it in and then using the two electric leads I was tortured.
It was the blood that was everywhere it was on the ceiling.
Try to escape.
After twelve hours of captivity still bleeding from her wounds Debbie said Norma so will to survive took over.
I even thought at one point I have to eat my farms if I couldn't I mean I was so desperate to to get out because I knew he was going to kill me.
Eventually Debbie freed one of her hands from the ropes and then was able to free her ankles.
This left the excruciatingly painful process of attempting to pull her remaining hand through the metal frame of the hand caught.
She grabbed the bathrobe and flat.
Once outside that he had no idea where she was so she turned to the only place he could think of for help I looked up to god they said god I need to sign I need help I don't know where I'm at and a poodle heart so I went to the house and she was a wonderful wonderful lady Mrs Smith Mrs Smith immediately phoned the police she was so badly bruised that look like deep purple underwear that she was wearing.
It was god's world.
I'M a miracle.
As far as escaping it was a miracle Debbie identified the man who had kidnapped her as Robert Anthony Buell's you'll work for the city of Akron Ohio in the planning department was college educated dating a local attorney and was a respected member of the community.
Faced with the evidence against him Buell pleaded no contest to the charge of kidnapping and rape but police couldn't help but notice the deal was driving a brown van similar to the one seeing that Krista Harrison's abduction although it did not have the same bubble shaped windows in the back the witness clearly described bills fan did have an orange carpet in the back Robert Beal denied he was involved in Krista Harrison's induction deals attorney pointed out that even if the carpet in the back of the old van was similar to the carpet fibers found on Krista Harrison they were not unique since many other Ohio residents had similar carpet in their home office or automobiles and even though this polyester trilobal ugly orange color was pretty unique certainly there are millions of other fibers like it in the world this is not like a fingerprint comparison this is not like a DNA comparison this is not a definitive match what else would prosecutors find out about these unusual orange fibers would there be another link to someone the case.
A year after the murder of eleven year old Krista Harrison.
He'S finally had a suspect in forty three year old Robert Buell an employee of the city of Akron Ohio.
He had been arrested for the kidnapping and rape of a gas station manager who escaped after twelve grueling hours of torture.
And in a surprise discovery in the back of the old van investigators found orange polyester trilobal carpet similar to the fibers found.
On Christopher Hitchens body we now had the second part of the equation we had the fibers from Christa's hair we had the fibers from Christus clothing we had the fibers from the Budweiser blanket we now have something to compare it to the fibers from the band to see how rare or common this carpet was investigators tracked the manufacturer of the carpet to the JP Stevens company in canton Ohio factory records indicated that this particular cop it was not a big seller because of its color they had only ever manufactured twelve thousand square yards of this carpeting.
Their records also showed that out of that twelve thousand square yards only seventy four square yards was ever shipped to northern Ohio further investigation revealed that Robert Buell had purchased two black leather band seats from Sears and Roebuck on June thirtieth just three weeks before Christmas murder the plastic bags which covered those seats along with the cardboard shipping box were both found with Chris to Harrison's body.
Robert Buell also owned a van similar to the one had Chris to Harrison's abduction it was similar but not identical since you'll stand did not have the tear drop shaped bubble windows the witness described however neighbors told police that Buell had removed the bubble shape side windows and installed sliding rectangular ones shortly after Chris to Harrison's murder inside Robert deals home was even more evidence linking him to Krista Harrison's murder.
Police discovered Robert Buell owned a pair of jeans identical in size make and with the same where patterns as the discarded jeans found near Krista Harrison's body tiny specks of beige and blue paint also found on the discarded jeans matched the beige and blue paint samples on the walls of property deals on.
Black spray paint from deals garage was found on the cardboard box found near Christus body.
Prosecutors believe that Buell took Krista Harrison to his home immediately following the abduction the R. inch carpet fibers from the band were later found in Krista Harrison's here.
After the merger you'll place Christa's body in the plastic bag from one of these new fans seats then placed the body inside the cardboard shipping box that held those seats.
You'Ll dump the body thirty miles outside of town in the field.
A little further away Buell discarded the jeans and shirt he had been wearing.
Tests on the bones indicated the body had been in extremely high temperatures for quite some time an indication the body was in the vehicle for days before it was dumped in the field.
Robert you'll never realized that the unusual orange carpet fibers from his van along with the ability to track the plastic bag in the cardboard box.
Would be his undoing on April fourth nineteen eighty four a jury found Robert Anthony Buell guilty of the kidnapping sexual assault and murder of eleven year old Christa Leigh Harrison and sentenced him to death in the electric chair.
Herman ray rocker the man convicted of Tina Harmon's merger won a new trial since the same our inch trilobal carpet fibers were discovered at that crime scene.
Rucker was later acquitted.
Prosecutors believe that Robert fuel may have been involved in Tina Harmon's murder Robert deal denies this and no charges have been filed.
Investigators agree that if it hadn't been for Debbie's courage perseverance and will to survive Robert deal might never have been apprehended I have to believe that Krista's watching.
Watching us all of us.
And maybe she was the angel that helped me you know.
And I'm sure.
She said that you know.
He can't hurt another person your child.
I knew that when I first saw the fibers on the victim they had a potential to be very important and they turned out to be a very definitive link between this individual and Krista here since this case was built on scientific evidence and the fiber evidence was a scientific evidence that allowed the jury to find people guilty of killing Christa Harrison and impose the death penalty for that crime.
