All homes have a history which includes the memories hopes and dreams of all who had lived there.
But this home in a quiet upscale neighborhood in suburban New York held something more in a steel drum stored in a crawl space was a secret that someone had hoped would last a lifetime.
September second nineteen ninety nine was moving day for the Cullen family in Jericho New York.
Before leaving that day Ronald Koeman noticed that the sanitation workers hadn't picked up all this trash a note on the large steel drum said it wasn't removed because of its weight.
No one had no idea what was inside since it had been full space in his home since the day he moved in nine years earlier.
Colin was overcome by a terrible stench inside.
He saw what appeared to be a human hand and the lady shoes.
Local police transported the drum to the Nassau County morgue where all of its contents were carefully removed for forensic examination inside with the mummified remains of a young woman.
There were also some plastic pellets a green plastic flower stem with leaves and a woman's pocketbook which was submerged in a mysterious brownish green liquid at the bottom of the draw the liquid had virtually destroyed the contents of the pocketbook which might have identified the victim.
The cause of death appeared to be blunt force trauma to the head was most noteworthy to the body and the cause of death was that there were ten different injuries called lacerations to the back and upper part of her head there are multiple fractures to the skull in some areas the skull was broken into small pieces there also was blood staining to these areas of injuries indicating that they occurred while she was alive but who was this merger woman the medical examiner determined that the woman was either white or Hispanic between twenty and thirty years of age she stood approximately five feet tall she also had some unusual dental work but didn't appear to be dental work that was performed in the United States have led me to believe it was from the south American country.
When Dr Catanese X. rayed the body he made a shocking discovery.
A seventeen inch fetus a close to full term baby boy.
Three pieces of jewelry were removed from the body two rings and a locket that was inscribed to the trees love uncle Phil.
The first discovery would come from the barrel itself.
It was several coded numbers on the drum one was as good as a fingerprint it led to a chemical company in Linden New Jersey company records indicated that the drum was manufactured in nineteen sixty five now thirty four years later it shows up as someone's makeshift coffin.
A fifty five gallon steel drums concealed in the crawl space of a suburban New York home revealed shocking evidence of a homicide.
The most recent owner said it had been in the crawl space since the day he moved in in nineteen ninety the owner before that told police the same thing and said it never occurred to him to open the container since they were chemical labels on the side the woman's purse found in the liquid at the bottom of the drawn contains some papers and an address book the pages were illegible since the liquid had reduced the paper to little more than Paul.
They were all sent to a forensic document examiner for analysis it was so heavily and sickly encrusted with a brownish yellow slime.
It was like a jelly like substance and coated everything and when I touched the evidence with my gloves on I could see the stitches came right off of my hands.
The items had to be placed in a forensic drying cabinet for several days to draw out the moisture.
When dry they could be examined with the video spectral comparator or V. S. C. which combines advanced digital engineering with the full range of infrared light sources in order to visualize writing that is not discernible with the naked eye this technology can show where alterations have been made on the check with the various light sources under an infrared luminescent setting the different banks will blow magnification can also detect when official documents had been altered.
Two pages of a legal contract appear the same but under ultraviolet light it reveals that one of the pages was added later.
Indented impressions left behind become visible with bleak or sidelight.
Light from behind or transmitted light can show what's written under correction fluid.
After the pages from the barrel were dry the results were disappointing the liquid had remove the ink from the pages.
But after hours of meticulous and delicate work under infrared camera filters the document examiner started to see some names and addresses in the address book AS eight put it under the machine and try the various filters and lights some names and phone numbers and addresses started to come up in the book it was actually quite amazing to see writing appear from within the pages of this book that had been submerged in these fluids for thirty some odd years but the information in the address book was thirty years old two and when investigators dial the telephone number is the individuals had long since moved.
Facing the parents dead and investigators turned their attention to the family who owned the home in the nineteen sixties.
Time frame in which the steel drum had been manufactured.
The owner in those years was a man named Howard Elkins who is now retired and living in Boca Raton Florida and we have people in the neighborhood who are long term residents say a was involved in some plastics company in Manhattan.
The plastic connection rang alarm bells since the plastic leaf and plastic pellets were found in the drama along with the murdered woman.
In the nineteen sixties Howard Elkins was part owner of the Melrose plastic company in Manhattan.
The company manufactured plastic plants and trees.
As investigators made plans to interview Howard Elkins in Florida the address book from the drama started to reveal more names and more secrets.
The pieces of the puzzle were starting to come together in the search for the identity of the murdered pregnant woman found in the medical drama.
The serial numbers on the drum led investigators to a chemical company based in New Jersey I went there with the detective from our lab who has some knowledge of chemicals.
We went there we show them the pallets then we show them the green material.
Show the pictures of the bio the chemical company identified the green liquid in the bottom of the drama as a dye halogen green dye used to color the bases on plastic flowers and trees but it hadn't been manufactured since nineteen seventy one the palace in the drama with the type used in making plastic leaves and flowers like the plastic leaf found with the body.
The local newspaper coverage of the unidentified woman in the steel drum led to an anonymous telephone call to the Nassau County police it tells us about the drum where it comes from tells us that that that was the chemicals that they use when they were mixing the basis for the use of artificial trees so he puts all this together it puts everything in perspective for us the caller did not know the identity of the dead woman but said that Howard Elkins was having an affair in the nineteen sixties with an Hispanic woman who worked for him in his plastic factory so we now have things to talk about other than the fact that there was a barrel found under his house.
When police flew to Boca Raton Florida to speak with Howard Elkins he wasn't entirely cooperative.
Did you ever use this type of the barrel in your business now we never had any doubt.
Never use the chemical we had known they were plastic pellets found in the barrels and we believe that they would use in your business is that right.
I don't know what they would be.
He lied to us we knew he was lying to us within five minutes of the interview I estimate one point if it.
Do you have did you ever have a family.
Any kind of surprises me said yes but then we went into what was her name I don't know.
Can you describe it was thirty years ago should you can't even describe what she told me she short she fad wishy skinny which is Spanish I don't remember.
After about twenty minutes of this I had removed the.
From my briefcase a kid and I asked him if he would give me permission for me to take a swab from the inside of his mouth.
for DNA purposes.
To see if in fact was the father of that baby he told us now he said he didn't think you would allow that.
The interview was interrupted by a phone call from Elkins wife Elkins asked the police to leave saying he wanted to speak with her privately this is prime you're gonna have.
I said that there's not a doubt in my mind that he was involved in.
As police left to get a court order Howard Elkins left to go shopping.
And some ammunition.
Howard Elkins was found inside a neighbor's garage by police and his own son.
A shot gun between his legs fatal self inflicted wound to his head the seventy year old retired plastics executive left no final note of explanation.
After his suicide investigators took a sample of Howard Elkins block and sent it to the lab Corp a North Carolina D. N. A. testing facility planned for testing for paternity we look for shared DNA bands between the child or the fetus and the alleged father in the case of the fetus found in the drum there were obstacles to overcome.
The tissue samples from the fetus were very badly degraded after thirty years.
Technique called polymerase chain reaction or PCR allowed scientists to amplify the existing DNA making an analysis possible.
The cells the DNA banding pattern from the fetus this is the DNA banding pattern from Mr Elkins at every region of the DNA that we tested the fetus and Mr Elkins have abandoned common Mr options could not be excluded with a ninety nine point nine three percent probability of paternity.
One mystery remained the identity of the woman in the.
The small address book that had been submerged in the green liquid in the bottom of the drum was finally starting to tell the story.
Thirty year old secrets on blank pages that were now readable with the latest in forensic technology I.
Kept looking through the book and on this page on the second line I found the name Mr Elkins.
In the address in Manhattan with a phone number.
On another page.
Lee readable with the words residency Anambra.
A resident alien number.
And the address and telephone number of someone named Kathy and dry day investigators were surprised to learn that after thirty years she was still living in the same apartment with the same telephone number.
Kathy and draw they knew immediately the intensity of the pregnant young woman in the draw she was a student in your English class Reina Angelica mata ki.
From El Salvador this lady almost immediately went to cheer.
She told us that she knew angelic American that she was the one of the more lovely people that you have no.
And that she disappeared thirty years ago Kathie Andrade never knew what happened to our friend ray not a keen although she feared she had met with foul play and I was in shock and I said oh my god.
Bring americain came to the United States in nineteen sixty six and lived here in a modest room in a Catholic home for single women.
She attended classes at the high school of fashion industry and got a job at the Melrose plastic company making artificial flowers she had a beautiful personality the service took about her family and she was in touch with the family how much you love New York I had dream was to become an American citizen shortly before she disappeared Reina told Kathy she was pregnant but she did not tell her who the father is is he going to marry you she said eventually will marry me.
I never as well because she never said who he was but Reina told Kathy that her boyfriend was married with three other children and rain it was beginning to question whether he had any intention of leaving his wife and children to marry her so she got very angry she called the house.
And the ones the phone with his wife.
And she told his wife that she was expecting a baby.
Then he called her back and he says I am going to kill you.
I will never forgive you she was great she was starting price is going to give me is going to kill me I said why do you choose I don't know I don't know I just made a stupid mistake.
When Kathie Andrade went to reign as apartment she found the door unlocked there was no sign of rain.
And I waited for about three hours when nobody return the phone never run or anything like that skin hi welcome to the police station and I spoke to the officer.
And he said you a relative of the lady I said normally a friend.
And I suppose you spinach is about to have a baby she said you know she brought when shopping and since Kathy and dry they didn't know the identity of rain as a lover there was little more she could tell police.
Investigators believe that Howard Elkins lowered rain into the factory one night shortly after she told elle Ken's wife about their affair and.
He then took the body to his suburban Long Island home probably with the intention of dumping her into the ocean from his boat.
To make sure it would sink to the bottom of the ocean.
Waited with plastic.
But he miscalculated the weight of the drum after resealed three hundred fifty pounds it was much too heavy to carry on with.
His only alternative was to push it into a crawl space in his home and there it remained undisturbed through numerous donors for thirty four years.
As children go to school and lead whatever as normal life you can you know waiting for the other shoe to drop.
And if trash collectors hadn't refused to pick up the drum the secret of Howard Elkins and Reina Angelica mera keen might never have been discovered.
Mr corralled covered the story for Newsday he flew down to El Salvador to try to find rain is family.
In St Martin a small village outside of San Salvador he found rain americain's ninety five year old mother she came out to the front of the house with a porch and I said to her I'm a reporter from Newsday New York I told her that police had discovered a woman who had been murdered thirty years ago and when she saw her daughter's picture she almost fainted she had to lean on somebody who's carrying her face fell she immediately began to weep.
Thirty years that this woman waited for an answer she told me she had dreams about her daughter for thirty years she told me she had a dream even that her daughter was in a barrel.
That haunted her for so long.
Bring Amanda Keane left El Salvador because she discovered her husband had a lover who was pregnant with her husband's child.
When she fled to New York City Reina found herself in the same situation although this time she was the pregnant other woman in a love triangle that had disastrous consequences so she was on.
Both sides of the fence in this case and in the end it cost her her life.
Investigators found one last message on a blank piece of paper found in the drum alongside reign in Marikina enter on born child.
A message possibly from Rainer herself to Howard Elkins.
Don'T be mad.
