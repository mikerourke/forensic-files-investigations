During high school Russell stater was a popular baseball coach in driver's education teacher a man respected by faculty and students alike.
Jennifer Joyner was one of rust's takers students all the kids who needed advice or needed someone to talk with about their problems coach digger his door was always open and he just meant a lot to the kids there after college Russ digger married his high school sweetheart Joe Lynn.
Russ was a very gentle compassionate.
Caring full of life.
He had a very tender heart unfortunately Staiger wasn't as successful in his personal life as he was in his professional life after four years of marriage Russ and Joel and divorce.
Less than a year later Russ married a thirty one year old widow Barbara for the adopted her two sons Brian and Jason.
Token barber sons as his own he love them care for them and treated them like like they were his own sons.
Barbara worked as a secretary at Duke University Medical Center.
Russ continued to teach and coach.
He worked weekends in the National Guard and with his new wife Barbara taught Sunday school in their church.
By all outward appearances Rustin Barbara sticker lived a storybook life.
But all that changed in the early morning hours of February first nineteen eighty eight.
Just as the night shift was ending police got an emergency call of a shooting at the sticker home.
Rus sticker was found sprawled on his bed with a bullet to the back of his head.
He died three hours later in the hospital.
She kept saying she kept making the comment I kept telling him about those damn gun so I kept telling him about those damn guns.
Barbara Staiger said that Ross slept with the twenty five caliber pistol under his pillow because of some recent burglaries in the neighborhood.
Just before dawn barber said she was awakened when one of her sons went into the bathroom.
Barbara was worried that Russ might mistake her son for a problem.
So she tried to remove the pistol from underneath rass hello.
When she did the gun accidentally fired shooting Ross in the back of the head.
The death was ruled an accidental shooting.
He was a mentor he was a baseball coach he was a likable guy to so many children at a door in high school and they felt a sense of loss they felt a sense of shock they felt a sense of disbelief what has happened to the guy that we love.
History had unfortunately repeated itself in a bizarre incidents barbarous first husband had died in a shooting accident two he was cleaning his twenty five caliber pistol when it accidentally went off shooting himself in the chest.
A few hours after rest acres death detective Rick Buchanan went to the stagger home to ask some routine questions.
Since the death had been ruled accidental the bedding was not considered evidence.
It was Buchanan's first interview with Barbara steak.
She was a little withdrawn perhaps but she was not overly friendly she was not.
it all way through the interview Baber Staiger repeated her account of her husband's death saying the gun went off accidentally as she pulled it from under her husband's hello she told me you cannot turn nine years of marriage to rusted been happy that he was a great father to her two young boys something what rights I could put my finger on it.
I don't know exactly what it was.
But it still wasn't enough.
To to indicate anything other in accidental shooting.
The news of rust takers death was particularly troubling to his first wife Joanne memory action wise it was no accident and that's what I said to my parents and I remember my dad said you can't narrow that it was no accident you can suspect but you can't narrow and I said now I wanna.
That it was no accident.
Joe Lynn wrote a letter to police because Ross often confided in her.
Rush told her that Barbara removed large sums of money from their bank account and the suspected Barbara was having sexual affairs with other men.
He had once caught her kissing another man in a parking lot.
When investigators looked into Barbara stickers background they learned some surprising information about her first marriage.
Our first husband had died in bed and was killed at the business end of a twenty five caliber pistol.
And so now we have a lady who's had two husbands killed in bed with a twenty five caliber gun and on both occasions she was present.
Barbara'S first husband Larry Ford had been cleaning his twenty five caliber pistol when it accidentally discharged shooting him in the chest.
Although the death of Larry Ford had been ruled an accident his family vigorously fought to have the case investigated as a possible merger but the ruling was never changed.
Barbara inherited Larry for its entire estate and suspicions remain.
Investigators now had another suspicious death and more questions about the same woman.
I desperately wanted to know that trace I wanted a full blown investigation if it was accidental I wanted that to be nine.
But if it was not accidental as I say suspected I wanted that to come out today ninety percent of what we do is common sense and then we apply a ten percent a law.
Was it possible barbarous taker was not on lucky at all.
But was in fact a serial killer.
The death of Barbara stickers first husband Larry Ford by an accidental self inflicted gunshot wound to the chest had officially been declared an accident and after ten years the case has long been forgotten.
But shortly before his death.
It had clearly been on the mind of rust STACR Barbara's second husband Russ stager told his ex wife killed in that he feared for his own life.
He also knew that her first husband had died under somewhat mysterious circumstances and so when he put all of that together I think he.
He was a little concerned for his safety but it was mostly he felt paranoid.
According to Barbara STACR the gun under her husband's pillow had gone off accidentally she tried to remove.
Barbour said the gun had a hair trigger and that she had barely touched it before it went off.
Firearms expert Eugene bishop performed what's known as a trigger pull test on the gun.
Weights are attached to the trigger in one pound increments to measure the force required to pull the trigger.
The gun had a four pound trigger pull.
Which is no hair trigger.
Deliberate force would be required to fire the gun.
Contradiction of Barbara stickers story.
In the autopsy medical investigators discovered another discrepancy the trajectory of the fatal bullet was not consistent with Barbara stickers account the bullet struck Russ diggers had in a downward angle.
Barbara claimed that the gun fired as she pulled out from under the pillow.
Which would have sent the bullet in an upward trajectory the angles trajectory.
What indicate that she was above and behind us when the shot was fired so it was the the autopsy should was inconsistent with the story she was telling.
Eugene bishop test fired the pistol and found that a dejected shell casings to the right rear of the shooter which may.
If Barbara's version was correct the shell casing should have been found somewhere in the middle of the back.
Look at the crime scene pictures of the car just case itself where was laying on the bed it could not have been fired as she said it was far.
When any firearm is discharged dust oil and gun powder are expelled from the barrel.
If Barbara's version was correct.
The sheets have been removed by Barbara's father immediately after the shooting and had been laundered but residue you can be identified even after fabrics have been washed.
When the streets were examined scientists found no evidence of gun powder residue.
With the detective playing the part of rust STACR barbarous digger recreates her version of the story I don't know how it was in my hand I have no idea if I touch I don't know I don't know and almost immediately she realizes there are inconsistencies.
And she can't do it.
I was no doubt at all.
That she intentionally shot and killed last by.
No doubt whatsoever.
Police also doubted that Russ digger a member of the United States National Guard with weapons training would have placed a loaded pistol under his pillow with the safety turned off and talked with the round already in the chamber.
This along with Barbara stickers video tape recreation was enough to convince investigators that Russ Baker's death was no accident but investigators were not prepared for the next clue in the case a message from the victim himself gross January twenty ninth nineteen eighty eight.
What evidence was mounting that rust stickers death was not the accident claimed by his wife Barbara but if she had killed him in cold blood as police suspected they needed to find the motive for that they looked into the couple's financial records though the stickers had a modest income Ross was a school teacher Barbara secretary Barbara was known for spending extravagantly and the couple was deeply in debt we learn the more we had.
In this apparently was without Russ's knowledge.
to be credit card debt among other things.
Records of the stickers bank transactions were sent to forensic document examiner what Mateen.
He compared Russ Baker is known signatures to signatures found on that second bank loan as well as as well.
Which had been revised only months before his death they brought to me we'll make some checks and other documents that we're signing with the name Russell stater but that it was not his signature.
It was actually forged checks where Russ staggers account was being drawn upon in the money was being deposited in barber staggers account so all the financial evidence tended to show that barber was in debt and rusted not know about it.
The beneficiary of the forged a life insurance policy with a payout of a hundred seventy thousand dollars was none other than his wife Barbara steak.
The final piece of evidence in the case came from a most unlikely source.
During high school one of rustic your students was cleaning a gym locker when he came upon a cassette tape.
The voice on the tape was one he recognized immediately.
January twenty.
Nineteen eighty eight.
On the tape.
Why did his belief that his wife Barbara was planning to kill him.
Russ stager went on to question the allegedly accidental death of Barbara's first husband.
I don't know what happened but according to his parents there was some file political in the.
Accidentally shot himself.
I had never ever.
Experienced anything quite like that in prosecution where you try a case a person for homicide and yet the victim who you represent.
Who has no voice in the court room is now telling you what he is feeling experiencing and worried about a media leak prior to his execution so to speak investigators now had both evidence and motive.
Barbarous taker was arrested on a charge of first degree murder.
Prosecutors believe the barbarous taker had been planning her husband's death four weeks.
First with poison and when that was unsuccessful with the gun.
Shortly before dawn prosecutors believe that Barbara remove the twenty five caliber hand gun from its usual place in the dresser drawer.
Walked over to her sleeping husband.
The bullet entered at a downward angle.
She was also standing above the bed which explains the lack the powder burns on the bed.
To stage the scene.
A substantial casing just inches from her husband's head which was a mistake if the gun went off as he pulled the bill okay she claimed the shell casing would have objected to the right towards the foot of the bed.
The angle of the bullet the placement of the shell casing the lack of powder burns the forged wheels and life insurance policy and.
Jamming of the rust steak predicting his own murder on audio tape made a compelling case to draw.
And you can't prosecute theory and speculation you've got to have physical evidence.
Barbara Steiger was found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to death.
The sentence was later reduced to life in prison after an appeals.
I think those of us who cared so deeply for us ranted and raved and felt this was so unfair to take someone so special and so kind and you there's there's never an answer to one there's there's never an answer to why.
Prosecutors also suspect that Barbara stager was responsible for her first husband's death but with our current life sentence they see no need for further prosecution.
This case was a terrible tragedy.
They'Re gone forever because the criminal conduct a barber steak.
And our court system worked in and cover the truth.
A verdict was rendered justice was done.
