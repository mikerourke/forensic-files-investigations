It identifies a prostitute told police that some local drug dealers may have killed someone in her basement but police could find no evidence of violence in the home.
The only clue investigators found was a piece of use chewing khat scientist wondered whether it would help solve the mystery.
Easton Pennsylvania is the first city you come to when driving from New York City on the new interstate highway route seventy eight.
By day Easton proudly displays its picturesque downtown and colonial era architecture.
By night drug dealers strolled the streets since they can make more money than in New York City they can do better here less competition maybe not as a violent scene as in New York in New Jersey and so it's been a magnet and the easy access and with the drug traffic has come an increase in violence.
On August fifth nineteen ninety six a prostitute Kathy said gusty ran to a neighbor's home saying she'd been stabbed in the arm by two local drug dealers Kathy suggests the she was known to us from some prostitution arrests and one of our other local PT's had also had around so my credit card matters she was basically a crack cocaine addict who is doing prostitution and petty crimes the supporter habit so gusty identified her attackers as nineteen year old Corey Mayweather and twenty year old climb a Henry.
So gusty said they had been doing drugs together and she was stabbed in the arm after a minor dispute and during her interview so dusty reluctantly told police another story about an incident that happened in her home just one week earlier.
She said the same to drug dealers cari may weather and Kwame Henry along with the third man Stanley boss came to our home with a nineteen year old woman matter Ron Smith.
Right Smith was a drug runner the man suspected of stealing two thousand dollars worth of cocaine.
What was going on down.
After they took Smith to the basement suggesting heard Smith cry.
So gusty admitted she was using drugs at the time and never saw what happened but she believed that Smith had been murdered.
She said the three men later carried a large box from her basement.
She relayed about a fight and they went to the basement and she heard screams and cries from this girl and then silence and then she related that she never saw this girl again as we canvassed the neighborhood we wound up finding some people at a at a local business some secretaries were looking out the window and I saw three black males carrying a large heavy box and really struggling with it.
But police were suspicious for a number of reasons first they could find no traces of blood or evidence of violence and Kathy sego skis basement and second they could find no record of any nineteen year old woman by the name of matter on Smith.
When police arrested Corey may weather for the stabbing of Kathy said gusty he denied any knowledge of matter Ron Smith or her whereabouts.
Without a body or any corroborating forensic evidence all police had to go on with the suspicions of an admitted drug user.
Two weeks had passed since Kathy suggested told police about the nineteen year old woman mataron Smith whom she suspected was murdered in her basement.
In a cemetery near cigar stays home a worker noticed an unusual smell coming from a burial vault.
Real vaults had once been used to store bodies during the winter months when the ground was too hard and cold to dig the graves.
But this burial vault had long since been abandoned inside the man made a gruesome discovery.
Underneath some newspapers was the partially close badly decomposed body of a black female.
Inside that house at the time there was a very follower of decomposition there was thousands of flies flying around and several thousand maggots were crawling over the floor and over the body one hand was wrapped with twine and apparent restraining device the victim's pants were down around her ankles she was about five foot two and approximately a hundred and ten pounds the newspapers that covered the body for many weeks old and we're no help in identifying the time of death the fault had been bolted from the outside which provided some important information about the possible cause of death she could not have put herself in the dead house and then.
Put a bolt on the outside of the door.
And so we knew that she had to have been placed there by someone else the manner of death was homicidal violence that you surely die from an accident or natural causes I was some act of homicide but we could not say whether her throat was cut because the throat area had been eaten away by maggot infestation and it was no way to to to to make give an opinion we couldn't say whether she was stabbed we couldn't say whether she was strangled.
The system the body was that of matter on Smith the nineteen year old drug runner Cathy said gusty suspected had been murdered in her house the forensic test quickly dispelled that notion this victim was much younger than nineteen years old an analysis of her teeth indicated she was an early puberty I believe she was thirteen we can be able to tell from the level of eruption of certainty that you know that was consistent with somebody who might have been thirteen at the time even though I don't believe she had a baby teeth left to find out when the victim died scientists turn to the only evidence they had the insects that were on the dead body some of the species of flights will be found almost immediately after death within a matter of seconds the matter of a few minutes after death they'll be laying eggs within the first two hours three hours after death giving given the the adequate and environmental conditions if it's eighty degrees it's a nice summer day and and we have sunlight to daylight the flights will be out searching and if you die they're going to find you very very fast.
Dr Haskell discovered that the larvae on the body with third stage when he allowed some of these larvae to develop into full maturity he discovered that the species was for me Regina otherwise known as the black blow fly a species common in rural areas during the summer.
If doctor Haskell could determine how long the larvae had been on the body he would know when the victim died the temperature and weather conditions can affect insect development and must be taken into account if we have temperatures in the eighties or nineties or pushing one hundred those maggots were grown adults very very fast so it is critical to have the weather information to evaluate to see whether that growth environment is slow medium or fast.
Dr Haskell research local temperatures in the weeks and months preceding discovery of the body he also needed to calculate the difference between the outside temperatures and those inside the vault which were much cooler.
So he took temperature readings inside the vault and correlated them with the outside temperatures with these calculations and knowing the larvae were in their third stage of development Dr Haskell estimated that blow flies deposited their eggs on the dead body between July twenty seventh and the twenty ninth.
This was the same time Kathy said gusty suspected the murder took place in her basement.
If the victim wasn't nineteen year old matter on Smith's.
When police discovered the decomposed body of a young woman in a deserted cemetery vault they had few clues to her identity an analysis of the victim's teeth revealed she was just thirteen years old.
Police conducted a nationwide computer search on all missing thirteen year old black females who were five foot two and a hundred and ten pounds.
Chester Williams was one of the matches Chester Williams was a run away from a middle class family in Long Island New York and was reported missing by her family a few weeks earlier.
When her dental records were compared to the teeth of the victim there were similarities was it difficult situation but fortunately she had some chipping of her upper front teeth and we noticed that when we examine the remains it was also chipping on the upper front teeth and they matched up remarkably well and the conclusion was within a high degree of dental certainty that that individual was because Williams.
When Kathy's a gusty was shown the photographs of rich has a Williams she confirmed that she was the woman she knew as a nineteen year old matter on Smith's.
Williams had changed her age and identity after she ran away from home.
For Sandra Taylor Richards is teacher and girl scout leader news of her death came as a shock I had no idea no idea that all.
she would eventually go somewhere in polls to be nineteen instead of thirteen which says those are exceptionally beautiful young girl.
Full black flowing along here very pleasant for anybody to look like look at you know just gorgeous you know nice personality very friendly all friendly to everybody people she knew people she didn't know after it chose a finished grade school she didn't attend middle school regularly her father died choose a started to rebel and became a discipline problem I had a conversation with which has a myself and I told her you must go to school and I told her also that if she did not I would go I was going to have her move in with me and I would see that she went to school and I would pick her up and make sure she went there so I knew there was some kind of problems going on there.
Instead we chose a Williams got involved running drugs between New York and Pennsylvania which is how she met Corey may weather com a Henry and Stanley boss.
Over the next several hours Mayweather and Henry took several items from the kitchen before returning to the basement.
The second stint could not tell us what happened out there but she did hear sounds of crying from rich as a don't do this to me you know she heard sort of like slapping around and that this young girl was pleading with them to stop whatever they were doing down there at some point all the noise stopped in the basement.
A search of the gusty is home corroborated parts of her story several kitchen utensils tested positive for human enzymes leading to speculation that they were used as implements of torture.
Here is consistent with the Chester Williams were also found in the basement well the case was a circumstantial evidence case really from the outset although we had a Kathleen see gusty who was able to tell us that she knew the three men that she saw which has a Williams in her home on about this time frame the end of July time frame no one could actually say what happened in that basement.
With no forensic evidence connecting the three men to rich has a Williams murder police returned to the cemetery vault a few weeks after the body was discovered.
With screens they sifted through all the debris on the floor of the vault.
They found something unusual.
A used piece of chewing gum.
Been there probably for ten days or so maybe even fifteen days before we found it so when we found that it was it was hard as a rock and wound up being very well preserved the gum was read and about an inch and a half long it was completely dried out and appeared to have the imprint of teeth marks.
There was more news for investigators Corey Mayweather had more than just a drug habit he had a habit of constantly chewing big red brand gun and carry packs of it wherever he went.
Police also remembered he was chewing big red gum when they questioned him about bridge has a Williams murder the question now was whether it would work as evidence.
A used piece of chewing gum founded in the burial vaults near Chester Williams body was the only piece of evidence that could tie Corey Mayweather and his two accomplices to the merger.
The gun was sent for DNA testing to see if it contains saliva that could be matched to one of the suspects but almost immediately investigators realize they had made a mistake the DNA test required scientists to remove a piece of the gun which would alter or destroy the teeth marks fortunately investigators retrieved the gun before DNA testing started and sent it instead to a forensic odontology just for analysis preserving the gum without altering it presented a daunting challenge to Dr Dennis ason I think the problem the face me that time is how do we make a copy of this chewing up without distorting the evidence without destroying the evidence after freezing the chewing gum doctor ace and attempted to make a copy by mixing together a plastic derivative known as an alginate he place the alginate mixture into a mold and then place the frozen piece of gum on top of it when he removed the frozen gone it left an impression in the mold essentially a negative copy into that impression he injected a substance called a poly vinyl which hardens quickly but remains flexible this process produces a permanent virtually indestructible duplicate what's known as an exemplar of the piece of gum found at the crime scene.
The next step was to compare that exemplar with the cast of Corey Mayweather's teeth.
As if trying to match a piece of the jigsaw puzzle he ran the exemplar over the cast and found a perfect match.
Mr Mayweather had a little cross bite was one tooth that was out of line they created a bit of a step and a ledge in his dentition and in the gum there is this step or ledge and that was the the focal point we were able to see the gum it was very very clear.
Dr ason believes that the gum fell from Mayweather's mouth when he carried rate shows that Williams body into the vault spitting it out would have distorted the bite marks.
Prosecutors believe that the man brought Chester Williams to suggest these home to confront her about the missing cocaine.
While in the basement the man tortured her with various items they found in the kitchen.
The lack of blood in the basement told investigators that rich has a Williams most likely had been strangled.
Williams body was undoubtedly inside the large cardboard box the three men carried from said dusty's basement as they headed in the direction of the nearby cemetery.
But Corey Mayweather is mistake was the chewing gum that accidentally fell from his mouth as he carried Rick Chester Williams body into the cemetery fault proving he was inside the vault when the body was dumped.
The insect activity on the body told forensic scientist to win rich has a Williams had been murdered which coincided with the date Kathy said gusty lasts all Williams in her home.
The blowfly larvae the chewing gum and cigar Steve's testimony all pointed to Corey may weather as the merger.
I don't think he gave up until the the bite mark evidence came back that's that's really kind of what's on his boat.
They they hired their own expert who basically came to the same conclusion we did get some very unique dentition and.
Just kind of sold the case.
It really supports the fact that how important crime scene evidence is and how.
You know the time needs to be taken to examine the scene thoroughly and look for every little piece of evidence it may be something as simple as a piece of commerce Europe but that helps you to identify who suspect maybe and in this case it proved to be positive.
The decision not to test the gum for DNA until after the dental analysis was a huge break for investigators DNA tests conducted later on the gun for saliva were inconclusive had the DNA testing been done first the dental impressions would have been destroyed and prosecutors would have lost the only positive forensic evidence against Corey may weather in October of nineteen ninety eight.
Mayweather pleaded guilty to first degree murder and avoided the death sentence he was sentenced to life in prison he also implicated his two accomplices Kwame Henry was not apprehended until several years later in Trinidad and was also sentenced to life in prison Stanley boss has never been apprehended and is still at large.
Those who investigated this case were gratified by the outcome but are still haunted by the fate of a beautiful thirteen year old girl who strayed despite the best efforts of family and friends you know she still someone's child right and the kids just get you know rather strong headed sometimes it way had other years and unfortunately she got in way over had and.
Should personal never have a second chance to you know writer mistakes.
Since this tragedy happened believe you me I have put this into my curriculum and I talk about it in classroom and I talk about it in chapel service with the children to let them know when you leave here you have to be aware of wolves in sheep clothing in the Bible speaks of that so I have to let them know what happened in this situation so that it won't happen again.
