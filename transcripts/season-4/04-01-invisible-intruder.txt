On June sixth nineteen ninety six in a suburb of Dallas Texas there was a crime of unprecedented holler an intruder entered this home and attacked two young children along with their mother.
Darren and Darley routine here where a young couple in their mid twenties with three children six year old Devin five year old Damon and eight month old Drake.
Darren root tear was a successful entrepreneur Darley stayed at home to care for the children this was a young couple who had made good Derren owned his own business in nineteen ninety five he had made close to three hundred thousand dollars in his business he repaired mainframe computers had some extensive contracts with government agencies.
On the night of the attack Darren route.
Stairs in the family two older boys fell asleep watching television.
Around two thirty in the morning.
After a brief struggle the intruder fled.
Call the police.
Paramedics arrived six year old dad was dead.
Five year old Damon was barely alive.
But he died on route to the hospital.
Charlie was taken into surgery to repair her neck wound which Mr carotid artery by only two centimeters she also suffered a stab wound to work on.
Paramedics noticed Darnley's panties were missing when I asked her she thought she'd been raped her answer to me was what when I woke up I felt some pressure down there.
Dawaly described the assailant as a white male about six feet tall wearing a black shirt jeans and a baseball cap.
In the alley two houses away police discovered a bloody sock.
The motive did not appear to be a rock.
The twenty kitchen the room of the murders occurred there's thirteen rings and gold ladies watch line out there so it indicated us if it was in fact a burglary or robbery that had gone bad there's nothing there's valuables out there to be taken and nothing was disturbed now we don't know why now we know that this is a sick individual that took absolutely nothing from our house but took both the two most important things that were important to us away from us.
The most prominent evidence at the crime scene was blood.
For rent six scientists hoped the blood spatter pattern would tell them more about these horrific murders.
When police examined the murder scene.
The assailant entered the room to your home through a screen to windows in the garage.
Dawaly routiers said she was asleep in the intruder murdered her two boys Donnelley woke when she felt a knife to her throat there was a struggle and the assailant fled through the garage.
Donnelly said he dropped the murder weapon on to the floor on his way out.
Darren routiers said he was asleep upstairs with eight month old Drake and woke when he heard glass breaking.
When he walked into the family room where the detectives were waiting for him the first thing out of his mouth was not how is Damon how historically it is have you seen Darley isn't she beautiful and doesn't she have gorgeous breast there and said you know I can see why somebody came in good looking good looking blonde you know thirty eight double days frost thought that was a little strange to considering he just lost both of his sons and I don't believe at that time he knew for for a fact of Darling was gonna labor not.
In the kitchen.
Noticed a set of white handled knives one space was empty.
The murder weapon a ten inch white handled knife came from the routiers home kitchen.
The blood drops on the floor were photographed and collected for DNA testing the size and shape of the blood droplets would be analyzed to see if they were consistent with Charlie's version of a fan.
Donnelly'S night shirt was another important piece of evidence forensic scientists hope that it would provide information about the merger.
DNA testing of the bloody socks found in the alley revealed the blood was that of the two boys Devin and Dave.
However police bloodhounds were not able to track the intruders sent beyond the location of the sock why would an intruder leave a murder weapon by hand in a house and yet take a shot down the alley.
Why would an intruder leave this sock in open view for the police to fan instead of disposing of it in a garbage can or down a storm sewer drying police found some other inconsistencies Darley said she chased the intruder through the kitchen and he knocked a wine glass on the floor but pieces of glass were on top of the blood drops on the floor and there were no cuts on Darley street.
Underneath the overturned vacuum cleaner was more blood spatter and the wheel impression in the block.
It appeared the Dalai ran from the kitchen before the glass broke and the vacuum cleaner overturned on the handle of the vacuum cleaner was a blood stain.
DNA tests revealed it was darlings the blood dripped onto the handle at an eighty degree angle as if Donnelly were leaning over the back.
The pattern was not consistent with Darlene's running past the vacuuming she told police.
Either Darling root tear was mistaken about what happened in the kitchen or she knew more about the murders and she was telling police.
Blood spatter expert Tom Bevil was asked to analyze the blood drops found in the route to your home as co author of the well known textbook on blood pattern analysis it was devil's job to interpret the story told by the blood trail.
Bevel noticed the blood drops on the kitchen floor were circular in shape.
Deposited by someone standing still or walking very slowly.
Charlie said she was stabbed on the sofa and wild leading ran from the kitchen after her assailant.
Running would have produced blood drops more elliptical in shape usually with the tape indicating the path and direction of the person running.
Charlie also told police that the intruder dropped the knife on the kitchen floor.
Tom Bevil could find no evidence of that numerous people to include myself examined that floor to try and find evidence of a night drop either even pointed straight down or falling on its handle or falling on the side or whatever and we were unable to to find anything would be consistent with that if it had as much blood on it as it was found which you would have to then it should have produced an outline of the night for evidence of the night dropping onto the floor and we simply didn't find.
Barry Dickey is a forensic audio expert assigned to analyze dollies telephone calls to police.
In order to conduct his analysis sticky isolated Darling's voice by eliminating all of the background noise.
In my opinion Darley had moved from it least three different rooms in the house in these rooms were moved in a very rapid fashion and she did not stay in any one of the ambiance is very long.
Don briskly between rooms this contradicted her story police.
When police interviewed Ali after the merger she was holding a wet towel to renege.
Police wondered if the title had been used to clean up the block before they arrived.
To find out investigators used luminol a chemical that glows when sprayed on an area where blood has been removed.
Once we darkened kitchen down in applied luminal we were able to see footprints there in front of the St.
which kind of made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.
The foot prints in front of the kitchen sink or Darling.
On the cabinet beneath the sink it was visible blocked and luminal revealed that Moore had been cleaned up before police arrive blood evidence in front of the sink indicated to us that someone had landed stand there in front of St first significant amount of time bleeding and not moving around there was blood drops on top of blood drops on the floor in front of the same DNA testing revealed the blood belonged to Darley.
Prosecutors suspected that it was here where Darley cut her neck and arm there wasn't a traitor and he came in he came in without leaving any evidence of walking through there also on the cockpit was an unusual blood impressions the distinct outline of the murder weapon the heavy line of blood near the tip of the blade told forensic experts something important about the killer the only way that I am aware that you could get something coming off of the knife in the in that manner as we found it would be to have the knife in the hand of a person that is bleeding all the words they are contributing blood continuously so if you had a wound on this arm with the knife in his hand with the blood flowing down the arm ultimately crossed the Han and then down the blade of the knife that will produce that very heavy bleeding that we got in the front of the night in the impression coincidentally Darley had a knife wound on her right on DNA tests revealed that the blood was that of both Damon and Darling and not that of an unknown assailant.
Donnelly said she picked up the knife from the kitchen floor and put it on the counter she said nothing about taking it into the family room.
The bloody trail no fingerprints no traces of social.
Peter Pan came down the chimney.
Evidence of anyone coming through the window committed murder.
Police were now convinced that there was no intruder in the room here home on the night of the murders.
Just eight days after the murders the routiers celebrated what would have been seven seventh birthday at the cemetery.
Family members invited a local television news crews.
We would now that there have been have then and they're out there having the biggest birthday party that we can ever imagine and they wouldn't want us to be down here band sad even though our hearts are breaking and now that Devin and Damon would want us to be happy.
District attorney Greg Davis watch the celebration on television.
I was just second but what I saw.
Because it'd only been a week since these boys deaths and yet we've got a full blown birthday party out there with the greats so.
And it really struck me as more than curious.
The Dallas County institute of forensic sciences Charles Lynch discovered the most damaging piece of evidence contradicting Charlie's intruder story on one of the bread knives from the routiers kitchen.
Lynch found a single fiberglass rod and some rubber dust the cut window screen on the route to your garage was made of poly vinyl chloride bundles the interior corner of that bundle was composed of fiberglass rods the fiberglass rod found on the kitchen knife was identical to the fiberglass rods from the roof two years three.
Lynch could not find any other source of fibre glass inside the route to your home that was similar.
They were the lemonade out other sources of fiber glass and I can find is being sourced so the conclusion is that the fiberglass rod found on the bread knife may have come from the windscreen but not to the exclusion of all other sources.
FBI profiler Allen Brantley was convinced there was snow in truth.
We have never seen a case when the thunder comes from outside the residence breaks into home takes a knife and then goes back outside the home cuts the screen to come back in.
Those steps that kind of behavior is just unnecessary to the commission of any kind of an offense unless you are attempting to make the scene look like something you think it should look like or that you want other people to believe her and and again that's an element of stage and on Darlene's night shirt scientists found castoff blood spatter on the back right shoulder area.
Some of those blood stains are coming in that direction consistent with the movement of the item that was blood stained in my opinion in this case the the knife as you're drawing the knife backward the blood is coming off of the end of the night as it's being thrown backwards and of course if it's close enough and it's still on an upward flight it will point in an upward direction with the the blood stains the blood spatter was pointed upwards consistent with the movement of a bloody knife in Darlene's right hand.
The forensic evidence all told a story a story quite different from the one Darley told police.
Prosecutors believe that the murders were premeditated and the Darling coverage the boys to sleep with her that night in the family room.
Sometime after two AM.
Lee took a bread knife from the kitchen and cut the screen then the garage.
She returned the knife to the holder without rinsing the fiberglass residue found later by forensic scientists.
Charlie used the largest knife she had to murder her two children.
Blood spatter on the back right shoulder over night shirt placed the murder weapon in Charlie's.
Speculation is the Darling they have removed her panties to suggest the possibility of a sexual assault.
Standing at the kitchen sink Darley turned the knife on herself slicing both her neck and right on.
Then something unexpected happened five year old Damon was still alive crawling through the family room.
He was then two more.
The audio analysis of the nine one one call reveals the Darley was moving between rooms quickly if she staged the crime scene and remove some of the blood evidence.
Darlene'S attempt to mislead investigators failed.
It'S hard to explain it but.
These kids are in her way.
They were in the way of her lifestyle and her ambitions and what she wanted to do and she simply made a decision that those children would no longer be on her way.
Darlene tear was arrested and charged with the murder of her two sons Darin routier denied he was involved and no charges were filed against him.
A Tricia Springer describes the possible motive in her book flesh and blood there is no one reason why Darby tear did this is a combination of things it had nothing to do with money it had to do with the multiple births with the total responsibility we've learned since then that Darren really didn't help a lot with the children they painted this picture of the perfect family and how great they were in everything they did was as a family but the family life was an illusion that day perpetrated on anyone that would listen to it Charlie Rose tear was found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to death.
She currently sits on death row awaiting execution.
Texas is a pretty conservative state and I want everybody to know that you can't go out to our children expect we'll I think the Darley.
I got exactly what she deserved in this case.
We probably gave her more justice than she deserved in this case.
if you look at the barbaric acts.
We did all the time that the system allows us to do to her but she richly deserves to be on death row and she richly deserves to be executed on the.
