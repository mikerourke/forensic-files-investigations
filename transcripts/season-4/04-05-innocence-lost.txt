Some time during the neighborhood Christmas party in nineteen eighty nine five year old Melissa Brannen disappeared.
We had a great time.
You know none of the adults or other children at the party saw where she went or noticed anything unusual.
It took science to see what witnesses did not.
Tammy Brannen and her five year old daughter Melissa had moved from Texas into this suburban apartment complex in Lorton Virginia.
Tammy was a single mother recently divorced working as an accountant and beginning a new phase in her life.
Tell me is a very good mother she's a very sweet very caring person kept yourself more or less you know she wasn't.
What I would call extremely outgoing although she did participate in just about everything one of the attractive features of the apartment complex was the active social program for the residents every Friday night with some sort of social gathering in the clubhouse and during the holidays there were special events.
The night of December third at the Christmas party that's something that they they basically did for almost every holiday people look forward to it they always had a nice layout within the clubhouse and people spent time getting to know their neighbors.
Tammy Brannen enter daughter Melissa both attended that Christmas party in nineteen eighty nine all together about two hundred residents of the complex were there everybody was very upbeat having a very good time the children played with each other all through the night going around and snatch and all the food and having a good time.
When it was time to leave Tammy asked Melissa to get their coats.
Packages shortly after handing the cult to our mother Melissa disappeared.
In the utility room off the lobby marked private a full length windows leading to the outside was wide open the windows faced a wooded area behind the apartment complex its possibility somebody could have gone out the window and not been seen by anybody outside it's a merry works included for the inside party goers would have seen anybody exempted on the wall so.
Your fax county police search the entire area and questioned everyone who attended the party it was very cold out that night it was pretty imperative that we try to locate us quickly as possible it's hard to imagine a young child was address on a small coat surviving term for that night.
Although no one at the party noticed anything unusual police feared that Melissa had been abducted.
Tammy Brannen pleaded for her daughter's safe return during a televised news conference.
What role police could find no trace of five year old Melissa brown and despite the help of hundreds of volunteers.
Hundreds of police officers down there we had hundreds of people from the military bases with people volunteering their airplanes and helicopters the search was phenomenal it just showed how this case touched so many people.
Yellow ribbons were placed throughout the neighborhood a symbol of concern and hope for Melissa safe return.
Police questioned Melissa's father who was in Texas on the night of Melissa's disappearance he was immediately ruled out as a suspect also ask that the person who took my daughter can hear me.
Please let her go.
We love her very much.
If anyone has any information that may help please contact someone.
Police question everyone who lived at the apartment complex as well as all of the employees.
Caleb Hughes worked at the apartment as a maintenance man and attended the Christmas party.
Police interviewed Hughes at his home a few hours after the party around two AM.
I'M sergeant Garcia from the Fairfax police department.
Like to ask a couple questions about the party at the apartment complex that you were they asked him where he had been since leaving the apartment complex.
I drove straight home stopped off for six pack got home about twelve thirty or one city stop just before you got home years house if you got home at twelve thirty quarter the one they stop selling beer in Virginia twelve o'clock so we didn't stop for beer he couldn't.
Did chores laundry study you know stuff like that.
Do you mind if we look around.
Now go ahead.
During the search police noticed something unusual.
Hughes told police he had been doing his laundry but the clothes he was washing with the ones he wore to the party you always want your speakers with a close Mr use.
So why would you wash all your clothes you don't have another pair of blue jeans and why would you wash your sneakers.
Caleb had no response.
The side diffuse sneakers had been shaved away although the sneakers had been washed tests showed traces of human protein possibly blood deep in the fibers.
Caleb Hughes wasn't cooperating either Hughes told police he did not speak to Melissa Brennan at the Christmas party but several witnesses contradicted.
Yes on the eve Caleb I think you know more I think you took Melissa all that part and Caleb would do is just sit there and finally Caleb said Pruitt.
But the straightest face and no emotional.
And that's what investigators set out to do.
Weeks passed and still there were no signs of five year old Melissa brown.
The community of Lorton Virginia held a candlelight vigil at the Brandon's apartment complex just a few feet from the clubhouse where Melissa was a doctor.
Bumper stickers yellow ribbons and flyers with malicious picture were everywhere.
It was all anybody talked about.
Because this wasn't one girl and one family this was any child all of our families.
If this could happen.
To Tammy Brannen starter this could happen to anyone's daughter and there was a desperate outcry to find who would have taken this child the remaining suspect was Caleb you.
Use attended the Christmas party but he denied having anything to do with Melissa's disappearance.
Around six scientists began their investigation with a look inside hues car the interior of the car it was cluttered with a lot of of debris dirt bags of books on dog hair I just looked outside holding are probably going to be able to find any type of evidence that would link Melissa to this car.
The car was sprayed with the chemical luminol which caresses when it comes into contact with the hemoglobin component of blood.
Luminol revealed blood on the steering wheel foot pedals and floor mats.
The blood was collected for DNA analysis but the results were inconclusive.
The car was also search for trace evidence specifically here and five.
And was sent to special agent Doug Dietrich of the FBI for analysis.
First thing that I do is look at the the tapings that came from the front seat of the car I trying to identify what types of materials are there and if possible anything that may have come from the victim if she had been in that car.
Dietrich discovered quite a bit of animal hair in the car most of the dog hair the three of the hairs from Hughes front seat were different.
That had been dyed black the rabbit here is were microscopically similar to a German rapid here code Tammy Brannen war to that Christmas party.
And Tammy brown was leaving the apartment she told Melissa together for coach Alyssa got the fur coat and as a child will do.
And of course lows.
The trick also discovered blue and red fibers on Hughes front passenger seat the red fibers were caught and extremely common fiber but the blue fibers were extremely rare the fifty blue fibers were man made an acrylic they were all the same shape length and diameter an indication they were from the same manufacturer.
Gas chromatography revealed that the blue fibers were died with the same blue dye but the chemical composition of the blues guy was unusual.
Melissa Brennan was wearing a blue sweater and red plaid skirt on the night she disappeared the outfit had been a gift from Melissa's grandmother could not recall where she bought all she could remember was that the sweater had a picture of Big Bird on it a character from the Sesame Street television series.
Prosecutors needed more evidence than the three rabbit hears from Mrs Brennan's code found in Caleb Hughes car.
They knew that good defense attorney would argue the Caleb Hughes could have brushed up against Tammy Brandon's code at the party and transferred those rabbit ears on to the seat of his car.
Doug Dietrich was convinced that the blue fibers held the key to Melissa Brandon's disappearance but there was no way to tell if the fibers were from Melissa's clothing.
After work one night Doug Dietrich shared his frustration with his wife he told her he needed to find the manufacturer of the outfit Melissa was wearing at the Christmas party some sort of blew away the poor thing or a.
Sesame Street outfit with a red plaid skirt I don't know anything about we needed to be processed me St that sold by JC Penney a second.
This is the trip had kept a number of store catalogs some going back a few years.
Red plaid skirt questions that she proceeded to bring a catalog down from the year before Christmas and sure enough on page eleven of that catalog there was an outfit that looked darn close to what they were describing to me is the one Melissa Brannen wore the night of her disappearance.
When Tammy Brannen was shown the picture from the catalog she identified it as the one Melissa was wearing at the party.
The F. B. I. S. J. C. Penney for one of the outfits in order to analyze the fibers but they were sold out the item was a catalog only item J. C. Penney sold all seven thousand garments in a matter of months but J. C. Penney located a customer in Kentucky who had purchased one of these outfits a year earlier the customer bought the outfit as a present for his granddaughter but it was the wrong size so it'd never been worn the customer sent the outfit to the FBI for analysis the idea of just being able to find an outfit that that's exactly the same outfit that affect the morning case that's an extremely good struggle log.
When Doug Dietrich examined the garment he made a startling discovery.
In J. C. Penney had this outfit manufactured they wanted to make it unique instead of using a standard die and there are ten thousand of them pennies decided to create a brand new color.
J. C. Penney specifies a particular color then the work with the dye manufacturer to find some combination of chemicals that we produce exactly that tone in this particular case they went in the divisional staff and make sure that it was a dye that nobody else had access to so that they could trade mark the sweater from its color point of view.
They call their new color com navy number eight eight seven J. C. Penney patented that signature dye and used it only once when they produced the seven thousand Big Bird sweaters.
They were the same.
With several hundred million people in the country and only seven thousand sweaters the probability of that particular sweater being located in individual cards very small place you can just work out the ratios of the two there's no question in my mind that that Melissa Brannen had been in the front seat of cal uses car where she went from there well I guess that a mystery right now.
The mystery police were desperately trying to solve.
The search for Melissa Brandon's body continued for almost a year statistics show that children abducted by strangers are usually murdered within three hours of the objection.
The prime suspect Caleb Hughes was asked to take a polygraph test.
Are you the one who adopted Melissa.
The results of this polygraph examination indicated deception as soon as he realized that I knew.
That he had failed that test he didn't want anything to do with that that room then went into with me.
Pretty much bolted out but there was a problem in the state of Virginia prosecutors must be able to prove where a homicide occurred.
Since the blood in Caleb Hughes automobile could not be identified as Melissa's prosecutors could not reach the threshold of homicide they could only prove kidnapping which carries a maximum sentence of only ten years but prosecutors were convinced that the blue and red fibers and Caleb Hughes Kerr indicated more than kidnapping.
The last time my brain and soul her daughter she was wearing the pink nylon coat winter coat over top of this Big Bird after.
If the child remained in that winter corrode any automobile.
You wouldn't have the collection on the population of blue acrylic fibers that are found on the street because they'd be inside the nylon coat.
Prosecutors believe that humans removed Melissa ski jacket in the car an indication that Hughes committed a sex.
And it seems to me the inference that flow from that are legitimate inferences of an intent to file.
While Melissa was waiting for her mother to say her goodbyes at the Christmas party.
Researchers believe that she left for a moment to get a drink from the water fountain in the hallway near the utility room.
News took Melissa through the window in the utility room and fled in his car.
Use remove Melissa ski jacket in the car closing the transfer of the blue and red fibers on to the front seat.
Also in the car they were three rabbit hears from Tammy Brandon's coat the one Melissa handed her mother seconds before she was abducted.
Where Hughes took Melissa Brannen and left her body remains a mystery.
Use track blood onto his foot pedals and floor mats from his sneakers luminol revealed blood on the car's steering wheel as well.
When humans arrived home he immediately washed his clothes in order to remove tray seven.
But he didn't remove evidence that he couldn't see.
The tiny fibers from Melissa's clothing left on the passenger seat of his car.
Caleb Hughes was arrested and charged not with kidnapping but with the introduction of Melissa Brannen with intent to defile her.
He was found guilty and sentenced to fifty years in prison without parole the maximum sentence Caleb Hughes has never confessed to the crime and the search for Melissa's body continues to this day.
Each piece of evidence no matter how small whether it's a car or whether it's a strand of DNA all have a story to tell where they've been they've been with how long they've been around and this is the type of information that that I look at and that I decipher and try to determine what value it has so one piece of evidence is can be significant when you add multiple pieces of this puzzle and you never get the whole puzzle you only get pieces you don't need the whole puzzle to see what that picture is going to say and in this case fifty five first look really ten cotton.
Jack rabbit ears to me it's overwhelming evidence for.
