When Bobby Hurley was brought to the hospital hallucinating and in extreme pain doctors could not find the calls.
At first they diagnosed a neurological problem.
But his condition deteriorated.
Something he was given in the hospital wasn't curing.
It was killing.
Thirty two year old Bobby currently was a young man with a ready smile many good friends and a loving family my brother Bobby he was a fun loving guy he really was he cared for his family very much myself and his mom and my other brother Dave he was just an all around great guy.
Body was a perfect brother a great brother.
In August of nineteen ninety.
A young with a with a four year old daughter.
Bobbie Ann Joanne had been dating for about a year following the death of Joanne's first husband in an automobile accident.
I gave him my blessing I said it was time for him to get married and have a life of its own.
They had a beautiful wedding Bob really wanted to meet a nice girl and start a family and just enjoy life.
And he said he really loved her I was very happy for Bob.
The couple moved into Joanne's home on a quiet street in Wilkes Barre Pennsylvania Bobby worked for the Morgan corporation as an electrician and in may of nineteen ninety one he and his crew started work on a major renovation project and a local chemistry lab.
Bottles of chemicals here stuff over there spilled in at the he was kinda.
No I thought hazardous.
Three months into the project Bobby became ill his brother noticed something was wrong when they met at a local bar one day after work after one beer he was ready to leave I asked him why and he said as he just didn't feel right his feet were burned for some reason and his feet hurt I had a hard time walking.
And I don't know what was it from Bobby also complained of numbness in his hands and pain in his feet when he went to the local hospital doctors diagnosed his illness as Keyon by race and drone a rare condition that causes numbness and weakness of the extremities although it can be serious most patients recover bodies condition gradually improved and he was released from the hospital but the pain returned this time even worse than before he was also vomiting.
He had to go to the bathroom I remember my sister I had literally carry him to the bathroom once we got him into the bathroom he looked at me and he said so please call the ambulance he knew he was that sick.
This time curly was taken to a regional Medical Center about a hundred miles away when he got there he was hallucinating and had to be restrained I thought maybe at one point that he would get better but he never did he got worse and worse he couldn't see if he could lay he could do everything was bothering him.
Although curly's blood tests were all normal doctor Donovan had a hunch and if he was correct Bobby Hurley was dying.
When Bobby currently was examined by doctors in the regional Medical Center his blood tests were all normal.
But his doctors noticed something that had previously been overlooked.
Bobby currently was losing his hair.
He had a had weakness and numbness in the extremities any particularly had had burning and pain on the soles of his feet which is a classical description of arsenic and thallium poisoning that coupled with the hair loss almost makes the diagnosis.
A special urine test confirmed doctor Donovan suspicion.
Early was suffering from Talion poisoning valium is a rare and highly toxic poison which doesn't show up in routine lab tests before it was banned in the United States in the early seventies valium was commonly used in rat poison it can take months to build up in the body before causing symptoms unfortunately there is no known antidote for thallium poisoning.
My first thought was could I save this patient unfortunately by the time I was involved in this case and the diagnosis was being established there was very little that can be done.
And I remember him.
Pointing to all his diplomas and everything else is certificates on his walls and saying all of these can't do anything for your brother he said there is just nothing that we can do your brother is going to die.
On September twenty sixth Bobby currently lapsed into a coma.
And there were no longer any signs of brain activity he was taken off life support.
We ordered we went I couldn't see Babi Cullen I could.
wasn't easy I talked to him who knows maybe you did here I don't know.
The autopsy confirmed the curly died of complications caused by having employees most likely one large dose.
Hospital officials notified the occupational safety and health administration to see if we could have been just at the valium while working at the chemistry lab one of these co workers believe the work site was on safe and one lab I found.
I don't think we should be going in there Diane can be ingested can be absorbed through the skin or can be inhaled so anyone of those routes could give you a poisoning type exposure.
To find out that Liam could've been accidentally ingested by workers in the lab.
Samples were collected countering shelf surfaces were swamped and dust and dirt samples were all taken for analysis.
Joann Curley told investigators that her husband had brought home some cabinets from the laboratory which were going to be discarded.
The cabinets were also tested for family.
The results of all of these tests were negative and none of the other electricians who worked with Bobby curly at the chemistry lab had valium in their systems.
Joann Curley requested a thali in test for herself.
Both Joanne and her four year old daughter Angela tested positive forth valley.
It was not enough to either cause symptoms or even to need treatment but it did indicate that there had been an explosion.
Investigators found traces of valium and released home they found it in two thermos is Bobby took with him to work every day thermos is usually held iced tea.
I did not know who.
Place the valium in the ice tea containers.
I cannot confirm that but I think that somebody certainly did and that caused his death and homicide is one person causing the death of another.
Police turned their attention to Bobby Hurley's co workers and the possibility of a practical joke gone bad.
When traces of valium were found in a thermos Bobby currently took to work police questioned his co workers yes me how will you get along with the other.
Was there any bad blood you have any arguments.
Stuff like that.
But the curly was only thirty two years old when he was named foreman of the electrical job the chemistry lab is promotion by past several older more experienced electricians was jealousy a possible motive.
Investigators also discovered that currently was sometimes the victim of practical jokes coworkers would sometimes laces food with seasonings as a joke early this is one of.
Several people had jokes played on him but it would be like hot pepper and chewing tobacco or things of that nature.
And it was theorized that possibly somebody put the valium and is iced tea mistaking it for valium.
Just to see what it would do to.
When investigators look closer at the furnaces and currently is home they found valium in the threads of the pint sized thermos that Bobby never took to work.
Join currently offered an explanation.
She recalled that once after her husband came home from work she poured some leftover ice tea from his work service in the smaller pint sized one so it wouldn't go to waste.
Joe and said that she and her daughter may have consume some of that ice tea later which would explain how the valium in their system.
Bobby curly's family grew increasingly suspicious of Joanne's possible involvement in Bobby's death especially after thought Liam was found and Bobby stern this.
Ernie'S family asked authorities if there was any way to prove whether Joanne was involved to find out the district attorney had curly's body exhumed for a second autopsy.
Forensic toxicologist Dr Fredric rieders was particularly interested in analyzing Bobby curly's hair.
When a substance like that Liam is circulating in the bloodstream it will attach to the hair root which is a cell valium then stays on the hair shaft even as the hair grows out hair grows at the average rate of one point three centimeters per month which means that a strand of hair can contain six months or more of medical history.
Doctor rieders took samples of Bobby curly's hair and cut them into smaller pieces a process called segmental analysis of the hair samples.
Those segments were then analyzed with the test called atomic absorption spectral photometry which shows which sections of here contain Talion and which sections did not.
The results were plotted on the calendar and indicated that Bobby curly was exposed to family M. long before he started work in the chemistry lab.
Sensually two months after they got married about a year before he died.
Rancic tests would soon provide police with even more shocking evidence evidence that pointed in only one direction.
Segmental here analysis indicated Bobby currently had been systematically poisoned with thallium for almost a year long before he started work in the chemistry lab and the tests also indicated Bobby had ingested a massive dose of valium as he lay dying in the hospital.
This horrifying scenario was confirmed when doctor rieders discovered a large concentration of valium in Bobby Hurley's intestines.
Any large dose not too long before he died the concentrations in the intestine where a thousand times higher than the concentrations in this blog and in this autopsy tissues which meant that the veil very recent origin.
Using the timeline of ingestion investigators the lemonade individuals who had no contact with Bobby curly during the times he had been poisoned this was an investigation of exclusion eliminating people that could not have done it until you got down to one person had to.
Which was Joe and police also learned that Joanne and Bobby were not always a happy couple at first I do think Bob was very happy but then even just even a few months into the marriage I wasn't quite sure.
Bob Mason different comments maybe that he was she never got married.
Police discovered shortly after the wedding Bobby made Joanne the sole beneficiary of this life insurance policies worth nearly three hundred thousand dollars.
Forensic tests showed that the poisonings began approximately two months after Bobby and Joanne married.
It'S like she planned right from day one.
When the papers were signed making her beneficiary of everything that's when she started.
Timely members recall Joanne's disturbing behavior at the moment Bobby was taken off life support.
Remember none of us could go into the room and stay there and watch this happen.
She wanted to stay in the room.
C. pap di.
On December twelfth.
Nineteen ninety six joann Curley was arrested and charged with first degree murder.
Facing overwhelming forensic evidence and the possibility of the death penalty she pled guilty to a lesser charge of third degree murder.
Enter sentencing Joanne publicly admitted what forensic testing had already confirmed that she had systematically poisoned her husband with that.
In open court and under oath joann Curley admitted that she personally poisoned her husband over a lengthy period.
She openly admitted to how what was done.
When it was done.
And to the type of poison used.
She placed the stallion in her husband's iced tea about a dozen times her confession matched almost perfectly doctor rieders times.
And that her confession paralleled it I I frankly I was amazed I wasn't proud all the lighting I mean it was good but I was amazed.
Joanne'S confession told a horrific tale of murder motivated by greed.
Her answer when asked point blank why she did this was for the money I killed him for the money.
Joanne said she used rat poison she found in her grandmother's basement.
At first she used only a small amount in her husband's iced tea but later increased the amount when she feared it wasn't working.
She scored a massive amount of valium into his cell and gave it to him as he lay dying.
And the last one that's the one that that really bothered me.
David got it while he was in the hospital because I was there that day and Joanne was there I was sitting next to her purse was right there between us and to know of now that the time was in her purse at that time is really that that bothered me that really bothered.
Joe and may have ingested the valium intentionally and given a small amount to our daughter in order to divert police suspicion.
Joann Curley denies this and says she has no idea how she and her daughter ingested the trace amounts of family.
Ironically Joanne Curley was not aware that that Liam was present in the chemistry lab where Bobby was working before his death.
not knowing what the chemical was that she was poisoning him with and then to have found it at the university where he last worked you couldn't ask for a bigger coincidence we were sitting there showing currently.
But forensic science had established toxicological timeline of the blushing bride.
During the curly was sentenced to ten to twenty years in state prison.
Well she she was somebody who was intent upon carrying out her plan she was intent on on a result and the result that she wanted was was Bob curly's death and he was he was obviously a a a ghoulish type of a crime that you don't see very often anywhere in this country.
I could never forgive children for what she did to Bob.
To watch him die like that.
It was heartbreaking for me to watch him die any human being to die like that no one deserves to die like that.
I know there's evil out there but now I I just it's first time I ever ran into anybody that could the solidly poison somebody and watch them die.
She'S a monster that's what she is I'll always believe that.
In my heart she took somebody away from us that was very dear to us and we miss him terribly I couldn't believe it they got so much from so little.
Well a few strands of hair they're able to tell.
When she gave the poison how often she gave the poison and basically I'm a bigger doses she gave.
Right up to the last day.
