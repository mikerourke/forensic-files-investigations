Surely and ed and drawn out which were regulars in a neighborhood bar a few blocks from their home in Winnipeg Canada.
On one of their nights out and decided to leave early surely wanted to stay there was a brief argument and dad went home alone.
And then surely M. drama which had been married for twenty years and was a construction worker surely was a housewife.
They lived in the fort Rouge section of Winnipeg Canada with their three teenage daughters.
Just as usual they went out for a good time.
Few hours later my dad came home was tired you want to be there anymore she just wanted to stay and his friends are there so she stays as friends.
Surely left the bar around midnight and walked home.
I heard come home that night.
She was by herself I don't know if she was drunk but you could tell that she had been drinking.
And then surely argued again when she came home.
Ed said surely went for a walk to calm down but never returned.
The next morning an employee at a nearby high school discovered a woman's body in the school yard it was very gruesome scene.
There was some very senior homicide detectives that were there that were a little taken aback of of what was discovered there.
They came to the door and I went and got my father.
A lot of stairs.
Then I got called downstairs and.
He just kinda hung his head and.
They told me that you know we found her mother.
And surely a drama which had been sexually assaulted beaten and mutilated with bite wounds over much of her body.
It appeared that she had been strangled then hit with a large piece of concrete it was the destruction often facial features and that was obvious sexual assault had taken place so this this was a a definite gruesome so scene I've been a prosecutor for twenty three years and I have never seen any case.
With as much brutality to human body.
In a written statement and am drawn a which admitted that he argued with his wife that night but said he had no idea what happened to her after she left their home.
Inside investigators Bob Marshall and Ron Oliver decided to question it and run it which again to learn more about what happened on the night surely and drama which was murdered at one point.
He was sort of fast in a in a sort of a helpful sort of a question to him if he had any idea who may have killed his wife.
He said he was the merger he actually had some knowledge of some of the aspects of the crime for example he knew where the body was.
He knew that it was in behind the Grant Park high school there is a very with the with the police I mean.
I thought it was my dad and as there is people who thought it would could even be my father because I knew it wasn't and.
Not only should they just you know not knowing my father know that he could not have done that but trust my word even though I was only fourteen.
So I found to make absolutely sure police questioned and drama which again on the following day and again he confessed.
And then draw on it which was charged with second degree murder.
Add in drama which was held in a Winnipeg jail after confessing to the murder of his wife.
Although parts of his confession were inconsistent with the murder scene and run which said he had been drinking on the night of the murder and his memory wasn't entirely clear.
Police began their forensic investigation by turning to Dick Monroe a forensic geologist with the Winnipeg police department.
The murder weapon was a fifty five pound concrete block found near the body.
Trump was full of Concord particles that was exciting at the outset because he's all those concrete but the trick was can you match the concrete to the block can you put a block and a strong.
The process was tedious since there were hundreds of particles recovered from in front of which is strong all very small because the murder weapon was rough because it was a broken piece of concrete you're looking for like a jigsaw puzzle piece that fit onto it could you get a physical match.
But Monroe wasn't able to find a match.
Next police sent photographs of the victims bite wounds to doctor David sweet a forensic odontology just at the bureau of legal dentistry in Vancouver.
Eight and drama which wore dentures which were also sent for analysis the question that came up obviously was can artificial teeth in the form of a complete upper and lower denture actually quite hard enough to remove human tissue Dr suite performed a metric analysis measuring the width and arch of a drama which is dentures to see if they were similar to the bite wounds on surely and drama which is by.
But Dr suite could find few similarities I think at that point we were all leery of of whether we had the right person or not I know I had a question my own mind as to whether we had the right person.
During surely and drawn a witch's autopsy the medical examiner had swapped the areas around the bite wounds for possible forensic evidence.
The swabs were rolled in a moist and filter paper and the paper turned white.
Positive presumptive test for the presence of saliva.
The next step was to determine the blood type of the saliva.
We had a new technique at our disposal called Eliza.
Which allowed us to.
But typing factors the elisa test revealed that the perpetrator had type B. blood this did not match the drama which is blood type.
Therefore Mr Dr H. being of blood type a could not have left the B. type saliva found on swabs from the breast.
Thereby meaning he did not he could not have been.
In my mind to murder.
After two months in prison for a murder he confessed to but apparently didn't commit and drama which was released.
Why had he confessed.
And one which back at that time had a terrible problem with alcohol.
And when the detectives interviewed and they asked him such questions as did you have a fight with your wife last night.
He responded and said well I might have and then when they went on in Preston said well did you hear he said I might have.
Memory lapses while drinking or call blackouts and happened because alcohol interferes with the neurotransmitters shins that form memory in the brain.
And when they come out of the black out it's the realization that recollection all of a sudden that something bad may well have happened and it's very common for alcoholics to feel remorse express guilt even imagine that they have done a terrible thing said during the blackout period.
Now the police investigation had to start all over again.
The murder weapon was a fifty five pound piece of concrete the forensic geologist Richard been road appeared to be about five years old and looked as if it had once been part of the bumper block used in parking lots.
Maduro decided to visit the murder scene to survey the area.
He went around midnight to evaluate the scene the way it appeared at the time of the merger.
Standing where the body was discovered mineral wondered what exactly took place.
If the victim had been strangled and was unconscious what happened next.
Where did the concrete block come from.
Then then rose salt and a limited area about five hundred feet away.
N. roll found piece of concrete.
About twelve feet away was another piece both were similar to the murder weapon.
The killer had been drawn to the area by light.
It'S only visual cue.
To prove his theory and only to find out whether the murder weapon and the pieces in the school yard had once been part of the same block.
One group performed a petrographic examination petrography is the term for identification of minerals.
Concrete is made of sand cement water and pieces of stone which is poured into molds to form the bumper blocks.
As it dries the mix designs settles into a distinctive pattern which is visually different in each concrete block.
Women wrote compared the murder weapon to the other concrete pieces found in the school yard the mix design and position of the stones were identical.
The city was almost like a glove when you get a broken aggregates in near your center gravel inside your concrete it'll break in choosing a regular surface and you'll have some call class small stones that will break out of the concrete mold and you but you try to do is fit that in and it's not just one fit it's a collection of fits Monroe suspected that the murder weapon might contain fingerprints.
But lifting the print from a porous surface like concrete is extremely difficult.
This almost like a fingerprint is sitting on top of that and nails so you're late material which is very very thin sitting on top of something that is very very tenuous as a last resort Monroe decided to try a technique usually used to find prints on non porous surfaces called super glue fumes.
A drop of superglue is placed into a chamber along with the item containing the print and the chamber is heated for up to six hours.
By heating the super glue fumes contents and that here to biological materials such as the oils of the fingerprint.
Under a laser light the biological material the rest is producing a clear image of the print.
One row followed the steps with the concrete placing both the super glue and the concrete in a vacuum chamber.
The color of the concrete is the same as a cyanoacrylate.
In order to see a print mineral needed to find a chemical that would attach itself to the cyanoacrylate.
After a number of tries when Rowe finally found one that worked it was a biological scheme known as Sudan black.
Monroe found what he was looking for.
But it was badly smudged.
Unfortunately with the circumstances of the event with the end of it being used as a pile driver and repeated blows on the on the victim hi there was a certain amount of slippage taking place with a fifty five pound block on the on my hands.
But the discovery of the related concrete pieces in the school yard was important it revealed that it was a crime of opportunity and that the perpetrator may have been on foot.
But a full year past.
One year after the crime local television stations and newspapers carried stories about the unsolved murder hoping to jog someone's memory or conscience.
The media campaign led to the break police were hoping for.
One year after the brutal murder of Shirley and drama which.
An informant came forward saying that his roommate had returned home on the night of the murder with stains on his jeans and boots that looked like blood.
We lived in an apartment building across the street from the murder scene.
Mark Johnson was a twenty nine year old unemployed construction worker the informant also revealed the Germans had burned his clothes the day after the merger.
Samples of Germans blood and saliva was sent to the forensic lab.
Tests revealed that mark German had type B. blood the same blood type as the saliva found on the victim.
Photographs and impressions of Germans teeth were also sent for analysis John had a distinctive pattern that is ground the biting edge of the upper and lower teeth into a flat surface there were also some unusual spaces between the teeth and several areas had not been restored as a result of some of the testing that I did and the comparison with the suspect's teeth I was able to determine that his teeth were in fact consistent with causing these marks or another way to explain that is his teeth could not be excluded in this case as causing those marks.
Finally police had a shopping list they found in the school yard on the night of the murder it was a big school yard and police weren't sure whether the shopping list had any connection to the murder.
On the shopping list was a fingerprint.
That print belonged to mark John my placing him in the school yard around the time of the merger.
After initially denying he was involved mark Drummond eventually confessed.
German said he was at the same bar surely and and and drawn a witch on the night of the murder but he didn't speak to the.
He said he ran into surely and Rhonda which later and near the high school while she was out walking.
Unless you work for Jarman said they talked and had consensual sex.
German said he emptied the contents of her purse to make the scene appeared to be a robbery.
But investigators didn't believe Germans entire story.
Staff sergeant Dan wrong is a blood spatter expert who studied the crime scene photos and noticed an inconsistency in German story.
The distance blood travels from a head wound struck by an object the size and weight of a cement block is ten to twelve weeks.
Creating medium velocity impact spatter.
On the papers found within ten to twelve feet of Shirley and drawn a witch's body Ron discovered medium velocity impact spatter.
The pictures of the evidence actually showed that the contents of her purse had been strewn around at some location in a position where they were exposed to the bloodletting which meant the trillion drawn a witch's purpose was ran sacked before she was murdered not afterwards.
Mark Johnson was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for twenty five years.
He took my mother.
I was fourteen years old.
It'S almost half my life.
I don't know how I'm ever supposed to forgive somebody doing a terrible thing.
There is no punishment severe enough.
That we can give this guy for taking something that.
Not a day goes by when she doesn't come into my mind.
I just think about what it would have been like if she was still here.
I miss her.
