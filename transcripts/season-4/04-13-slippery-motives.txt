While on a business trip in nineteen eighty six.
Spent the morning jogging near his hotel in downtown Saint Louis.
When he returned to his hotel room.
The medical examiner ruled the death was by drowning.
Similarly accidentals but homicide investigators weren't so sure.
Post met Julie big band when they were both students at the university of southern Mississippi in the nineteen sixties.
They married in nineteen sixty seven had two daughters.
I went to work in the real estate business.
His outgoing personality and sophisticated manner made him a successful salesman right from the start I thought that was a good fellow what you'd expect a real estate salesman to be kind of relentlessly cheerful after a few years at post became part owner of the Wagner Truax real estate firm.
Julie post also joined the company and was very successful selling over a million dollars of real estate every year from nineteen eighty two on.
In June of nineteen eighty six the post's attended a realistic convention in Saint Louis Missouri at the omni hotel at Union Station.
On the morning of June third at post decided to go jogging before the meeting started he said he drew his wife of bath and will Kerr before leaving around seven AM.
On his way out he thanked the hotel's concierge for a suggestion she made to the post the day before really wonderful so glad the wonderful place this anything else I can do for you just let me know.
Around the city's famous arch and return to the hotel at seven forty.
When he entered his hotel room he said he discovered his wife lying face down and unconscious in the back.
After pulling her body from the water he call for an ambulance at seven forty three percent of families place.
It looked as if Julie post lost her footing and grab the towel ring which pulled out of the wall.
At the hospital Julie post was pronounced dead she was thirty nine years old.
The autopsy revealed that death was due to drowning.
Ed post immediately phoned his brother who was a lawyer together they photographed the broken tiles rang in mount for a lawsuit against a hotel his brother told police when there's a Lowe's almost sold for four hundred fifty million dollars you watch.
And post was convinced that had it not been for the faulty powering his wife Julie might still be alive.
After Julie post was pronounced dead an autopsy was performed in St Louis before the body was transported to New Orleans for Barry.
The autopsy found no sign of alcohol or drugs in her system.
There were no skull fractures or bleeding in the brain that would have been present at the victim had been struck in the head before drowning in short the path colleges could find no evidence of foul play I was certainly not convinced that it was an accident.
On the other hand I couldn't prove that it was anything else.
On the death certificate the manner of death was undetermined.
When the St Louis post dispatch reported the news of Julie posted that there were some interesting reactions.
D. Joyce Hayes was a prosecutor in the district attorney's office her husband Gary was a detective in the St Louis police department.
D. had just read an article about a woman who was who had drowned in the bathtub at the omni hotel and she said Gerry make sure you read this it doesn't sound right to me we both read the article and look at each other and said Nash.
The hotel management found it hard to believe that a one hundred twenty pound woman like Julie post could have pulled the towel ring from the war since the ring had been designed to withstand more than twice that weight we went to the two adjoining rooms.
I probably weighed close to two hundred twenty pounds at the time.
With all my weight Honda both tolerance and both rooms and neither one of them gave nothing.
Post told police that he and his wife had a very good relationship but a background check of the posts finances revealed an interesting coincidence we went to the insurance company.
And how long the whole.
hello twenty seven twenty nine days prior to Julie post death.
It had it increased your insurance like for five hundred thousand dollars now this is a woman who's making in the low to mid twenty thousand dollar a year range in salary and he's got this six seven hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy on his wife in a.
Begin to believe maybe we have something here police also discovered that post was enamored with a married woman who worked in his office her name was Kim ten.
On the day of Julie posts funeral it made an unusual request came out.
Kim ten had a twin sister and at the time of the funeral of Julie it post said the camo tan maybe when this is over you can set me up with your sister and that seemed a most inappropriate thing to be saying and particularly saying at the time that he's alleged to have said it.
These were also suspicious about the way at post told the story of finding his wife's body the story never varied almost as if it had been rehearsed St Louis police tape recorded those conversations and grandma came over the edges.
Oct came off is a.
Is a non caring person that.
Had this alibi who had everything down Pat I mean he didn't change his story one iota from the first time he told to the second time he told it and some of the hotel employees noticed that post was acting suspiciously on the morning of the accident.
Before leaving the hotel for his morning run and post made sure that the concierge knew who he was thanking her for a favor she did for him the day before I believe you're the one that tells about the tentacle gardens mom wife finally had a chance to visit there yesterday spectacular really wonderful I'm so glad and the hotel doorman said the post introduced himself by name before going out to restaurants.
Yes I am thank you my name is a post on a run this morning I'll be gone in about thirty minutes watch out for a nice run he made it a point to say good morning to the the woman at the hotel say who he was and what room he was in and that he was going to go out and job I mean like it was from the book of who cares at the dorm I didn't care.
Why would you do that.
But all of these incidents simply raise suspicions homicide investigators had no hard evidence that and post played any role in his wife's death.
Investigators decided to conduct more sophisticated tests on the broken.
To see if a woman Julie post size could have pulled it from the wall during the fourth.
Prosecutors in St Louis we're starting to wonder whether the death of Julie post in the hotel back.
Was truly an accident.
The autopsy did not find any evidence of foul play so prosecutors decided to aids you delete posts remains for a second autopsy.
She had been buried in the cemetery outside of New Orleans the water table is so high in New Orleans but most people are buried in above ground faults but Julie post had been buried in the ground and her body was placed in a wooden casket investigators feared that water damage to the body would be significant when they opened the grave it was almost completely filled with water fortunately the foot of the casket was the part that sunk her head was the only part of a body that was not submerged in water in our head.
Was in perfect shape the casket had collapsed and push down added pressed flattened her nose from the pressure but that was the only just figuration from the collapsing of the casket most of the casket collapse had been at the foot down the path ology is to perform the second autopsy found numerous bruises that were not noted during the first autopsy that's not unusual because some bruising continues to develop even after death add posts attorney said that the additional Bruce's proven nothing that they could have been caused by the removing of her organs and bones for donation shortly after her death.
But the path all they just found two new Bruce is in a critical area the only additional findings at the autopsy.
Was an area bruising that was very low that far down the back of the head in the upper neck region wear it in a normal on top so usually don't take the scalp down quite that far but I'm looking at these bruises and as far as I'm concerned it's from a song and a hand.
You'Re holding somebody under water.
Next prosecutors turned their attention to the metal Howell Raines found inside the top next to Julie posts body.
The ring and wall mounted been designed and manufactured to withstand hundreds of pounds of force.
Prosecutors hired boulder Kelsey and accident reconstruction is to attempt to recreate the accident.
Kelsey conducted his experiments at the hotel on.
In a room with an identical powering attached to the wall in the same way as the towel ring in and then Julie posed a room and for the test Kelsey used a woman who was the same height and weight as Julie post Kelsey asked the model to simulate a fall by grabbing on to the towel ring with all of her way.
Then she was asked to wrench the ring back and forth again nothing happened.
What we found was that doing some calculations are based on what information we had on the ultimate strength of the ring that we could not remove it by a person can remove it at that site unless she fell about sixty four feet and grabbed the towering as she went by and of course the hotel room is an eight foot ceiling so there's no way that that could happen.
Finally as a last resort Kelsey asked the model to use both hands to remove the towel ring in any way she caught.
After considerable effort the rain came off.
Concept the Julie post somehow ram this towering during the fall.
And pulled it off the wall was impossible it could not physically have happened that way.
Next prosecutors sent an identical powering and wall mount the doctor William winds a professor of mechanical engineering at the university of Nebraska in Lincoln.
Dr wines was asked to determine how much force was required to remove the towel ring from the wall attachment those test revealed that it took between four hundred eighty and five hundred pounds of force to remove it from the wall.
It was also obvious very early on the testing that those types of moments of force application straight polls poles down clearly didn't match the evidence that the deformed hollering the fail tolerate didn't look anything like the tolerant in question here the base plate had damage underneath the spam and on the left side the towel ring itself also had been damaged.
Dr winds perform twenty three different tests to reproduce the damage found on the base plate and powering all without success.
But on the test number twenty four Dr wines produced something very close that test indicated that the towel ring was removed from outside the back top.
Our conclusion was that it was taken off the wall by someone with considerable strength and it was you know the type of action where one would grab it and pull outside the tub and it was.
in the if you look at the location of it it would be consistent for instance was someone like putting your foot on the edge of the tub and grabbing a towering and then pulling it off out out toward the outside of the tub prosecutors now had scientific proof that you only post death was no accident.
In nineteen eighty six New Orleans was going through its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression many local businesses were affected and real estate was just one more casualty.
And post was ten percent owner of the Wagner Truax real estate business and was responsible for ten percent of the losses which in nineteen eighty five and eighty six were substantial and the post's marriage was going through a down turn of its own friend said that individually for frequently fights which were sometimes physical and chemical tanks who worked with the post said posted made advances towards her in the months before Julie's back.
He had to be a free man with lots of money.
To compete with her husband.
Prosecutors believe that plan was in motion one month before Julie's death when ed post increased his wife's life insurance.
On June third nineteen eighty six before going out for his morning run prosecutors believe that close drowned his wife in the hotel bath top.
The towel ring from the wall not only to corroborate his cover story the Julie fell while holding on to the towering but also for the money the potential settlement from the hotel in a civil lawsuit.
After the market post made sure to speak with both the hotel concierge and doorman to cementing his alibi thank you my name is ed.
The whole business with the towering which is really what killed him not literally but figuratively.
You know he had to go pull that off the wall.
He had to go pull that off the wall so that he could set up a lawsuit against the omni hotel and get more money.
The greedy SOB.
Three years after Julie post death and post went on trial for first degree murder.
A post pleaded not guilty and took the stand in his own defense it's demeanor on the stand I think could best be described.
He was very well dressed he was very articulate spoke at a very a sophisticated level including his use of the language spoke I think of far differently than the jurors were accustomed to speaking or hearing he did not speak with a southern accent at all although he was from New Orleans.
And he came across as it as it often came across as condescending.
And I think that those things did not play well in the scientific experts provided powerful testimony that Julie post was not capable of removing the powering during the fall.
It took the jury less than a day to reach its verdict.
A post was found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Add post and his attorneys appealed the conviction and in a plea bargain posted breed to plead guilty to second degree murder and confessed to the murder of his wife in exchange for a thirty year prison sentence that included the possibility of parole if he doesn't take.
What happened almost everybody classified it as undetermined or accident.
But for that.
At seven thousand nine.
In my opinion.
The most important thing.
in the trial.
You can show that it was rich back and forth back and forth until it came loose.
