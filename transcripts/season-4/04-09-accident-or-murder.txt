What are you going to do on the morning of February twentieth nineteen eighty nine something terrible happened to Janice Johnson a thirty five year old housewife and mother of two children.
I got a call talk to you later.
The investigation into that morning's events would raise questions that process to this day.
Clayton and Janice Johnson lived in the tiny coastal fishing village of Shelburne Nova Scotia.
It'S a close knit community where townspeople all know one another.
For the Johnsons Shelburne was the ideal place to raise their two young daughters eleven year old Darla and nine year old on the two of the girls trip star this winter we were always together like even ask anybody running in one of the scenes were forty years ago it's got some very very rarely ever when they were in division.
Clayton was an industrial arts teacher at the local high school Janice was a homemaker the Johnsons were deeply religious family and very active in their church volunteering much of their free time to church activities they are always facing people and doing this and then my mom was the type of person that she didn't like to just sit around and do nothing so we were always busy doing something.
And like we never went anywhere without doing an S. family.
The morning of February twentieth nineteen eighty nine was a typical one for the Johnson family.
After the children left for school Platon carried some laundry to the basement for his wife.
Moments later the telephone rang Satan answered on the basement extensions or that's right.
It is clear tops our next door neighbor.
But then left for work stopping along the way at the local gas station.
A few minutes later the neighbors stopped by the Johnsons home.
He discovered genesis at the bottom of the stairs she was bloody and unconscious but still alive.
Clayton heard the news but he arrived at work and rushed to the hospital.
Janice had sustained severe head injuries from what was assumed to be an accidental fall down the basement steps.
Despite the best of medical treatment Janice died of a head wound several hours later she was just thirty five years old.
I think it was the first time I've ever seen my father cry.
My first reaction was that it wasn't it wasn't real I can.
If you want to believe it didn't happen.
The small community of Shelburne rallied around Johnson and his two daughters as they paid their last respects to a loving wife and mother.
But that support soon Trumbull when Clayton Johnson started dating a woman thirty years his junior.
After Janice Johnson's death the chief medical examiner Dr Roland Perry performed an autopsy.
He was hampered to some extent by the fact that there were no photographs of the accident scene.
In a misguided effort to be helpful to family friends had washed the blood from the basement before photographs could be taken.
This is a police video shop later as the women describe the blood stains.
They said there was a small blood stain on the floor at the bottom of the steps and the blood stained with blood the hair on the concrete wall next to the third step.
This recreation shows the position of Janice Johnson's body when paramedics arrived.
Her head was on the floor her leg was above her head on the step.
In her left hand she was holding her car keys.
Although Dr Perry found Janice Johnson's wounds to be unusual he ruled the death a freak accident concluding that she had fallen down the steps to her death.
He suspected that her skull had become wedged in a five and a half inch space between the wooden steps and the adjoining concrete wall which crushed both sides of her head.
When she landed on the concrete floor she sustained a wound to the top of her head.
Since Janice Johnson was thought to be in the house alone at the time of the incident foul play was ruled out.
Janice was on the telephone with player Thompson who said she heard Clayton case Janice goodbye before leaving for work.
Well you better look for.
Claire Thompson said they talked for ten minutes and that the call ended around seven fifty.
Witnesses saw Clayton Johnson at the gas station at the same time.
A minute or two later a neighbor found Janice in the basement and called paramedics the call was logged in at seven fifty two.
That was so to speak the end of that of course Clayton and his daughters had to deal with the the great losses they have suffered it was only off to some eighteen months have passed that Clayton really made what might be called a dreadful mistake.
Clayton Johnson's mistake was to fall in love soon after genesis Dan Clayton started dating and later married twenty two year old Tino way print.
She was a member of the Johnson's church and was thirty years his junior.
In the close knit conservative community of Shelburne this new relationship raised a few eyebrows police also discovered that Clayton Johnson had purchased a one hundred twenty thousand dollar life insurance policy on Janice two months before she died.
A background check revealed that Clayton Johnson was also having financial difficulties and that utility services were sometimes cut off in their home for non payment and pretty soon fact became confused the rumor rumor was fact and the more people talked the more people wondered whether this lovable teddy bear Clayton Johnson was a white color.
So police decided to re opened their investigation into Janice Johnson's death.
Homicide investigators went back to re interview the woman who cleaned up the blood after Janice Johnson's death.
To their surprise two years later one of the women recalled seeing more blood in the basement then she originally reported.
Across the length of the floor and on piles of lumber along the far wall.
Investigators took this new information along with the autopsy photos the two of Canada's most respected pathologist.
Three years after his wife's death Clayton Johnson was arrested and charged with first degree murder.
Johnson pleaded not guilty to the charge.
Prosecutors introduced a new blood spatter testimony and also raised the issue of Johnson's new love interest Clayton Johnson was on trial for events that happened after the accident he was on trial for the insurance money that is collected he was on trial for this it new girlfriend that he that he that he had left move in with them Clayton Johnson was found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.
Have you ever felt like.
You were reading a book.
That'S what it seemed like it didn't seem like it was.
It could be happening in my life.
Johnson was ordered to serve his sentence in the Atlantic maximum security institution.
From there he contacted the association in defense of the wrongfully convicted in Toronto.
His story caught the attention of the director of the organization James Lockyer as you go back through the miscarriages of justice in both our countries in the town of that is in the United States and in England.
I will be as awesome as forty to fifty percent of the time a bad science has played a significant role in a wrongful conviction.
But the first thing you're noticed wasn't just questionable science it was a problem with the time line.
Claire Thompson said she was on the telephone with Janice Johnson on the morning of her death.
In her original statement Thompson said she heard Janice goodbye at approximately seven forty.
Sure she said the call with Janice lasted ten minutes until about seven fifty.
A witness said Clayton Johnson was at the gas station at the same time seven fifty one clear Thompson said she was sending her call to Janice.
Nine one one the neighbor found genesis body and called paramedics at seven fifty two.
Clayton was aware the Janis was expecting company that morning any series that he would kill his wife in a time span of seconds all minutes when he could legitimately expect three different people to show up at the house in that very time that he was supposedly assaulting his wife you put all that together the theory echoed his wife was in my view a completely ridiculous.
What spatter expert herb macdonell was also skeptical he believes that the witnesses original statements were probably the most accurate the neighbors at that time reported that the blood was consistent with an accident now obviously they're not qualified to interpret a bloodstain patterns but had they seen a lot of spattering or if they'd seen blood upon the walls and ceiling I think at that time even though they were cleaning it up they would have a clear recollection of what it looked like an especially where they washed it up.
Another story that changed was clear Thompson in her original statement she said she called Janice around seven forty and that the call lasted for ten minutes.
Two years later she said she may have called it closer to seven thirty.
This created the window of opportunity for Johnson to have murdered his wife.
James lock your ass to forensic pathologist to review the forensic evidence independent.
Dr Linda north Dallas Texas and Dr James Ferris to Vancouver.
They both examined the case file and autopsy photos.
And it was what they didn't see.
That they found most intriguing.
There are no defense wounds and INEC bludgeoning of this nature considering the location of the head wounds one would expect to see defensive wounds if this were an actual bludgeoning death.
During an attack.
Most individuals instinctively raised their hands to protect themselves as a result their hands and forearms sustained injuries there's absolutely no evidence that any of the injuries were as a result of some form of homicide and assault.
Janice Johnson's car keys were in her hand when paramedics arrived.
The lack of farm loans and the car keys also cast doubt on the original forensic report which stated the Janice fell forwards down the steps what occurred is that she slipped top of the stairs and she fell backwards instead of forwards and of course most falls down the stairs are forward falls backward falls are uncommon and I think that's what led to an awful lot of the misinterpretation that occurred in this case.
Clayton Johnson's new defense team now had two major hurdles first to prove to the court that Johnson was innocent and also to show how Janice Johnson really dont.
By the time Clayton Johnson's new defense team gathered their information he had spent six years behind bars.
It was a life Johnson had no choice but to get used to a whole new ballgame versus your change in life style the whole thing you know it's.
It'S a rude awakening Johnson's team of forensic experts did not believe that his wife's injuries were consistent with the bludgeoning death.
And they did not think she had fallen for words as was originally reported they believe that Janice had fallen backwards to get Johnson's conviction overturned his lawyers needed to find a way to show how the accident really happened.
They turned to blood spatter expert Herbert macdonell but after studying the case file McDonald couldn't figure out a way to recreate an accidental fall down the basement steps.
The very night that I was about ready to call James Lockyer and advise him that I just I could not do my recreation and I've done many of these reconstructions or re creations if you like I was very disappointed and I told him I was about to tell them that I I just couldn't do it and that night I read the morning paper I frequently don't read the paper until a day late and on the front page here's Peter Pan at west high school and of course I thought Hey.
Well give me way up suddenly.
In the production of the musical Peter Pan various characters fly across the stage in a harness.
Donald called the high school borrowed the transom and the operator and hired a model the same height and weight as Janice Johnson.
But Donald then built a replica of the Johnsons basement steps he videotaped the entire procedure and put blue chalk on the wall and step where witnesses saw the blood.
With the model at the top of the steps she fell backwards.
When her head fell into the gap in between the third staff and the concrete wall.
The chalk marks on the model's head were consistent with the injuries found on Janice Johnson.
There'S no question that that is a good explanation for how the wounds on Jenna Johnson occurred over her right here it's remarkable when you see it because the blue marks appear on the model's head exactly where the injuries are found on genesis left and right temples.
James Lockyer believes the Janice Johnson was still on the telephone when Clayton was at the gas station.
And the call ended at seven fifty just as our neighbor was arriving at the house you know I've got to go.
She grabbed the car keys ran up the steps and Gloucester forty.
And she fell backwards her head became wedged in the five and a half inch gap between the staff and the cement wall.
Her feet older head from the gap flipping her body over on to the basement floor producing the gash found on the top of her head.
When all of this information came to light Canadian prosecutors took the unusual step of releasing Clayton Johnson from prison.
He had spent six years behind bars.
You just have to get back from the family.
Yes I'm very pleased with the decision of justice Freeman.
And I couldn't ask for better legal team one of god.
And I just wanna get back my family currently have right now because that means my dad's actually gonna see me graduate.
I'Ve got my father back in my life.
Although authorities have made no final decisions about the case and there's always the chance of a re trial.
Many believe it will simply be dismissed.
For a crime forensic experts say didn't happen.
Six years in prison is on the.
We'Ve made an error so once you recognize you've made an error you do the best you can to rectify it the best way to rectify this case is simply too with this man exonerate him and let him go on with his life was given all different opinions version of justice system's concerned.
Because I mean I've always been brought up right from the time most walk around the place for your friend to call them on a certain level and the distracted all through this makes you think twice.
