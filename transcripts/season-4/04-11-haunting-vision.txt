On September seventeenth nineteen sixty six Diane chi del meta boyfriend for a drink at a local night spot.
After leaving the bar she disappeared.
Officials weren't sure whether she ran away from the responsibilities facing a single mother with four young children or perhaps had been the victim of foul play.
That question was answered twenty seven years later when her daughter came forward with the fantastic tale of something she saw when she was five years old.
In nineteen fifty six twenty one year old Diane Kidder went to work in her father's grocery store in Peoria Illinois she needed the money said she was recently divorced and was raising her two year old daughter Susie and it was in that store one day where she met a bachelor from town gene chi down.
Gene was in the best looking guy in the world but he's a good talker he's a very good talk and he was able to woo her the couple dated for a year fell in love and eventually married.
They moved to Phoenix Arizona where gene found work in the growing construction industry.
Together gene and Diane had three more children ray Kelly and Laura.
It'S in smaller great childhood memories over time Diane and gene decided that it was best for all concerned if they divorced.
On September seventeenth the couple met for dinner at a nearby restaurant to discuss the final details of the property settlement and visitation.
By all accounts the meeting went well after which Diane dropped gene off at his apartment from there Diane drove to the amber in where she met Bob Marley a man she'd been casually dating since her separation.
A few hours later Jean chi dell call Diane at the house and when the children said she still wasn't home he went over to babysit and fell asleep on the sofa.
The next morning Jean said he found his wife's car in the driveway but there was no sign of her Jean called the police department and reported her missing until she arrived home her car was there the person was in the house her keys were in the homes on the table in the kitchen Diane did not taking calls whether that we learned up and there was no reason for her to run away there was no no motive there.
Missing persons investigators couldn't understand why Diane would have left town without her children.
Her neighbors her mother and her brother all indicated they would never leave her children for any length of time they described her as an excellent mother very concerned about her children.
When police went to interview Bob Marland the man Diane was with at the bar they were told an incredible piece of news.
Bob Marland suffered a heart attack and died the day after his date with Diane.
Whatever marlin might have known about Diane's disappearance went with him to his great.
Two days after Diane chi dell's mysterious disappearance Jeanne Keitel moved back into the family home to look after the four children.
My father's explanation to not only his children but to neighbor sent anybody that that would inquire about my mother's sudden disappearance was that my mother had run off with with a boyfriend.
Jeanne provided police with a list of man he said Diane had been dating since the separation but they all were dead ends.
Over time the chi delta children adjusted to life without their mother although they all hope that some day she would return.
Four months later tragedy struck once again around nine o'clock at night while Jean was at a nearby laundromat.
A fire broke out in the chi Dale's home.
The blaze quickly engulfed the entire house and the four children were trapped in their bedroom.
Susie the oldest let the others around the flames.
Laurie ran back into a bedroom for her Winnie the Pooh stuffed animal.
I was crying I wanted my mother and my older sisters.
She said I love you.
Lucy gave her life protecting Laurie from the flames of the lorry suffered third degree burns over fifty percent of her body.
Continually locked from my sister as she helped me and died protecting me but the trauma.
The nightmares the horror of it that doesn't go away.
I just try to overcome that with knowing that I was laughed but I was valuable enough.
To die for.
What can you say I mean when you see that it takes your breath away I mean you you realize that that person made the ultimate sacrifice.
Eight year old Kelly also died in the fire nine year old drag survive.
Investigators found a melted pot on the stove top burner the knob was in the on position as a result the fire was ruled accidental.
After spending four months in the hospital burn unit Lori went back to live in the family home her father had to rebuild after the fire.
One year later there was an incident that help Lori realized the terrible truth of what happened to her mother.
It happened when Lori and her father went to a friend's funeral his name was Michael a boy from the neighborhood who was killed in the Vietnam War.
They'Re in a very.
And I began to cry and I threw.
Trying to make people understand that we needed to wait Michael that I wasn't going to permit them to bury Michael on the ground I was the only.
Living person that now knew the secret of my mother.
But it took another twenty seven years for Lori to reveal the deep dark family secrets she had.
In nineteen ninety three after Diane chi del had been missing for twenty seven years her only surviving daughter Lori walked into the Phoenix police department with a written statement described a terrible secret she had been too afraid to reveal to whom it may concern I need to convey to authorities what I witnessed as a child first time us greatly impress the fear I have of my father's violent retaliation I was often told when I was a child by my father I brought you into this world I can take you out.
The letter went on to say that as a five year old child.
Lori saw her father her mother to death.
At first Lori thought her mother was sleeping as hibernating animals do she said she once asked her father if she could dig a hole in the back yard to feed her mother.
As a five year old I thought my mother was sleeping I thought that my father made my mother go to sleep.
And I thought he buried my sleeping mother in the hole in the backyard I wasn't confused on where she was I wasn't confused on who did it I was confused between sleeping and death.
Only after she friends funeral she realizes that would never.
Detected and Reynolds at first I wasn't sure what to think I've been lied to by some pretty good wires and events fooled by a lot of people and when that happens you tell yourself I'm not gonna let that happen again I'm not gonna fall hook line and sinker for every story that comes down the pike in in this case though she did seem very believable very truthful very sincere in what she said but I still.
I wanted more than just story I wanted proof.
Lori said that her father poured concrete patio over her mother's grave the day after he buried her.
The home had long since been sold by her father who was now remarried and living across town.
Reynolds was hesitant to ask the new owners for permission to dig up their concrete patio without more evidence than a twenty seven year recollection.
I became very frustrated.
I became angry.
I thought that possibly the officials didn't believe me.
I was terrified that my father would find out that I had confessed Reynolds looked all over the country for the technology that could look underneath the concrete patio without damaging it.
Search took almost a year and led to a nonprofit agency in Colorado called Necro search which brings applied sciences to law enforcement.
In this case Necro search recommended a ground penetrating radar system.
The proof substantiation is going to have to be careful excavation.
When the radar was pulled across the cement decade it revealed ground disturbance six feet long by two feet wide in the corner of the patio.
The very spot on the concrete where Lori Romanek had taken me to earlier when we had walked through the backyards where she suspected.
The body of her mother was buried.
When police removed the concrete.
They had to dig only ten inches before making the grisly discovery.
Within hours they uncovered the rest of the remains in the shallow two foot gray they also discovered abroad and the girl.
Laurie Romanek was not at all surprised now I I don't need any medical detectives to prove to me that that's my mother.
There was no identification on the remains and bacteria in the shallow grave eliminated the possibility of DNA testing.
Even the teeth were too badly damaged by bacteria to analyze the.
Usually a rich protected source of DNA so detectives had to use other means to identify the skills.
The first clue was a treat from a neighbor's mulberry tree that had grown from the sky.
The route was sent to doctor Thomas Honnold Adentro chronology is that the university of Arizona.
By studying the age of the tree root and the manner in which it penetrated the skull Portland was convinced that the body was placed in the ground before the trees.
Since the roof was fifteen years old the body was placed in the grave before nineteen seventy eight.
This will tell us the age of the tree root growing over the body means that the body had to be there before the treatment was there.
Otherwise it would have been cut to disturb it would not have gone across this gives a minimum age for the body to be in that position forensic anthropologist Dr Laura full genetic analyzed the skeletal remains and determined it was a Caucasian woman between five foot four and five foot five inches in height.
The pelvic bones indicated that the woman had given birth to at least two children and was between twenty and forty years of age all were consistent with Diane cut down.
Dental X. rays are commonly used for identification unfortunately Diane Keitel's dentist was no longer in practice and dental X. rays had been destroyed as a last ditch effort to identify the remains Dr full genetic decided to try a technique called skull photographs superimposition play basically are doing is taking a picture of the person in life and superimposing it onto this call the person that you think it might have been.
Dr folgen Eddie photographed the skull in the same position and size as the photograph of Diane Keitel taken shortly before she disappeared a canine tooth that was slightly ajar it's it's just stuck out slightly from her mouth we were able to line that up with the two in the photograph I have no questions I'm sure that it's our.
Police immediately arrested sixty one year old gene chi dal and charged him with murder.
Laurie Romanek was now ready to tell a judge and jury what really happened on the night her mother disappeared.
Four years gene Keitel told family and friends and his wife Diane abandoned her children and ran off with the boyfriend.
Laurie Romanek told a very different story about what happened to a mother on the night of September seventeenth nineteen sixty six.
I'M sorry said the mother was wearing her blue double breasted dress when she left to meet her father for dinner at a local restaurant.
After dinner Diane drove Jean home to his apartment later witnesses saw Diane at the amber in having drinks with the boyfriend.
Around eleven PM gene called the house to speak with Diane and when he learned that she wasn't there went over to the house to wait for when Diane returned home around midnight the couple fought waking five year old glory and our oldest sister Susie.
The two girls went to investigate.
Right now I only.
When she saw her children she said.
And it was at that point that my father delivered.
And had had and selecting for.
When the children eventually came out of hiding they saw their mother is lifeless body on the pool and they solved their father hole in the back yard.
The next day Jean Keitel poured a fresh layer of concrete over is a white screen for what he thought would be an eternity.
Laurie describes her father as an alcoholic cruel and violent we're talking about the fact that my father would beat my mother.
My father would attempt to beat his children my siblings and I am when my mother was alive she would intervene and she would not permit my father to beat his children.
She was very strong on that issue.
Laurie also says that her father threatened to kill her if she ever revealed details of her mother's death.
This was something that Lori says that she never forgot.
And she would just been terrified for her whole childhood and then adult life of her of her father even after she got married and left the house and they barely had a relationship at some points it was she remembered the thing the whole way through and somehow I mean I don't think there's anyone that really can.
Exactly describe what was going on the headers all those years.
In nineteen ninety five.
Hi Dale was convicted for the murder of his wife Diane.
And was sentenced to life in prison.
I think it says that the memory of a five year old even though it's some twenty nine years later is sufficient to convict but again remember the one unanswerable question was if what she saw was and what she saw how could she have led us to the body and she did.
My father single handedly murdered my mother.
Order on me and a murder on my brother.
I think that my father well.
More is calling upon staff.
I I pray for my father I think that this judicial system will have nothing.
In the comparison of the wrath of god.
And that I'm sorry for.
My father will have to answer to be held accountable.
What does a man.
Our creator god.
When god says what did you do to that.
What will be my father's pension.
