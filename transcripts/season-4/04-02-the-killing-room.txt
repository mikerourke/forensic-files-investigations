When Scott Dunn arrived at his friend's party he brought along a new acquaintance someone his friends had never met before.
Scott was a ladies man and while it wasn't unusual for him to be seeing a number of women at the same time his date on this night raised more than a few.
Sometime during the party Scott became ill so sick he was unable to drive home.
A few days later Scott Dunn disappeared and was never seen again.
Twenty four year old Scott don was a fun loving young man who enjoyed life to the fullest.
Scott lived in Lubbock Texas settling there after serving in the U. S. military.
He worked for MGM electronics in a job he loved installing custom sound systems in automobiles.
The last time friend saw Scott was on may thirteenth nineteen ninety one at a party after work.
Scott was a prankster and decided to add a little excitement to the festivities.
His date that night wasn't a she at all she was really a he a transvestite.
For the night was through Scott's friends eventually found out and warned the muse.
Later while still at the party Scott became ill he was so sick he couldn't drive home and stayed overnight on the sofa.
The next day his live in girlfriend Lisa Hamilton drove over to pick him up you look like crap he couldn't hardly walk.
Yeah I mean you could tell he'd been in bed all day wasn't shower he wasn't clean.
Close on all awkwardly couldn't get dressed by myself.
After spending another full day in bad Scott told Lisa he finally felt well enough to return to work I woke up that morning he was in bed with me by then asking how I felt I asking did you need a ride to work because you don't have scars there he said no was friend was coming form and just as me getting a glass of water and some sinus medicine which I did brought it to him and then I left when I came home.
He was gone.
When Scott's friends stop by the apartment to pick him up there was no answer.
Just never heard from.
Two days later leisure called Scott's father in Pennsylvania to see if he had heard from Scott and it's a young woman's voice and she goes into I don't know if I'm talking to who I'm talking to but I assume you're Scott's father because I found the telephone number on the telephone bill and I said well that's right I'm Scott father but who are you she said well I've been living with Scott for a couple months now and for some time we've been together for some time and I said well I don't know really know who you are Jim Dunn filed a missing persons report with the Lubbock police department what was your last so.
Police wondered whether Scott Dunn's personal life held some clues to his disappearance.
Winds done disappeared from Lubbock Texas without a trace his friends told police this was out of character the way Scott was he would he would have called at least Hey look.
Not here in Mexico.
Scott live in girlfriend Alisha Hamilton told police that when she returned from work Scott was gone she also said that a large piece of carpet was missing from under the sofa.
When police searched the bedroom they discovered that another piece of carpet in the bedroom had also been removed and replaced with the carpet from under the sofa.
Along the edge with some rust colored stains this time around the age of that patching the original carpet was very evident to anybody who's been doing this for any length of time it was blood.
When the carpet batch was lifted police noticed it was held together with duct tape on the under padding was another large stain which also appeared to be blind in one spot it soak through a hole in the padding to the cement floor underneath and it looked as if someone had washed blood from the baseboard to find out investigators used a chemical called luminol which can detect areas where blood has been cleaned up with water and detergents.
The luminol revealed a scene of horrific violence.
I can actually see the pattern you can see her blood had been and my initial reaction was that something had occurred in that apartment.
Somebody had very obviously try to clean the whole thing up and done a fairly good job of it I just knew that he was dead.
I felt very confident that he wished he was dead.
As probably the longest day of my life and it was the most devastating thing and it never happened to me.
But I want to kill Scott done and why.
Don had a previous arrest and conviction for possession of cocaine but the theory that this was somehow drug related was inconsistent with the crime scene.
If it was a drug hit they probably would lift the person there one everybody in the world to see so that that nobody else would crossing in this this crime scene was covered up and the only reason it was covered up was because it was trying to be a police also discovered Scott Dunn was leading a Secret Life.
While living with Lisa Hamilton he continued to date numerous other women he was wild.
He played the field he had in my opinion he had a history of abusing women for his own purposes in fact he was engaged to be married to a young lady in the metroplex while he was living with me should handle.
Lisa Hamilton learned about Scott's engagement just one month earlier this call is.
Yeah all this.
And Lucia herself was a user and when it became apparent to her that she in this situation was not the user but was in fact the UC she became enraged.
What was that sufficient motive for Lisa Hamilton to murder Scott Dunn and if so.
Where was the body.
And continued to call Jim Dunn from Texas keeping him informed of the investigation into Scott's disappearance but she asked for something in return she wanted Scott's yellow sports car.
Jim done take those telephone conversations.
One car and I have promised you the car when this is all over but you don't seem to want to wait.
Actually I don't I don't I don't want right now getting the only thing I want is the car that's the only thing I wanted from the garden that's the only thing I want now.
Background check by Lubbock police revealed that Lisa Hamilton.
But at least she was involved in Scott's disappearance why had she helped police by pointing out the missing carpet in their apartment.
Lisa told Scott's father which she thought a man named Tim Smith had something to do with Scott's disappearance Tim Smith was a guy that lived in the apartment nearly ship he had been brought up in a very strict very religious environment my theory was that this was the first real contact he'd ever had with a worldly woman and that he became enamored with her and the way she made him feel and he just felt hill fell head over heels in love with.
Police discovered that Smith did not show up for work on the day Scott Dunn disappeared.
When police visited Tim Smith's apartment to ask a few questions we noticed he was packing to move.
We'Re investigating the disappearance of Scott Dunn.
Whatever I can do to help.
And if we take a look around.
Sure go ahead.
When they walked back into the living room they noticed that something that had been sitting on the bookshelf disappeared.
But behind some books on another shelf police found what they were looking for the duck tape that was on the shelf just a few minutes early.
That was a stroke of luck but it's also good investigative work I mean how many times you walk into a place where guys are moving and she really duct tape and think nothing of it.
The duct tape was sent to the forensic laboratory for analysis the tape in Smith's apartment looked very similar to the tape on the carpet patch in Dunn's apartment.
The samples were analyzed using Infor spectro potom entry where infrared light is passed through the duct tape.
And the detector.
Well the term and how much wavelength of light is being absorbed different ways.
The results are then printed out in a chart in the case of Roger Scott Dunn the duct tape we separated out into its components.
The fibers that run along the duct tape.
The backing of the duct tape and adhesive on the duct tape.
As you can see the infrared spectrum from the roll of duct tape found at the.
Suspect'S house and the duct tape found at the scene are consistent in the fiber compound.
And the roll of tape held even more clues on the side of the role we're green nylon fibers trilobal or triangular in shape they were the same size and shape and made of the same polymers and died the same color as the carpet in Scott Dunn's bedroom.
I feel confident that the fibers on the side of the duct tape came from the apartment and that the.
Duct tape underneath the carpet came from the.
But without a body authorities were hesitant to conclude homicide a lot of it had to do with the body we had nobody and the district attorney's office at that time was very apprehensive to try to take something to trial where you had no no corpus delicti that's what they say.
Full year past and Jim Dunn decided to take matters into his own hands he heard about a group of international forensic experts to meet several times a year in Philadelphia to study on solve murders the group of eighty two members it's called the doc society named after Eugene France wants the dock and eighteenth century French detective considered to be the father of modern criminal investigation.
One of the co founders of the V. dot society Richard Walter agreed to listen to Mr done story well after about an hour and a half of me presenting showing pictures and listening to some tape recordings and things I had he looked me straight in the eye.
And said Jim aren't you tired of being the grieving father and he looked at me and he said I thought I was supposed to be.
And I said no you're supposed to be god damn mad let's go after that bitch.
Richard Walter was convinced it Lisa Hamilton held the key to Scott Dunn's disappearance Walter sent the crime scene photos to Dr Richard shepherd a forensic pathologist at Scotland Yard in London after reviewing the information Dr shepherd concluded that Scott don had been murdered in the corner of his bedroom the result of multiple blunt trauma injuries but at the time under Texas law without a body there was no homicide.
Armed with Dr shepherd's forensic analysis Richard Walter pleaded the case to the district attorney arguing that they had a body part is about part of bodies that as it builds connective tissue.
Prosecutors brought in their own blood spatter expert Tom bevel to confirm the findings of doctor show.
According to babble the blood spatter pattern on the walls indicated three distinct lines of castoff blood from a web.
For example if we had three cast all stains or going three direction that would be consistent with three blows plus the one to create the blood in the first place in this case would say there was a minimum of four blows it was delivered.
To find out how much blood Scott Dunn lost during the assault double conducted a blood saturation test.
During human blood onto a test piece of carpet devil created the same size stain found in the bedroom in this case two hundred sixty six square inches.
It took just under two units of blood to create the stain and soaked through to the padding underneath if you take that in consideration with all the other physical there such as the blood queen up cutting out of the carpet the blood spatter the cast all this to the wall and also to the ceiling along with that blood volume it certainly is a high suspicion that somebody in fact Tuesday.
Authorities were now convinced that Scott Dunn had been murdered in his bedroom.
Lubbock police suspected that both Lisa Hamilton and Tim Smith were somehow involved in Scott Dunn's murder but they had no evidence linking leisure to the crime and the only link to Smith was the duct tape.
Until Richard Walter discovered something that was previously overlooked Walter learned that several strands of unidentified here had been found on the duct tape in Scott Dunn's bedroom he suggested the here be sent for forensic analysis.
At the FBI lab in Washington DC the hair from the duct tape underneath the carpet was compared to hear samples from Lisa Hamilton and Tim Smith no Scott Dunn hairs were found on that tape the both the hairs of Felicia Hamilton and Tim Smith were found on that duct tape holding it in which means when that duct tape was put down in that patch put in place they were there.
Five and a half years after Scott Dunn's disappearance Lisa Hamilton and Tim Smith were arrested and charged with murder.
Prosecutors believe that police has motive was revenge but she was angry when she learned that Scott was engaged to another woman.
She'S a hard as rocks bright grassy works smart.
But it has this insatiable appetite for power control crushing people.
She dismisses you you don't dismiss her Leisha Hamilton was the absolute instigator ringleader and she was the wicked witch of the west who contrive developed leading covered up this whole thing.
It'S got done was murdered in the early morning hours of may sixteenth nineteen ninety one.
And struck at least four times with a blunt object.
About two units of Scott's blood was lost in the attack.
As Scott's body was removed from the apartment his blood was transferred on to the bedroom door.
The location of the body is still unknown.
The cover up failed because the water and detergents could not remove the hemoglobin components of the blood which later the rest when sprayed with the chemical luminol.
A piece of carpet from under the sofa in the living room was used to patch the bloodstained carpet in the bedroom.
The duct tape used to patch the constant together untamed strands of hair consistent with hair samples from both Lisa Hamilton and Tim Smith.
Some straight carpet fibers the role was later found in ten Smith's apartment Lisa Hamilton and Tim Smith were tried separately and both were convicted of murder.
Lisa Hamilton was sentenced to twenty years.
Tim Smith received a ten year probation.
The jury I think believe that perhaps she had a great deal to do with disposing of the body but they didn't believe he was actually there when the murder took place and I think for that reason they recommended the judge imposed probation instead of syncing him to a term in the penitentiary which would be carried out.
Although the body of Scott Dunn has never been found.
I'M hopeful that at some point.
Somebody will talk and then we can recover his remains and still we can have a decent burial and.
They sent ceremony that can put in the ration I feel totally absolved that point I've done everything I could do if I can ever reach that point I'm quite reach that yet and I still crosses my mind what else I can do but at this point I'm gonna let it go and help somebody with a good larger somebody will give us some direction on what that actually means in my life at some point.
