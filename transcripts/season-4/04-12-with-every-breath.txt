In nineteen ninety three on an Indian reservation in the southwestern United States young Navajo Indians were dying at an alarming rate.
More than twenty people would die from the mysterious disease one that health officials I'd never seen before.
But the Navajo medicine man provided critical piece of information which led investigators around the world to a most unlikely killer.
Covering twenty five thousand square miles of high desert in four states Utah Colorado New Mexico and Arizona is the Navajo Indian reservation in an area known as the four corners.
It'S the largest Navajo community in America with some twelve hundred members of the tribe living throughout the desert hills.
The scenery brings thousands of tourists each year a vital source of revenue for the Navajo who have inhabited the area for centuries.
Poverty is endemic it was a fact of life for people like nineteen year old Meryl body Meryl by he had something that set him apart.
Maria was very nominal person but where he stood out was his running ability and I think if you talk to anybody that someone you know that they would tell you that it was a gift that he had in running any left to run.
by he was so fast he won a full scholarship to the Santa Fe Indian school a boarding school that was miles away from his home both physically and culturally.
He didn't really know how.
To put a sheet on a blade on a bid or.
No it was a lie he threw the blanket on and that was it that no moral use you put this down first so I had to show him how to.
To make up a bit.
Bye he slowly adjusted to his new life he did well in school but the transition to life in the city was difficult until he met the Reno woody.
Something magical happened he met another Navajo girl in a public school and I fell in love so intensely that the track coach decided to make Florina the manager of the track team to hand out the towel so that Meryl would keep his mind on his running not long afterwards they had a son Maurice and planned to get married but shortly after the baby was born Serena woke up one morning with what she thought was the flu she was all call she kept in handy's chills.
And it was it was something that you hate you you're getting a cold or getting sick from work a common cold.
Everyone sort of white out meaning they were just silent they should usually be dark from from the air and they obviously had something in their fluid in there.
Doctors raced to find out what was wrong they administered oxygen to help to read a breeze but she went into shock I saw one of the nurses coming out of her own all this term she was crying Anna Anna I knew that something was happening none of the standard procedures worked and Farinas heart stopped beating the pressure on her lungs was simply too much for her body to bear.
The cause of death acute respiratory thing here.
Marino woody died on mother's day she was just twenty one years old.
Doctors had no idea what it calls for Reno sudden death and they feared that what ever killed for Reno woody might be contagious.
Lorena'S death was a particularly cruel blow to Meryl by.
The mother of his infant son was dead as bar he prepared for Farinas funeral he too started to develop similar symptoms Merillat he was beside himself.
He wasn't feeling well.
It didn't occur to him.
That it could possibly be the same thing that affected florea Meryl's physical condition quickly deteriorated and he was rushed to the Crown Point hospital the same hospital that treated for rain.
After an initial consultation Meryl did not want to be treated where Florina died so his family drove him to the Indian Medical Center in Gallup an hour away shortly before arrival Meryl lost consciousness.
As doctors rushed him into the emergency room he died.
The cause of death acute respiratory failure.
Meryl by he was only nineteen years old ironically Meryl died during Florida's funeral service which was taking place directly across the street from the hospital.
The machine was going on and there we had a meeting with our medical investigator.
And they were told there.
And everything to start happening here and there and and that's when I went to shock.
Health authorities had no explanation for what killed the young couple the only way they could determine the cause was to perform a complete autopsy but autopsies are not permitted in the Navajo community it's forbidden in among traditional apples to have autopsies done and an apple tribal government can for for a bit.
That if they want to and I don't think the government people really understood that that we have that sovereign power to do that even if it's a medical emergency but with her daughter and future son in law today Peter Begay wanted answers she took the unusual step of defying tradition and the tribal elders by giving doctors permission to perform the autopsies.
The autopsy findings took on a new importance when Meryl and chlorine is in child Mari's also fell ill.
He was rushed to the hospital and quarantine.
What is it.
Where do you come from our.
What is is it gonna is it going to be here or how you know asks I had that I had those questions and I wanted to find out.
As authorities awaited the autopsy results the disease continued its deadly rampage.
Within a week of arena and Meryl stats the number of dead had risen to six and each day more people were being hospitalized with symptoms.
New Mexico officials feared they had an epidemic on their hands and panic gripped the region.
We'Re getting calls from concerned citizens and concert physicians and concerned school administrators and concerned everybody and that always will happen when something as dramatic as this is frightening this is occurring and when you do really don't have any good answers the autopsies on Meryl by he and Serena woody answered a few questions the mystery illness could not be identified and until it was more people were destined to die.
On over to a deadly respiratory illness may nineteen ninety three now the whole radio stations in the four corners Indian reservation broadcast an alert young Navajo were dying at an alarming rate and new cases were being reported every day.
So little was known that health officials were not able to tell listeners what precautions to take against the disease it was frightening for people who came down with a fever and cough and headache at the time as a physician we're sending people home who knew we had to accept the possibility that they could drop dead within hours of leaving the hospital the outbreak was now national news and since it appeared that only Navajo were affected it was dubbed the Navajo flu there was pandemonium.
It'S impossible to keep a string of deaths like this a secret for very long one possibility was bubonic plague the dreaded black death that killed millions during the Middle Ages and still strikes more than a thousand people worldwide every year.
Plague symptoms particularly the high fever muscle pain and fluid build up bore similarities to the four corners disease provided play still crops up in New Mexico from time to time and so the state is very well equipped to do that test and much to the to the.
Chagrin of the investigators the test was negative if the Wilshire grand because they still didn't know what he killed this young couple another possibility was Monica play a highly contagious disease that attacks the lungs and kills quickly which is what happened to the four corners victims since it could be treated with large doses of antibiotics doctors actually hope that this was what they define but the autopsies turned up something different the capillaries of the victims had collapsed leaving the lions wet like large sponges this was not consistent with new monic plate and it did not resemble anything medical investigators had ever seen before and it was very puzzling and it was it was frustrating because you felt like how come we're not smart enough to figure this out.
You know this this shouldn't be that hard.
So I haven't had I haven't had that many cases at one time they didn't understand.
Local health officials called in the centers for disease control in Atlanta Georgia.
The CDC's special pathogens team was sent in to look for possible causes and they started their investigation in the trailer Meryl by he and Cllr Reno would be once called home we had no idea what this once we did the weather was contagious we didn't know whether working with tissues was going to be dangerous we know whether you can get this and laboratory or from somebody outside of the field.
The outbreak was considered a biosafety level four hazard the most.
Dressed in specially designed suits to keep them free from any contagion CDC specialists searched the trailer and the surrounding area the war or something like that you know that astronaut said to deter send enough to other space and you know how to dress they were dressed like that when they came to our place.
And that was even scarier.
While the medical community turned to their scientific experts the napa who turned to their own specialist the traditional heaters or medicine man who were responsible for the health of the reservation they said they were familiar with this disease and that it struck before they were saying that this outbreak had occurred in the sentry in nineteen thirty three in nineteen eighteen when it was preceded by two years plentiful rains and heavy winter snows in the mountains.
Peter said the heavy rains had resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of mice on the reservation and they suspected there was some connection between the large number of mice and these debts but they could not say what it was there's an old apple saying that it learned as a child that my phone mail server runs up your clothing you should burn it and nobody ever knew what that old sayings meant records indicated that there were heavy rains in nineteen ninety one and ninety two two years preceding the current outbreak.
But health officials could not find any link between the rain the growing deer mice population and the outbreak.
Meanwhile in what's known as the maximum containment section of the CDC labs an area reserved for the study of the world's most dangerous germs and viruses investigators performed an ally said test or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay on the tissue samples from the victims when a disease strikes the body reacts by producing antibodies which are unique to that disease.
The elisa test can isolate those antibodies in order to compare them to the thousands of samples in the CDC files.
Comparison after comparison was made and no matches were found until the investigation took an unexpected turn.
One that would take medical detectives back in time and halfway around the world.
Within six weeks of marina woody and Meryl by his stats more than twelve other young people have also died of the same mysterious disease investigators got a break in the case when a tourist from Iceland after visiting the reservation develop symptoms of the disease investigators now realized the outbreak was probably environmental and was not confined to the Navajo unfortunately somebody sort of identified this is a Navajo disease which is very obviously wasn't because we were saying.
There there were other cases occurring in in Navajos but but that that was particularly offensive listen to people when CDC investigators compared the anti bodies from the outbreak victims to those in their bass filed known diseases they made a surprising discovery the only sample it was in any way similar was one that was forty years old it was a sample taken from a soldier stationed in Korea in nineteen fifty.
During the Korean War more than three thousand troops developed high fevers and kidney failure about four hundred died.
Doctors called it hanta virus because it was traced back to Korea's hantaan river that region was home to large numbers of striped field mice.
Feces and urine from infected mice carried the virus when it dried out it became airborne and was then inhaled by the soldiers from there the virus attacks the kidneys but investigators were uncertain whether this was the same as the four corners virus never been a hanta virus reported in North America and the four corners disease attacks the lungs not the kidneys I had no idea what kind of pictures for us and looked looked in the you know my text book which had a very short section on the.
And of course it describes a disease that occurs in Asia which which sounded nothing like what we were dealing with.
Was this the same disease and if so how did it travel from Korea to a north American Indian reservation.
CDC investigators then remembered what they'd been told by the Navajo traditional healers the medicine man had said it won a remarkably what winter was followed by.
The masking of the the pinyon trees when when the Kenyan trees put out an abundant supply of nuts the rodent populations in the state began to grow and when that happens.
Investigators caught and tested deer mice from the four corners area they found the mice were shedding the virus with the same DNA profile as the virus found in the Reno woody and Meryl by.
But the DNA profile of this virus was not identical to the Caribbean hantavirus although the DNA profiles were similar the strain from the Navajo reservation was a new one unique to North America what we found when we did the comparison was that this was a new hantavirus that is the sequence was far enough from any other known Han of ours that we were convinced that it was a new virus it wasn't just a minor variance on one of the old viruses CDC scientist in Navajo medicine men suspected the north American hanta virus has been around for centuries but since the cases were so isolated it had always been misdiagnosed the Navajo made up a greater percentage of the victims only because they lived in more rural areas with large deer mice populations.
In the two years before the outbreak heavy spring rains created a bumper crop of pinon nuts are rich source of food for the growing mice population.
Authorities believe that Meryl by he and Cllr Reno would again hailed the dried urine and fecal matter from the infected deer mice when they were house cleaning or digging in their garden in my heart I think it's it was god's will that.
This is what was supposed to happen to both of them and they were meant for each other and.
They were meant to go together.
Health officials recommend that the masks and gloves be worn when cleaning rodent droppings.
And the people do everything possible to keep rodents out of their home.
They also point out that the four corners outbreak was identified through the wisdom of the Navajo medicine man.
And the scientists who were smart enough to listen we're discovering an old disease that the traditional healers had discovered long ago and that was done I think to me does the most exciting thing about this whole investigation the Navajo using an entirely different approach looking at the balance of nature were able to identify factors.
That led them to the same conclusion that day when rodent populations explode the way they did in the four corners in the spring of nineteen ninety three young Navajo died.
These two very different.
Sets of people.
Sent out on very different paths and arrived in the same place.
