Eleven year old Ricky stats and went for an evening run on a jogging trail in Portland Maine.
Witnesses recalled seeing the boy and a young man right behind him on a bicycle.
The next day Ricky Stephens body was discovered in a nearby ravine.
He had been murdered.
The killer left very few clues but he left behind something he couldn't hide his signature.
Eleven year old Ricky Stetson and his family lived in a working class section of Portland Maine a coastal city known primarily as a summer vacation destination.
Around eight PM on August twenty third nineteen eighty three Ricky went for a short run along the biking and jogging path called black call.
He never returned home.
His body was discovered the next day in a grassy area just off the jogging path there was evidence both externally and internally as I recall of its fixation that isn't joking around the back.
And it appeared to the medical examiner's though he was he was choked manually and probably by a lecture he had also been stabbed the autopsy revealed that the boy had not been sexually assaulted but there were bite wounds on various parts of his body.
And the bite marks had been gouged with a knife none of the forensic dentists had seen a case before in which there had been a bite mark was slashing and cutting through it as if to hide the bite mark.
and so that's what the law calls a signature crime that is it is done in a way that is very unique that is very unusual that the culprit the perpetrator is leaving as it were his signature.
on the crime.
To Portland police Ricky Stetson's murderer appeared similar to a series of knifings that occurred two years earlier in Oakdale section of the city.
Michael with them was just nine years old when he had an encounter with the so called Oakdale slasher there's a wooded lot between a couple of houses.
Which have a couple of pounds and.
With him gone away injury was just inches from being face required twelve stitches to close.
All with the same as the attacker was a white male in his late teens or early twenties.
That description was similar to the one of the man seen riding his bicycle behind Ricky steps.
For a full year police searched for the killer and eventually they identified a suspect twenty four year old Joseph Anderson he was also a suspect in the attempted murder of a nine year old girl.
There was a problem.
Police in Bellevue Nebraska had a similar murder a thirteen year old boy with stab wounds and markings identical to Ricky Stetson's.
If the Nebraska murder was related to the statutes and case in Maine.
Joseph Anderson wasn't the killer.
The serial murderer was on the loose on the fifteen hundred mile killing spree.
In the fall of nineteen eighty three police in Bellevue Nebraska we're searching for a missing thirteen year old boy Dani Jo Everly Danny Joe had been delivering newspapers early one Sunday morning when he mysteriously disappeared he's partially through his paper route and now it's disappeared.
And he wasn't with any S. playmates individual to use wasn't in the neighborhoods and we knew something was terribly wrong right.
Danny Joe's bicycle was found in front of a home he delivered newspapers to but there was no sign of a struggle no sign of the boy and his bicycle.
Brothers sisters mother and dad said his whole life is that bicycle he that's why delivered newspapers to buy the surgeries and keep the bicycle shining was really proud of it.
Police search for Dani Jo Everly across the state of Nebraska.
His picture was seen on nightly television programs and in the newspapers.
Three days later investigators worst fears were realized.
Dani Jo a police body was found on a desolate stretch of road four miles from his bicycle he had been stabbed to death.
The town's mayor Joe Baldwin personally delivered the news to the boy's mother we broke the news tour and we were all crying into the FBI guy he was growing he was crying and I was crying the chief was Cryin they're very traumatic type thing to tell someone your son is found in these did very most dramatic thing I think I've ever done.
Dani Jo Emily's hands and feet were tied with rope and a star pattern had been cut into his chest there was no sign of sexual assault.
Police turn to FBI behavioral analyst Robert wrestler for a psychological profile of the killer we had a biter Linda vigil was compelled by his victims and cutting the flesh away to deny that evidence the police.
Since the body was found so close to the road wrestler suspected the killer was slightly built and not strong enough to carry the body very far the location also told wrestler that the killer was inexperienced and it was right off the side of the road really it would indicate to me that the killer was and in a little state of panic.
Want to get rid of the body didn't want to be found with the body of the car but but wasn't sophisticated or knowledgeable enough about the area to do it effectively and it would indicate to me possibly this may have been the first time that he had killed in this particular area.
The rope used to bind Dani Jo Everly was of particular interest to investigators and was sent to FBI headquarters in Washington DC.
Special agent Wayne Oakes conducted the analysis I had never seen anyone like this none of the other examiners in the laboratory who deal with ropes on a daily basis or number of years had ever seen a worldwide.
The out side of the road was common white nylon but the inner core was extremely unusual.
Twenty four different types of fibers and one hundred six different colored yarns they were polyesters nylons Raytheon's acrylics polyethylene swirls and cottons which is what made the rope unique.
Oaks took the rope to the national cordage institute a trade association of all rope manufacturers in the United States their technical experts had never seen a rope like this either.
Back in Bellevue Nebraska police were desperate to find the killer Dani Jo Everly and parents were warned to keep a close eye on their children people are reluctant to let their children out to go sledding or skating or any the other normal activities children are watched over at shopping centers that the parents are keeping a very tight rein on their children for their safety.
Despite the precautions beyond thinkable happened again.
Another young boy twelve year old Christopher Walden was abducted as he walked to school it was about eight blocks from his house again in Bellevue.
And he was at a four way stop when a young man came up and forced him into the car and drove off with.
The sub zero temperatures police search for Christopher Walton.
Three days later a group of pheasant hunters stumbled upon a snow covered thank you.
Christopher Walton's frozen body was found in the same area as Dani Jo Everly he's.
Like Danny Joe Walton had been stabbed to death and he had the same star shaped pattern etched on his body.
Two sets of footprints leading into the woods where Christopher Walton's body was discovered but only one set of footprints left the scene an indication the killer did not have an accomplice the star shaped pattern told investigators that this was the same individual who killed Danny Jo Everly three months early.
Witnesses saw Christopher Walton with the young white male in his early twenties on the walkway near the school from those descriptions police created a composite drawing which was distributed to newspapers and local television stations.
Robert Ressler refined his profile of the killer with information gathered from the second merger I felt that the individual because of this need to be close to young males and having a traction for them if you would be involved in some sort of activities with you soccer coach baseball coach Boy Scouts since the killer was using a knife to obscure the bite wounds wrestler suspected that the killer red police and detective magazines because matching bite wounds to a dental impression is often discussed in these types of publications.
Talk to a woman who was walking her dog near the intersection at the time Christopher Walton was abducted she thought she saw the adoption she wasn't entirely sure so police asked her to undergo knows.
Hypnosis can sometimes help the witness to recall details of an event they can't otherwise remember but hypnotic Lee enhanced recollections are usually not admissible in court she underwent hypnosis and something came out in the session and it was just driving her crazy and it all came back to work and that's when she realized that she had seen Christopher Walden being kidnapped.
She said that Christopher Walton was with the man who was approximately the same height.
The car leaving the scene was brown the license number started with the letter are followed by a series of numbers.
Sheriff Patrick Thomas issued a challenge to the killer during the news conference and I think that the individual who's responsible for these acts.
Is very sick.
And I would urge him to call a minister or priest for me.
There was a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking from then on that maybe they should have been done or maybe.
But I felt that.
That I would see what he's made of because I knew that he was watching the press he was watching TV he was monitoring us as much as they do as part of their profile is brother MO.
And I figured that maybe he would make a mistake and it works.
A local woman Barbara weaver told friends that she had been praying for the capture of the serial murderer and she did something else.
In her prayers she offered herself in any way possible to help find the killer.
Barbara weaver worked in a day care center and she usually arrived at work early to get her classroom ready.
When she looked outside she noticed a strange car in the parking the driver was wearing the ski and looks similar to the composite drawings of the killer she saw on television.
As she was writing down the license plate number the man entered the class.
Mrs weaver ran past him and fled to the house next door which belong to the pastor of the church from there she called police.
Inch but the fact is she gonna say she when she saw the car she said that looks like a car of this killer we were installed on everyone's mind this is the biggest case I've ever had Nebraska.
Police tracked the license plate number to a nineteen year old enlisted man stationed at Offutt Air Force base his name was John Schubert.
Two bird was a maintenance mechanic in the radar unit he was also an Eagle Scout and was an assistant scout leader for a local troop.
You were denied having anything to do with the two murders but there was an interesting coincidence Schubert had been living in Portland Maine the year before at the time of Ricky Stetson's merger.
When John Schubert was questioned about the murders of Danny Joe a billion Christopher Walden he had little to say to investigators.
But he fit the FBI's profile of the killer he was nineteen years old slightly built and Eagle Scout volunteered his time as an assistant scout leader of a local troop.
Ljungberg red soft core pornography and detective magazines which were found in his foot locker at the Air Force base.
What police found in his automobile was of particular interest on the right.
The brown Caucasian head hair which was sent to the FBI for analysis.
Microscopic examination of the question here is found from the vacuum sweepings in the vehicle with the known standards from the victim they were the same microscopically and I indicated in my report that there isn't a vehicle is consistently.
From the victim enjoyable.
Police also found a knife and a roll of tape.
And in two parts automobile was a piece of rope at first it appeared to be common nylon rope similar to the type sold in thousands of retail outlets throughout the United States but inside the rope was a surprise the portable so unique with a hundred and six different fibers and every single one of those fibers was mounted on a glass microscope than the generic classified was identified to make sure they they were same color composition I am a cross sectional shape and to make sure that the acetates match the acetates in the poly athletes match the poly athletes I found that they were identical in all respects microscopically instrumentally chemical tests there were no differences between the two ropes Schubert had no idea the rope was so rare he said he had been given the rope years earlier in the Boy Scouts when confronted with the evidence Schubert confessed.
Said let me tell you about the second boy first because it's fresh in my mind.
And we started questioning him and he told us and provided us with facts concerning the.
Killings and the abduction of both boys it would only be known to the individual that had committed the crimes.
Uber also admitted that he was the Oakdale slasher and his attacks on people like Michael with practice for his subsequent killing spree.
He also revealed that after killing Dani Jo Everly he walked into a McDonald's restaurant washed the blood from his hands in the men's room and ordered some breakfast.
After the Christopher Walton murder you but said he attended a boy scout meeting where he was an assistant troop leader at that meeting the troops discuss the adoptions guys no one has to look out for each other nothing to worry.
After one hundred sixteen days and one of the most intensive manhunts in Nebraska history.
Police finally had their killer and Portland Maine.
Hubert was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Ricky staffs and.
In Nebraska for the murders of Danny Joe Billy and Christopher Walton your bird was convicted and sentenced to death.
I specifically asked him if he disliked the boys in his statement was how could I dislike him I didn't even on.
No one knows what drove John Schubert to kill.
And I remember one day I said to John if I let you out of jail today.
Let you walk away from here.
do you think you've learned all that you would never do that again.
Thought for quite some time he says no.
Do you mean you'd go kill another little boy.
On July seventeenth nineteen ninety six John Ljungberg was put to death in the electric chair.
Jupiter'S presence is still felt to this day in the small town of Bellevue.
Former mayor Joe Baldwin regularly visits the victim's grades and remembers the one hundred sixteen days when the serial killer stalked his community.
Most horrible thing that ever happened in this city you know for to have young a young person like that to young persons and even three when.
To have their life taken away by a person like that I think that is terrible it's it's you can't believe how dramatic it is one that is.
Just the other day in a grocery store a lady said to choose just fearful over little boy.
Play an after dark.
She remembers you were.
I told you to never happen again but make sure she keeps lateral board.
I just have to be careful children have to be very careful.
