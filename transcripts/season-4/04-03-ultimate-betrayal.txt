On a windy October night in nineteen ninety five a mysterious house fire swept through the palatial home of the doctor and his family.
Two of the family members made it out alive two of the children did not.
In the debris medical detectives discovered much more than simply how the fire started.
Michael Farrar and Debra green first met in medical school in nineteen seventy seven both were gifted students with near genius I cues there was an instant attraction and they married less than a year after they met.
Over the next sixteen years the couple raised three children Jennifer Timothy and Kelly in an affluent suburb of Kansas city Kansas.
To outsiders your life seems perfect but the marriage was showing signs of stress.
The north Kansas city hospital Dr Michael Farrar was a successful heart specialist to work very long hours often at the expense of time with his children.
Deborah quit her own medical practice when the children were born she battled depression weight gain and was rumored to have a drinking problem you got the impression that they ever wasn't the easiest person the world to live with she was.
In an effort to rekindle their marriage the couple decided to go on a school trip to Peru with their son ten.
While sight seeing along the Amazon River and among the Incan remains an attractive blonde nurse caught Michael's attention she was the mother of one of the other students when they return to Kansas city.
Michael continued to see his new friend but soon blossomed into a sexual affair it didn't take Debra long to find out about her husband's affair she moved into a separate bedroom and her drinking increased for calling in a T. was her marriage and her family because she didn't.
No longer had her own career but fill it you maybe it was just really hard for her to let go of that maybe she felt like.
She could change or something to change and they could somehow stay together and Michael had some serious problems of his own shortly after the Peru trip Michael developed diarrhea and vomiting and chills so severe he was admitted to the local hospital he'd been in South America where he might have had access to a whole variety of things that that could make him very sick.
Despite undergoing a full battery of tests doctors could not determine the cause of doctor Farrar's illness when I saw was like Mike man you look bad I'm sorry but you don't look good and he said he'd been sick really really violently ill since he got back from prison he is saying that he got some tropical parasite from help Michael Farrar was rapidly losing weight dropping to just one hundred twenty five pounds.
Whatever was causing this illness.
Was a mystery.
For a cardiologists to seemingly had it all Dr Michael Farrar's life in nineteen ninety five was one crisis after another.
When he was released from the hospital for the onus many believed he caught in Peru Michael took another step towards divorce by moving into his own apartment across town.
His wife Deborah was angry depressed drinking heavily and would stay in her bedroom for days at a time.
Michael was concerned for her welfare as well as the safety of their three children.
While visiting the house to pick up some of these things Michael noticed something suspicious in his wife's purse.
A packet of castor beans.
On the label was a warning that the beans were poisonous.
With so many packets of castor beans in her purse Michael suspected that his wife was planning to commit suicide.
So he's telling me he's pretty sure she's kind of trying to kill herself with these boys which really to me didn't make any sense because Dr green is that a bright woman damaged extremely bright woman and is an oncologist and if you're a doctor I mean doctors kill themselves are I mean in professional people do commit suicide before cello we've got the best of drugs available to us I mean if you're going to go why would you go steeling yourself to death I mean you are gonna want to die with bloody diarrhea I mean that is a very horrible bad way to die.
Dr Farrar decided to do a little investigating up is on.
The caster beans were purchased from the own a garden center a receipt from next door in Debra's purse indicated she purchased the beans just four days before Michael first got sick.
While consulting his medical textbook Farrar learned some terrible news the caster beans contain ricin a deadly toxin with no known antidote.
And the symptoms of ricin poisoning were vomiting nausea diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding symptoms which were identical to his own.
Farrar quickly took a sample of his own blood testing but rice and leaves the body quickly in the land could find no trace of it in his system.
Although he had no proof Farrar was convinced that his wife had somehow poisoned him with the ricin and this was the cause of his mysterious symptoms.
A few days later Michael confronted Deborah during an angry telephone call I told her that I was.
Very angry with her that I thought she was crazy that I thought she had been poisoning me that I thought she needed a serious psychiatric help.
Don'T have to listen to this.
One hour later around midnight a fire broke out in the for our family home by the time fireman arrived the home was totally engulfed in flames I've never seen a fire spreads fast throughout the houses I have on this one.
This tremendous there was no way that anyone can get even get close to the house of course the flame for worn out probably twenty to thirty feet.
Deborah and her ten year old daughter Jennifer both escaped.
During questioning on the night of the fire Deborah learned the tragic news that her other two children had been trapped and died in the fire who used to live.
Six year old Kelly died of smoke inhalation in a wrong bad.
Thirteen year old ten burned to death.
Investigators immediately suspected arson.
It'S fair to say that their program was a suspect early on it's fair to say that Mike Ferraro was a suspect early on.
Both had motive.
If the fire had been deliberately set the charge would be more than arson.
It would be merged.
While investigating the suspicious house fire that killed him and Kelly Farrar police looked a little deeper into the relationship between Michael and his estranged wife Deborah a few weeks before the fire the couple had a fight at the house Michael said his wife was intoxicated angry and threatening to kill herself.
Police were called to Deborah to the hospital for psychiatric evaluation Dr Pamela McCoy was a physician on duty Pam McCoy indicated that at first she was somewhat skeptical about whether or not Deborah green was really that mentally ill and it's sitting there in the in the waiting room of the K. U. Medical Center emergency room talking to Debra green about these issues ask her if she's okay if there's anything she can do to help her and trying to get a read on her mental state when in March in walks Michael Ferrari when they met in our kind of entryway there she just like turns on him like she's I mean a ferment I kinda holder like I think she's going to physically attack him and she spits at him and called him a coke and then she says you're going to get these kids over their dead bodies.
Deborah said she made the statement in anger and denied having anything to do with the fire.
She said she was asleep when the fire alarm sounded.
She said she opened the bedroom door frames and closed the door and ran outside through a door in the bedroom.
Fireman arrived and ran to the next door neighbor's house for help.
To find out whether in excel around or flammable liquid was used in starting the fire arson investigators used specially trained dogs that can identify papers which remain after the fire this is a dog that has been through several weeks of training on how to how to detect different types of liquid accelerates like diesel fuel or kerosene or gasoline or charcoal lighter fluid the dogs identified a number of suspicious areas.
Investigators found melted plastic containers on the floor possibly used to carry flammable liquids throughout the house.
Next to Dr Ferrari's desk investigators found another clue that the fire had been intentionally set.
We found an empty liquor bottle laying on the floor right behind.
This is desk again this it's possible that the contents of this bottle were poured out in in at night it on the desk.
A section of the basement floor had what appeared to be a poor pattern where an ex tolerant was ignited as a test for the excel rinse also gave investigators a clear path of the fire.
The past led directly to Deborah Greene's bedroom door.
That fire was set at that bedroom door with the intent of doing a tremendous amount of damage to that house and cutting off the escape route of those children upstairs and the analysis of the burn patterns on the bedroom door contradicted Deborah Greene's story.
Deborah said her bedroom door was closed when the fire alarm sounded she closed the door before running outside for help.
But the carpet underneath the door revealed the door had been opened the door jamb revealed the same thing if the door had been closed the door jam would have been protected from the fire instead it was completely covered with such.
In the bathroom was Deborah's bathrobe wrapped in a ball on the floor on the under side of the road were burn marks at some point the person wearing the robe had been very close to the flames.
The neighbors said Deborah's hair was wet when she ran over asking for help this did not come as a surprise to arson investigators.
When Dr green actually ignited that excel right outside of her bedroom door and in the hallway that there was enough vapors present that there was there was quite a flash more of a flash and she probably was prepared for when she did that I believe that is when she got the hair singed on the right side of her head.
With the search warrant detectives took a sample of decorous microscopic analysis revealed that Debra's here showed signs of damage consistent with singeing from high intensity flame the damage to Debra's here was extensive since the sample wasn't collected until after she had her hair cut for her children's funeral.
Bill cheapen is a forensic chemist whose job was to analyze the fire debris evidence from the forearm on fire debris is stored in metal canisters which preserve any vapors which may still be present the canisters are heated to between eighty and ninety degrees centigrade and the air inside removed if the vapors contain excel runs or hydrocarbons they're trapped in charcoal filters the filters are then rinsed with a neutral salt and carbon disulfide and the mixture is placed into a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer for analysis.
After two days of testing build cheap and found what he was looking for this particular case the excitement that I found was an excel are called I saw paraffin I superior friends are often used in odorless charcoal lighter fluids.
There was an empty container of charcoal lighter fluid on the floor of the Ferrars garage.
Investigators were now convinced that Debra green set the fire that killed two of her children the only question that remained had she also tried to kill her husband with castor beans.
When Dr Michael Farrar told police he was sure his wife had been poisoning him with castor beans investigators were unsure of where to start since the local laboratory could find no evidence of ricin and Michael for our system his blood was sent to the FBI the doctor drew Richardson an expert in chemical and biological research at the naval medical research institute in Washington DC people in the intelligence community quite familiar with rice and based on a handful of cases that most everybody would know about very few people in the lay public and and even highly trained professionals such as medical doctors would be quite unlikely to know much about rice and if anything ricin is an antigen that causes a breakdown of red blood cells at the tissue level.
In large enough doses it can be fatal.
When an antigen enters the body the immune system's response is to produce antibodies which fight the invading organisms.
To find out whether ricin antibodies were in Michael Ferrari system Dr Richardson used a technique called a license.
Which stands for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay a ninety six well plastic plate is coated with a solution containing ricin.
In theory any ricin antibodies and doctor Farrar's blood would bind to the ricin coated on the plate which is exactly what happened next doctor Richards and analyzed the blood of goats that had been exposed to small amounts of ricin.
Here that the goats and Michael Ferrari both had similar antibodies in their systems antibodies designed and structured to recognize and seek out the target invader ricin.
Dr Richardson discovered something else the number of ricin antibodies in Farrar's system was staggering.
In the case of Dr Michael Farrar it's thought that perhaps he was exposed three times a certain immune response would have been produced the first time response who would have lasted a few weeks on second and third and perhaps other exposures a separate immune response would have been produced.
For each one of those exposures and the latter exposures would have produced a response and antibodies it would be present in the blood for again many months to perhaps a few years Deborah green was charged with two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder.
Prosecutors believe that when Debra's attempts to kill her husband failed she feared losing custody of her children in the impending divorce.
After the argument on the telephone prosecutors believe the death record X. tolerance throughout the house with special attention of Michael's possessions and making sure to cut off the children to skateboard.
The path of the excel rinsed led directly to the door of the Deborah Greene's bedroom.
While dousing her head with the water she saw that her bathrobe had also caught fire and discarded it.
Ten year old Jennifer survived by crawling out her bedroom window and jumping to the ground.
Separate told him to stay inside with the six year old sister until firemen arrived.
Sadly team did what his mother had told him to do he and Kelly both died before firemen could reach the.
Deborah green's trial was scheduled to begin one week after Michael's brain operation to repair damage caused by the ricin poisoning but the trial never took place Deborah green pleaded no contest to the charges avoiding a possible death sentence lanterns are ready willing and able to present evidence that I was not a problem at some point in the Kelly died.
However to date may be defending myself the trial on these charges would only compound the suffering that my family and my daughter she was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole for forty years.
Well I think these kids in this case which were the ultimate on the ultima weapon the debris used in this fight with Michael Farrar she in some ways probably love those kids in other ways view them as an expendable resource to be used in this war.
