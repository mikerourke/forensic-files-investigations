On June twenty first nineteen seventy eight twenty two year old karla brown was found brutally murdered in the basement of a home.
It looked as if the killer had committed the perfect crime.
Police could find very little evidence.
But years later investigators noticed something on a crime scene photographs that had previously been overlooked.
The killer had left behind.
Twenty two year old karla brown and her fiance a man we'll call Marquardt had recently purchased a home together in wood river Illinois.
Although the couple had a rocky past friends and family saw this as the beginning of a new phase in their relationship.
Carl brown was so beautiful girl.
For young woman was very popular in your hometown.
Yeah I had taken some college classes had been a high school cheerleader was one of those girls that everybody knew girls like guys like she's just one of those people that was special and everybody recognize that on June twenty first Carla brown took the day off from work to unpack.
Right and spoke to one of her friends on the telephone maybe we can have you over for dinner they had talked for a few minutes to talk about getting together later on that afternoon what is a good match herbs.
And Carlos right to the conversation and said listen I'll have to call you back I'll see you later somebody at the door and that was the last their friend never talked to.
Around five thirty that afternoon Carless fiance and his friends stop by the house after work.
When they walk into the basement they saw a horrible sight.
Carlos lying face down in a bucket of water.
She had her hands tied behind her there was evidence of struggle a death struggle in the basement and and the suit is very strong suggestion of a sexual rape.
But investigators were confused about some of the things they saw.
There were two men socks tied around Carlos neck they were tied neatly inconsistent with what you would expect to see in a life and death struggle.
The white electrical cord used to tied the victim's hands was not tight enough to effectively restrain an individual during an assault there was too much length of cord behind her to wear her hands could come up in front of her it would seem like to me that she would have access to the attacker given that much freedom.
Was a length of rope that was tied between the two wrist.
She was found wearing a sweater fiancee said she would never wear in the summer.
The top button was fastened another inconsistency with a life and death struggle.
The make to one was found in her fiance's dresser the other was under the sofa in the adjacent room under the sofa was a puddle of water tainted with blood the sofa cushions were also wet blood drops on the floor near the so.
In the rafters was a coffee carafe from the kitchen to homicide investigators it looked as if the coffee carafe had been used to rinse blood from the sofa cushions.
The attack occurred near the sofa and the body was later moved into an adjacent room and placed into the barrel of water.
The crime scene staging told investigators that the perpetrator spent a great deal of time inside the house after the murders but who knew that Carla brown was home and the loan on the date of the merger and who would have felt free to spend so much time in the home cleaning up and staging the C..
Police began their investigation with a close look at Carla brown's fiancee.
The autopsy report on Carla brown indicated death by strangulation although she was found nude from the waist down there were no signs of sexual assault.
Investigators were convinced that the killer spent a great deal of time in the house after the merger staging the crime scene.
I didn't know mark very well although they had dated for a number of years off and on and there were times in their relationship that.
It wasn't great but I she seems to always be.
AZ about him anyway police also questioned to neighbors who had been sitting in the yard next door on the day Carla and her fiance removing it.
I'M John Francie we went to school together remember me.
Both men had alibis as to where they were on the day of the murder and they both willingly took lie detector test and passed.
With no other leads police asked the FBI for a psychological profile of the killer and turned to FBI behavioral analyst John Douglas in my restriction began to break down crimes by disorganized and organized disorganized means extra extremely sloppy carelessness on the part of the offender the crime could be very very impulsive organize means that there's a high degree high level of criminal sophistication on the part of the subject to Douglas this crime scene was disorganized an indication that the killer was inexperienced and probably had never killed before he came to the home with no intention of committing murder but did so after some sort of confrontation or rejection.
Since we spend so much time inside the home Douglas believed that he was familiar with the dementor routine and might be living in the neighborhood or very close by.
Douglas said the killer was a non married white male in his mid to late twenties high school educated with a sloppy appearance.
The use of electrical cord to tied the victim's hands indicated the killer had taken shop classes or have vocational training.
Luckless also told investigators that they may have already interviewed the murderer and that he was capable of passing a polygraph test and then it got kind of spooky I mean I was sitting there and I wasn't sure I was believing what he was saying after a certain point he started talking about.
How this individual would react.
And what kind of vehicle he'd be driving.
He started talking about a volts wagon there is high probability this guy I'd be able to drive a Volkswagen.
And that it would be red or orange in color this led investigators to focus once again on the two men sitting next door on the day Carla brown and her fiance removing.
But investigators needed more than just a psychological profile they needed hard.
For one thing he and his colleagues could not determine what caused the.
The first real break in the case occurred when bush attended a seminar on image enhancement at the university of New Mexico Dr Homer Campbell taught that seminar he worked for the state of New Mexico as a medical investigation.
Dr Campbell was demonstrating a photographic technique that uses cameras monitors and computers to show details of crime scene photographs that cannot otherwise be see this is a technique that has been used for several years both by engineers and nondestructive testing of materials and also by archaeologist looking at aerial photographs defined the ancient ruins.
After the seminar bush told doctor Campbell about the Carla brown case and I said Dr do I have a case for you.
And I told them about the color brown case in that.
We were never able to identify what type instrument hadn't damaged her face I asked him to please send me the photographs.
Dr Campbell used his image enhancement equipment to look more closely at the crime scene photos of Carla brown the system not only improves the contrast of the photographs the can also create what appeared to be three dimensional view adding depth to the image when Dr Campbell was through.
Victim where she had probably been on the couch but I missed it.
The tray tables were still in storage untouched in the two years since the merger.
In an extraordinary piece of luck Dr Campbell found microscopic traces of blood and hair still present on the tray table.
And what Dr Campbell said next with even more with the.
This is what about the bite mark.
And a half by Marc Webb by mark what are you talking about.
Present on the shoulder was a bite injury on the show and by looking at that by the injury you could actually pick out individual T. all the way across.
Yeah I tried that for five I would.
As I witness is going to make mistakes things like fingerprints down.
And it was my understanding that bite marks properly preserved with an identified defendant could give you the defendant as good as a fingerprint.
The killer had left behind a slew.
All investigators needed now was a suspect.
Two years after the brutal murder of a twenty two year old karla brown investigators got the break they needed one of photographic enhancement revealed a bite mark on Carly shoulder police now turned to the two men sitting in the yard next door when Carla brown moved into our new home.
Both match the F. B. I.'s behavioral profile of the killer police check their alibis again although both had passed a polygraph test police discovered that John Plantae had spoken about the merger to others Jop Randy had mentioned to his friends that he had seen her body that day that he looked over the shoulder of some policemen while they were investigating in the basement and he described the condition of her body and he even mentioned that she had bite marks on her neck and collarbone.
The police were the only ones inside the house after Carla brown's body was found.
Shock to us as police officers because there's no way that he can and known that unless you put the bite marks there.
Also the information about the location of the body the way the body was found the only way that that would have been known it is either to have been there on the investigation.
or to put the body there yourself because we never released that information to the public or to the media.
Since the bite marks were overlooked during the original autopsy investigators wanted to make sure nothing else was missed so Carla brown's body was exhumed for a second autopsy.
This time it was performed by Dr Mary case the chief medical examiner for St Louis county in the original autopsy there was no ligature strangulation and the body was examined and for some reason they had was not examined and so I opened the cranial cavity and there was bruising in the scalp somebody struck her on the head and question is whether or not for example this alone would cause loss of consciousness.
Dr case thought that Carla brown may have been alive when she was placed in the barrel of water because when she was found it was phone around her mouth because she was in the water in she was producing that phone.
I feel like there may be some component grounding that she was still on even though she'd been strangled she was still maybe to a minimal degree of breathing because I I believe that she may have breathed in some water.
During the autopsy more photographs were taken of the suspected bite wounds which were sent to the New York state police forensic unit for an independent evaluation.
Dr Levine was asked to compare the bite wound to three different dental casts prosecutors sent along for analysis Dr Levine no idea to whom the cast along.
After making wax impressions of the models Dr Levin concluded two of the models were not consistent with the bite wound I took the third model.
And examine the only individual characteristics that those teeth would have cost compared those characteristics with the characteristics on the clarified photograph of Carla brown's neck that I had and came to the opinion that only that model was consistent with having caused of that pattern injury that bite mark he measured the teeth he went back to the photograph he turned in different ways he held them up in the air finally he laid the downward pressures on the table and he pointed to a man he said that year my.
Model number three.
Belonged to John Prine T..
Randy also matched John Douglas's psychological profile he was in his late twenties had a history of troubled relationships with women he attended industrial arts school and had a sloppy on camp appearance.
A great deal of time in the neighborhood often visiting his friend lives next door to Carla brown.
And just as John Douglas had predicted.
He had passed an earlier polygraph test the most unusual aspect of Douglass's profile was the prediction that he would be driving a red Volkswagen.
where that came from the only job I could say but in fact it turned out that the individual did have Volkswagen.
Prosecutors believe that when Carla brown's fiancee left for work John.
The over and knocked on the door maybe we can have you ever for dinner Carlo was talking on the telephone.
When I call you back.
What do you want.
In some kind of argument or struggle possibly after she had rejected twenty sexual advances.
More stir into the basement with the tray tables.
on the shoulder.
He staged the scene to make it appear to be a sexual assault.
Changed for clones he made the mistake.
He tied her hands with electrical.
The socks around her neck.
Please turn into the water while she was unconscious but still alive.
Right to remove the blood stains on the sofa with water carried from the kitchen and the coffee carafe which she left in the rafters above the sub.
In July of nineteen eighty three John twenty was tried and convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to seventy five years in the state penitentiary.
After five long years Carla brown's family finally has some closure I would like to tell him that he he took away a very wonderful person who had a lot to offer an up in a family who cared very much about Carla.
And that it was very.
Very selfish of him to.
To not consider another person's life.
Ana S. as something as something that can just be thrown away.
On a on a particular day.
He got caught because the techniques of investigation and law enforcement completely overpowered him.
He got away with the crime because he was lucky he got caught because law enforcement change this log.
Don Weber along with journalist Charles Bosworth chronicled the many ups and downs of this case and a best selling book silent with.
Carl'S family was so intrigued by the bite mark evidence that she embroidered wool tapestry that she presented to dom Weber as a token of appreciation and it offers the slogan that don had used you can lie through your teeth that your teams don't lie and around the border is the pattern of rectangles space rectangle space triangle which is the bite mark pattern that dont have proved had been made by John printing.
