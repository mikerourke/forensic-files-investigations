A young nurse develops a fatal illness and doctors wonder if she was infected by one of her patients.
For instance scientists genetic researchers and even the police joined together to solve the mystery.
And they discovered this was no accident.
In nineteen ninety four Janet straw Han was a single mother of two young children working as a nurse in the small town of Lafayette Louisiana.
A few years back she started to develop some unusual symptoms and she did what most health professionals do sought the advice of her doctor store it was a.
I mean in my eyes ocular pain movement of my eyes did seek some medical attention for that Mr was probably my sinuses not to worry too much about it.
Genesis added several doctors before she finally saw her gynecologist for a check up.
Suspecting she had a virus or gynecologist ordered a full battery of tests.
When she got the results Janice was both thrilled and devastated.
The dishes not only did she find out she was pregnant but she found out she was HIV positive.
There were several possible explanations for how Janice had been infected with HIV.
Janice worked as a hospital nurse she may have been infected from one of the aids patients there.
Another possibility was a Janis became infected from a previous lover.
Genesis primary care physician at the time Dr Richard Schmidt told colleagues his theory as to how Janice became infected he said Janice is a slut she sleeps around she's in the bars at night.
She goes to bars during the day she goes home with strange men.
And she's most likely contracted the disease from sleeping around.
Knowing her unborn child could be infected with HIV as well Janice decided to end her pregnancy.
Own personal agony.
My prognosis is I know it's in certain I know that HIV is a terminal disease and there is no cure.
All of genesis lovers of the last ten years were asked to undergo HIV testing.
I singly non tested positive for HIV.
But Janice had her own theory as to how she became infected.
It was a series so unbelievable and so fantastic do you believe.
Including the Lafayette police department.
A small town nurse Janice troll Han learned she had been diagnosed HIV positive in January nineteen ninety five.
Five months later she walked into district attorney my Carson's office and told an improbable story about her own doctor Richard Schmidt.
She began relating a story to me how she had had this relationship with doctor Schmidt for a number of years and that she recently found out that she had aids or HIV and she felt that he was responsible for.
While Sorenson was skeptical he told Lafayette police detective Jim craft check out her story was she said that S. O. B..
The story was hard to believe he was running some kind of fire or something he was it a real live doctor with.
Credentials and a bit of background Richard Schmidt was a.
Probably one of the best positions and most respected physicians in this community as forces medical capabilities.
Janice said she first met Dr Schmidt years earlier when they both worked at the same hospital.
This is a new graduate from licensed practical school and I was going through with the orientation face.
New employment at at that hospital.
The first time that I met him.
Janice was married at the time and had a young son.
Dr Schmidt was also married with three children the two struck up a friendship.
What attracted me to Richard was his intelligence a very brilliant Dr.
View him as very very knowledgeable excellent with this patient.
Actually they became romantically involved and started making plans to be together.
Basically his promise to her at that time was that as soon as I'm able I'm going to leave my wife and children and you and I will be married we can be together.
With that promise Janice got a divorce.
Janice did leave her husband for the doctor assuming that the doctor was going to leave his wife and family for her she left hers he never left his.
Jennison Schmidt continued to see one another.
In nineteen ninety one Janice became pregnant and gave birth to their son Jeffrey Schmidt paid child support and continued to promise he'd leave his wife but he never did.
Janice told police she tried to end the relationship many times but said Schmidt made threats against her.
Several times he threatened to put sexually revealing pictures he had taken of her on the hospital bulletin board where she worked.
Another time he threatened to tell the dean of the nursing school that Janice had plagiarized some of our assignments.
She tried to start seeing other men start dating other guys.
The problem was that each time she attempted to establish a relationship outside of their relationship Richard would intervene and that he followed her on dates that she had with the other men even threatened a couple of the guys that she had dated one he threatened to kill pointers home and threatened killer.
And Janice feared for her life words to the effect is if you leave me I'll fix you all fix it so that no man will want you.
She gave him an ultimatum.
She told Richard.
Either leave your wife and marry me our way through.
When Richard fail to respond Janice ended their personal relationship and she stopped using M. S. R. Dr.
Schmidt had been treating her with vitamin B. twelve shots for her lethargy.
According to Janice something strange happened on the evening of August fourth.
Janice was fast asleep when the phone rang between ten and eleven o'clock.
It was doctor Schmidt saying he was coming over right away.
A few minutes later he was standing over her with the syringe injections very painful on write it down more might never had an injection of.
Cause that much pain in my life.
Unlike other visits Janice said Dr Schmidt didn't state talk he left quickly after the injection he was nervous Rasht just.
Are the ordinary.
Janice was convinced that shot which men gave her was contaminated with HIV.
But police weren't so sure.
My mindset was I don't believe this girl this is just her attempt.
To discredit this guy to embarrass him.
To get some books.
To get some money out of.
And even if Janice was right.
How could anyone prove.
Detectives Jim craft wanted to find some way to tell whether Janice strong's incredible story was true.
Her former lover Dr Richard Schmidt had injected her with deadly HIV.
Janice had donated blood just a few months earlier.
Record showed that blood donation was not infected with HIV which meant the infection was recent.
The investigation began by checking Dr Schmitz telephone records.
And justice Janice had told.
Dr Schmidt had called her at ten twenty six PM on August the fourth.
But investigators needed proof that the injection Dr Schmidt gave Janice contained HIV.
Investigators would discover early on in this case that HIV tainted blood is not the easiest thing on earth to obtain you do not just walk into a blood plasma unit or a clinic and say you know give me those three vials of labeled HIV and take them out.
Nurses and doctors from its medical practice kept meticulous records of every patient that had blood drawn for testing.
But if Dr Schmidt took blood from one of his HIV patients the virus wouldn't stay potent for very long you have about a twelve hour window before you have to inject it.
The virus will survive outside the body.
Investigators wanted to see doctor Schmidt's office records for August fourth nineteen ninety four the date Janice said Schmidt and gave her the injection.
Medially we look for the nineteen ninety four book.
But we can't find it it's missing.
Police found the sexually revealing photos he had taken a Janice that he threatened to distribute.
But they still couldn't find his nineteen ninety four office records.
They were about to leave when they discovered a locked storage room full of boxes.
At the very bottom of the pile was a box marked nineteen eighty two records.
In the very bottom of that box was a notebook nothing through it real quickly and it's only halfway full god I don't know fifty sixty pages in it but only about twenty or thirty or more full.
And I look at the last date in the book.
And when you know it it's August fourth nineteen ninety four.
Next to nearly every patient's name would give them blood that day was a sticker with the tracking number on it for the last.
All except one.
Named don McClellan beside his name was a notation that said lavender's stopper for Dr rice.
Police went to see don McClellan and they asked him a very important question are you HIV positive the guy stares at Mrs HIV positive hello I've got full blown aids.
And the Clemons said he never called Dr Schmidt to make an appointment on August fourth he said Dr Schmidt called him to come in for a blood test give this insidious it was beyond diabolical it's one of the strangest cruelest crimes I've ever heard of.
But could the forensic scientists match the strain of HIV and Janice Paul Hahn Dr Schmitz patient.
Prosecutors want to know whether doctor Richard Schmidt took HIV infected blood from one of his patients and injected it into his former lover Janice Strom on.
What there be a way through traditional science or traditional DNA testing to compare those two persons and those two samples are samples from those two people to determine whether they are in fact the the same virus.
They turned to genetic researcher Dr Michael Metzger at Baylor college of medicine in Texas one of the world's most renowned centers of human genome studies.
Dr Metzger told them the DNA test of a virus are not the same as comparing DNA from individuals.
That'S because viruses change or mutate once they enter the body.
But Dr Metzger was willing to conduct an experiment to see if the HIV in genesis body was similar to Dr Schmitz HIV patients don McLoud.
The methods that we use are called phylogenetic methods that invokes it takes advantage of the virus mutability as the virus mutates it involves in different individuals we can use that evolution using mathematical models models to actually trace back relationships between viruses if they exist.
Dr Mr looked at blood samples from thirty individuals infected with HIV in Lafayette Louisiana including the samples from Janice straw Han and don McLean.
He discovered that twenty eight of those samples had mutated in ways that simply different from one another.
But in two of the samples the viruses were nearly identical and were there for closely related.
We looked at the viruses the odds that we found were one in a million of excluding the patient being the source of Janice trots virus.
That for us.
Was corroboration of our theory.
In July of nineteen ninety six Dr Schmid was charged with attempted second degree murder.
But prosecutors were faced with another scientific rental ultimately Janice was diagnosed she was also diagnosed not only HIV positive but with hepatitis C. the patient whose blood been drawn on August fourth was HIV positive but not did not have hepatitis C..
When investigators look again Dr Schmitz medical records they noticed one more patient listed with the old lab sticker next to her name.
That patient had blood drawn two days before Janice's night time injection her blood was never sent to the lab.
That patient's medical record showed she had hepatitis C. the doctor not only.
Here'S to have infected his lover with HIV but.
Combined it with hepatitis C. from eight yet another patient to create this this even more lethal cocktail that he injected with that night.
Dr Smith maintained his innocence he said he had an alibi for the night of August fourth.
He said he was home with his wife except for twenty minutes when she was taking a bath.
But the police officer drove from Dr Schmitz home to genesis and back in about seventeen minutes even allowing time for the injection.
And there's another question.
Why did Dr Schmidt keep his medical records from nineteen ninety four rather than throw them away.
As a trophy he has something from that crime.
That he can look at that he can touch that he could see.
That reminds him that he got away with this.
Along with the scientific and circumstantial evidence it was the words of Janice trough on that echoed in the jury's mind during Dr Schmidt stride which made a lot of promises to me that he did not keep but he did keep one and that would be that he would kill me.
And I feel like that's a death sentence I have.
He did it by injecting the HIV and hepatitis C. tainted blood into genesis arm and did it on the same day the HIV sample making sure maintained its potency.
Despite his medical degree Dr Smith never realized that forensic DNA testing could compare the mutations of the HIV anticipation don McClellan and match them to the HIV and Janice.
What he did was something that's.
Really atrocious when you think about it I mean here's a man who took an oath to preserve people's lives and to do everything he could to to preserve people's lives and in this fashion a basic did everything just the opposite.
On October twenty third nineteen ninety eight he was convicted of attempted second degree murder and sentenced to fifteen years hard labor.
Think about what he was going to do how he was gonna do it.
It was just so diabolical and show even.
Juries like to see to be able to see a smoking gun or the knife or the the baseball bat or whatever it is that the that used to commit the act and in this case we didn't have we didn't have that tangible items but the scientific give us gave us a chance because which is such a ball down to it unfortunate is that these two individuals from whom these samples were drawn were all smoking guns.
Janice Troy Hahn is remarried and lives with their two sons in the same house where she was infected that August night.
I just try to put things in the past and just keep moving forward and.
My outlook on life I think is very good.
I appreciate life more and stop and look at the flowers and treasure each day that I do have with my family and my husband.
This much more meaningful.
This case made forensic history it was the first time in the United States to to HIV cases have been linked using DNA testing in a criminal case the significance of the DNA testing so we we attempted to use something that had not been done before tempted to strike out in our jobs as prosecutors to find a way to prove.
The elements of a crime we use the most advanced tools for understanding the relationship between the DNA sequences from HIV.
But the pretty standard the impact and the contribution was to bring this new methodology into the judicial system and to use it as a tool for investigation of alleged crimes.
