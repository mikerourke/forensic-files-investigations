You'Re twenty one forty five.
One two three when investigators arrived at the scene of the shooting they found the most knowledgeable witness.
The victim's husband is a homicide detective and he said the shooting was an accident.
It took a photograph a forensic scientist own blog and the flexibility of a tendon to solve the mystery.
You are Sonya's Nicolau enjoyed an international.
She was born in Valencia Spain educated in Paris then moved to the United States where she took a job as a nanny in Boston.
She was very culturally knowledgeable she could speak.
The three languages to our native language of violence in Spanish and French fluently and and she loved everything that involves the Spanish or the French competition but then she adopted the American way also very well not long after moving to the United States she met Ted macarthur a Boston area policemen.
He was good to her she fell in love with him.
You know white wine why do you love somebody.
They were very attractive.
The couple married had two children and moved to Miami ten got a job with the local police and quickly rose through the ranks to become a homicide investigator.
My sister would tell me he was very successful in his certificate job he would he resolve the cases here and there and then that everything was going fine and he made a place for himself and the Miami department.
You are got a job in the county's criminal justice system as a corrections officer.
You know inmates can be very vulgar and very very rough she was just so sweet.
But even the inmates could Custer out on August first nineteen eighty nine the macarthur's to children or Boston visiting family.
At eight thirty three AM.
Frantically called police.
Twenty one forty five.
An ambulance arrived a few minutes later.
Ten was performing CPR on PLR but it was no use.
Eight minutes after they arrived medical personnel pronounced people are dead a single gunshot wound to her head.
Don Slavonic headed the investigation you recognize Ted macarthur as a fellow homicide investigator.
I didn't specifically know the man I knew the name I had seen him at a homicide school maybe a year before his reputation was that he was a good investigator.
Ten told his colleagues that his wife jokingly put the gun to her head and pulled the trigger not realizing the gun was loaded.
D. lar was trained in the use of firearms and her family was immediately suspicious.
I don't believe she she was going to do something that stupid.
She had more common sense she was more intelligent than that No way Jose.
You don't play with guns.
And that's the bottom line.
If you're any type of law enforcement person.
Thirty five year old corrections officer PR macarthur was dead from a single gunshot.
Her husband Thomas site investigator Ted macarthur was brought in for questioning please register menu we're about to get on with the truth the whole truth and nothing but the clothes shopping that.
He said he went into the bathroom to refill the water pistols and when he returned he saw P. lark jokingly holding his police revolver to her head.
And she said don't worry it's not.
Media please call nine one one then put on the floor and began CPR.
At the scene police found the water pistol ten referred to.
The bullet wound was on the left side of the large head supporting Ted's account of what happened there was only one empty cartridge in the gun's chamber five on spent shells were on the night stand meaning it was possible PMR thought she'd emptied the gun and didn't realize it was still loading.
And investigators tested Ted's hands for gun powder residue which would have been president had he fired the gun.
Those tests were negative.
But Slimani was to experience to merely accept the word of a fellow officer when he spoke to the couple's friends relatives and co workers Slavonic learned there were problems in their marriage.
There was a few people that had good things to say about him but most most of the people that I spoke with didn't share a very good opinion about him he wasn't overly personable man.
NPR told friends that her husband was spending money faster than they could make.
And she was telling me you know he's withdrawing.
Two three hundred dollars at a time and I don't know where this money's going there were times several months before her death she would go and write a check for groceries.
Not realizing that he had taken all the money on the check bounced.
She saw the reason for his extravagance.
Was a picture of a woman sitting on a bed with a little ninety on.
He said so what happened and she says you know I asked some and he said it was just a case.
The PMR worked in law enforcement and knew the numbers written on the back of the photographs were not case number.
So that's when she decided she was going to investigate herself and should hide somebody she decided to do it herself and she started to go places and I.
One day she's in a bar and she saw him.
With with the latest picture.
I asked him in the interview if he was dating anyone he initially denied and then he said yes he was dating a lady.
And he didn't want to give her name and I go you don't understand this is an open for debate who was a lady and I want to name right now.
Ted identified his girlfriend as the crime reporter from the Miami Herald newspaper.
To save their marriage had promised to end the affair.
For her part you are did everything she could to make her marriage work.
She was making an effort on her part to really win back and really.
Kindle the relationship and part of that was of course as with any relationship you know.
By changing your style of clothing to include you know the ninety lingerie and stuff like that.
Thomas P. Laur he would buy her a thirty thousand dollar luxury car and made a deposit on a new home.
A few days before the large desk had arranged a romantic evening for his wife he led candles drew a bag and brought a television into the bathroom so PMR could watch your favorite programs while relaxing in the top.
And he put the TV up and then he said oh I I forgot some.
And on his way out of the bathroom he accidentally brushed against the television and it fell into the water.
Fearing she would be electrocuted people are frantically check the TV out of the water.
He explained it as an accident and.
You know said he was sorry and it was nothing but an accident and I said to please.
And he said she said yeah.
This alleged accident just five days before people are suspicious death was quite a coincidence.
Investigators asked forensic scientist Dr Henry Lee to examine PLR McArthur's bed room in an effort to determine.
What really happened on the day of her death.
The first thing he noticed was that P. large hands completely please.
Her hand should have some high velocity impact spatter because when you pull a trigger.
And ten told investigators that he moved P. large body to the floor immediately to perform CPR after the shooting.
But doctor Lee's saw something suspicious.
Here to be too much blood on the pillow.
By weighing the dried blood doctor Lee determined the P. Lara lost one third of her blood volume from one thousand to two thousand C. C.'s Wilder head was on the hello.
One to two thousand CC open that's quite a bit of both.
Since only one.
From that volume doctor Lee estimated PLR had been on the bed for about fifteen minutes before Ted moved her to the floor.
This contradicted ten story the move PLR to the floor immediately after the gunshot.
Does that make sense.
To leave then read the statement of the policemen who arrived at the shooting scene within a minute of the nine one one call.
He said that the blood on the bed had already coagulated.
When blood coagulate the serum which is clear separates from the cells and platelets which are red.
The blood smear on the bad created when Ted moved his wife to the floor showed clearly the serum had separated from the sounds this meant that P. Lars body had been moved after the blood coagulated.
To find out how long it takes human blood to regulate doctor Lee drew five hundred CC's of his own blood for an experiment.
You can use red cross blood those are.
Room temperature took fifteen to twenty minutes for doctor Lee's blood to coagulate or separate into its components proving that the law had been dead fifteen to twenty minutes before the paramedics arrived.
The body was moved right away we should see a Buell bless me.
But it didn't prove that PMR was murdered.
That information would come from ballistics expert Dr Vincent Tamayo chief medical examiner in bare county Texas.
The first thing he saw was that the wound was on the left side of his head yet people are was right handed.
Can'T say just based on that but he was alive but that she used to left hand.
Maybe you should look a little harder on this case that you would normally Dr Tamayo knew the exact position of the gun because he could see the outline of the guns site on our skin.
It was a contact wound.
And imprinted on the skin was the imprint of the muzzle of the gun so but I knew how the muzzle of the gun was oriented.
When he placed the gun in the same position with the correct angle of the bullets downward trajectory he discovered something interesting.
Let me demonstrate if we sweep up this way.
And then would have to turn it this way.
The problem is is the way your hand is twisted the tendons are pulled and you cannot.
The track at the matter how hard we try call us.
That ruled out an accident or suicide.
Someone else must have fired the gun.
The only other person in the bedroom that morning was Ted macarthur.
In fact the gun was held against her hand.
To solve this case.
Based on this account and based on the findings I don't what Taapsee it was obvious he was online.
Ted McArthur went before the public to proclaim his innocence I face the death penalty in this case I was offered a plea early on in this case I wouldn't plead to making an illegal left turn connection in this case I did absolutely nothing wrong.
Soon it would be up to a jury to decide.
Ted macarthur claimed that his wife put a gun to her head as a joke and that it accidentally went off and killed her.
There are not real homicides in Dade County that occur on a regular basis than to try to take an accidental death for whatever the reasons are and to turn it around and to do this.
Prosecutors believe it was cold blooded murder and the tents motive was money.
The couple's bank records revealed Ted was spending lavishly on his mistress he couldn't afford a new house and car.
He never was going to buy the house you can afford it.
He wasn't gonna buy the car because he couldn't afford it all these other issues were simply a show to make his wife I think that he was trying to save their marriage.
And Ted took out a two hundred fifty thousand dollar life insurance policy on P. law.
Five weeks before she was murdered that is suspicious.
Added to existing policies texted to collect four hundred seventy thousand dollars if PMR died accidentally.
To solve his money problems and his marriage and start a new life with this mistress prosecutors believe Ted killed his wife and tried to make it look like an accident.
He gets money he is a recipient of sympathy he has a glowing reputation no one's going to question him almost four years after P. large death Ted McArthur was charged with first degree murder.
During the trial a relaxed confident macarthur stuck to his story the PMR was joking around when she accidentally shot herself.
No it's not and at that point my feelings are that the gun was coming away from my head.
And it just.
The forensic evidence showed otherwise.
Prosecutors believe the PMR was probably sleeping on her right side when fired the bullets and two were left ten.
He took the remaining bullets with the gun and put them on the night stand white the gun to remove his prince and washed his hands to remove the gun powder residue.
About fifteen minutes.
In this way.
Macarthur made the mistake of shooting people are on the wrong side of the head and she was right handed and he could offer no explanation why the large hands were clean and fingerprints were missing from the gun all.
Tale signs of Ted's deception.
Even though he was an experienced homicide detective McArthur was unable to stage the perfect crime.
What happened is they got a very detailed.
Explanation of what happened so he could change his story and they recorded.
He in turn didn't realize the significance of the statement he was giving he didn't realize that there was going to be a muscle.
A jury found.
Guilty of first degree murder he was sentenced to life in prison.
He thought he could get away with murdering his wife he thought people with the least.
He was wrong.
His wife is dead but he's paying the price.
