A suspicious fire swept through an apartment killing two young women the cause of the fire and the identity of the victims were unclear.
A closer look at the fire scene revealed something hidden in the actions could gas chromatography of burned pair of eye glasses and a half smoked cigarette solve the case.
On a spring night in March of nineteen ninety nine.
Firefighters in Iowa city rushed to an apartment building in flames near the university of Iowa campus.
When they arrived they had that fire blowing out windows and doors of the apartment building.
We had the opportunity and the necessity to initiate an aggressive fire attack.
Just inside the entrance.
Firefighters found what appeared to be a body.
Then in the back bedroom another gruesome discovery.
They were unable to see and so I had to use the just feeling their way around the apartment and checking on the bad they found the second victim.
A driver's license found next to one of the bodies belonged to twenty nine year old Laura walks and Dalton.
Paramedic would come to Iowa city to visit her costs and.
She had really love the town and it was St Patrick's day that was one of her favorite holidays and I think because it's a college town sort of from the great party atmosphere for Saint Patrick's day she decided to go there and visit friends.
The second victim matched the description of a woman who had been reported missing.
She was twenty seven year old Maria Elena an environmental scientist who was in town on a business trip and was staying at a nearby hotel.
Back of our minds we kinda knew what was they had found her blazer in a parking ramp and it hadn't been.
The apartment was rented to three college students who claimed they were out of town on the night of the fire.
The man said they gave no one permission to stay there they also denied knowing either Laura Watson or Maria Elena.
At the morgue the medical examiner found evidence that the women were dead before the fire started.
There was no such in the lungs of either victim therefore we're able to conclude scientifically that they expired prior to the fire.
It was evident they had both been.
Killed by blunt force trauma to the head.
Inside the apartment investigators found a barbell that contained blood and human hair leading to speculation this was the murder weapon.
They also found gasoline container you might find gasoline cans stored of course in the garage or utility closets but to find a gasoline can in our hallway of an apartment.
It'S that's that would be rather odd.
Investigators believed that the fire may have been intentionally set in that close to the killer's identity could be waiting at the crime scene hidden in the smoldering ashes.
And they also wondered why these two women were in an apartment rented by man they've never even met.
The lack of salt and smoke in the victim's lungs revealed that the two women were killed before the fire started.
And when the medical examiner compared the amount of tissue damage between the two victims he discovered something astonishing.
The two victims were killed on different days.
It is clear that Laura died in the late hours on Wednesday or the early morning hours on Thursday and remained in that apartment or she died and then Maria died late Thursday night or early Friday morning in the same apartment.
Laura Watson's friends told police that they last saw her in a local bar on Wednesday night two nights before the fire.
Laura was talking to a man sitting beside her.
Can someone you've had a conversation with it's been kind of interesting asks you if you'd like to you know go to another party or or go to another bar lots of people of I've done that and it's a situation where most of us don't think that we're gonna place ourselves in peril.
Witnesses said Laura left with the man around midnight.
He was described as tall in his twenties with uncapped brown hair and glasses.
Investigators discovered the same thing happened to Maria Elena on the following.
The owner of a different bar said he saw Maria leaving his establishment with a man matching the same description.
She didn't have as good as judgmental she would have it she wasn't drinking maybe he said he there's a party over at this place you want to come with me I don't think she ever did it before I think this is one time and it was in.
It was the wrong time.
Since the victims had been murdered on two different nights the killer apparently had free access to the apartment a good calm and go as you please.
But the college students who rented it said they had no idea who the killer wives.
After the last embers were out the Iowa department of criminal investigations examined the scene for clues.
Investigators noticed a hole in the outside wall of the apartment and there was a gas container found just inside the front door.
To see if an accelerated had been used investigators places some of the debris into air tight container and sent it to the lab for analysis.
The files were placed in the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer for analysis and all separated out based on the physical properties and chemical properties of the components of what ignited a liquid may be in that sample and everything flows through the instrument at a different rate and it'll actually separate out those you'll see the individual components of each component of the innate ability with the results were clear.
Gasoline had been used to start the fire.
Currently the gasoline vapors ignited causing the explosion that blew through the outside wall.
Investigators also discovered a matchbook in the debris.
The gasoline had to be ignited by something and so when the fire marshal.
Collected a matchbook.
In around that fire St that was really a fresh.
Matchbook with only one match missing.
The fire had destroyed any prints that might have been on the matchbook.
Stephen Duffy look through all of the photos taken at the fire scene searching for items that may have been overlooked.
In one of the photographs he noticed something that looked like a pair of eyeglasses.
When he returned to the apartment they were still there.
They were very obviously prescription eye glasses and I hoped that I could.
Go back through those prescriptions to find the owners.
None of the tenants are victims owned the glasses.
Duffy also found a cigarette but still very much intact.
The cigarettes have been smoked.
I had not been put out had not been stomped out on the floor.
In other words it was still burning when it hit the cop.
Investigators suspected that the perpetrator lit a cigarette then started the poor the gasoline throughout the apartment.
At some point his cigarette probably ignited the gases.
He received a burn on his nails either swatted at his face and knocked his glasses off or he the glasses fell off the space.
Now investigators were looking for a call on the man who smokes cigarettes and possibly had a burnt face you may also have been missing his eyeglasses.
One week after a fire gutted their apartment the three college students who rented it were allowed to return.
There were items stolen from the apartment that included a VCR or two and some other electronic equipment.
Investigators check local pawn shops to see if someone had sold the stolen goods.
And they got their first break.
One shop owner recalled buying these items from a young man just a few days earlier.
In Iowa anyone selling to a pawn shop must show some form of identification with an address.
The man who sold the items was John member twenty three year old drifter known around town as a party.
John member was very adept at inviting himself to those after hours parties.
Not because of that.
Person who con is way into staying over at any number of apartments and sleeping on a couch or what have you.
One of the apartment tenants said he knew members and had let him sleep overnight a few weeks earlier.
He didn't have a lot of friends who didn't have a job you wasn't it rolled as a student he was sleeping where he could he was very transient and yes that made it more difficult to find Mr memory basically made his living by being at the police finally caught up with member who was on probation at the time for a forgery conviction.
When he was questioned investigators noticed he had a burn injury on his nose.
Member admitted he had been in the apartments while the tenants were away and also confessed to stealing their stereo and television set but he denied killing the women for setting the fire.
He said there was another drifter sleeping in the apartment that we to.
Police wanted to see if they could tie member to the evidence.
The laughter the fire explosion he did not have eyeglasses and during the following week.
Where another pair of glasses.
Using a machine called a lens on an optometrist determined the degree of curvature or diopters of the lenses.
The strength of the lenses match the prescription member had been given by his side Dr.
In John member situation he needed his eye glasses to see.
He would not leave his eyeglasses laying around self defined as I. classes at the scene of a double homicide.
Lisa needed more proof.
They looked once again at the cigarette.
The one investigators suspected had inadvertently ignited the fire.
Was it possible.
This cigarette box contained the killer's DNA.
Scientists removed the rapper from the live band of the cigarette then separated any cells present in the paper.
The biological sample was St reproduced to create a larger sample for analysis then compared to a DNA sample taken from member while in custody.
It was a match.
So just to clean the the chances of the DNA and the cigarette butt coming from anyone but Mr.
Two small to consider the memory it melted being in the apartment which could account for him leaving his glasses and the cigarette by.
Police needed more proof.
Investigators then examined Laura Dalton's letter jacket found in the apartment.
Somebody came up and said you know well we have this jacket why don't you go ahead and look at the jacket maybe as a print on a button a snap or something.
Criminalist Bassman check the jacket under a high intensity light no prints were found.
Then he placed a jacket in a special cabinet with a small container of cyanoacrylate a compound found in super glue.
The compound was heated and the fumes circulated around the jacket for about ten minutes.
Cyanoacrylates made kind of a little fibers network over those fumes and we can look at it it makes the ridges stand out white instead of black like its scenic fingerprint card.
To his surprise.
The prince was died for rest under forensic lighting.
Best man compared that to the soles on the shoes confiscated from John member when he was taken into custody.
Both prints were the same size and make there had been a contaminant on issue or something on the coast of the shoe removed when it made contact with it so it was a rather unusual to develop a footwear impression this way.
And there was something else on the issue.
A tiny piece of evidence that would tell investigators exactly what happened to Laura Dalton and Maria Elena.
Investigators found one last piece of evidence linking John member to the murders of Laura Watson Dalton and Maria Elena.
It was a tiny piece of material on member shoes.
On the side of the soul about the size of a pinhead kind of a reddish brown stain I believe might have been blood.
The stain was lifted using sterile water then tested using DNA analysis.
It just made it just more sad because.
You kind of knew what he had to do.
That was critical it showed that John memory.
I had been in contact with Maria Elena even though he denied it and that at some point he was with Maria later when she was bleeding.
John member was charged with first degree murder.
We had other forensic evidence of the Jack at the footwear analysis the eye glasses but it was the DNA analysis that found Maria's blog on member shoe that was the final straw that let us go forward.
Prosecutors believe John member broke into the apartment when he knew the tenants were out of town.
How he lowered Laura Dalton to the apartment on Wednesday evening isn't clear but prosecutors believe member may have made a sexual advance which was rejected.
In a rage.
Killed Laura with a blow to the head.
On Thursday night.
Member probably lowered Maria Elena to the apartment the same way and when she too rejected him.
Hold her as well.
On Friday after stealing the television and stereo member decided to destroy all possible evidence that he had been there.
He led a single match for a cigarette and then set about the process of pouring gasoline throughout the apartment but he made a mistake.
The gasoline cost fumes to build in the small apartment.
And his cigarette because the explosion.
It knocked his glasses off burned his nose and the cigarette butt in matches went flying.
That was probably John members down from just smoking a cigarette because you left behind valuable evidence.
And nearly killed himself the waste.
Is a waste of human being.
I don't think probably never contributed anything.
And as a probably has spent all his life using people in and taking.
A back at the trial it wasn't just the forensic evidence that made an impression on the jury.
Member was sporting a new tattoo as he sat at the defense table.
In the gaming world.
I tend to drop signifies you've murdered someone.
In this case that was significant because John member did not want one tear drop at the corner sign that he wanted to.
Not very smart.
Going to the trial with those on his side the jury can see it easily.
I when I questioned him about that at trial he claimed they were for two friends of his that had died in an automobile accident but I think that was pretty powerful damning evidence in truth in the aggregate it was a small piece of circumstantial evidence but it was an interesting addition to the totality of.
John member was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.
The real Lehner's family says it's ironic that science helps find her killer.
She was a biology major she loves science so knowing that.
The blood on the issue and all the other forensic evidence was what put him away I'm sure she would would have thought that was pretty cool.
There is no such thing as a perfect crime there's always evidence left it's there for the people who look this was where the evidence leads and it pointed to Mr member.
He received two life sentences John member well obviously serve one of his life sentences here on this earth.
If I was John member I would be worried about where I'm going to spend at second life sentence.
It it may be a lot hotter there than.
