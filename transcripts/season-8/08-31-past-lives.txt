Well see American executive was found dead in his car in Mexico.
It looks like an accident until a forensic anthropologist found evidence of a chilling tale of fraud and deceit.
Thirty four year old Madison Rutherford had everything he was ambitious successful happily married and rich.
He worked as a financial adviser in Connecticut with an uncanny ability to make money for his clients he also managed money for his friends like Brigada back I thought since I am alone in this country I thought it might be wise if anything would happen to me I thought I should have him as my executor.
By all accounts Madison Rutherford and his wife friend he lives lavishly and had expensive tastes.
So it wasn't unusual for Madison to travel outside the United States pursuing his various interests.
Madison Rutherford and his wife had a penchant for various types of of animals including dogs and part of the reason for supposedly going to Mexico was to obtain another exotic dog.
But a few days later Mexican police found Rutherford's car in a ravine near Monterey.
It appeared that the car had swerved off the road and caught fire.
When they got there the car was burnt beyond recognition everything was gone and he opened up the driver door and found some bone fragments on the driver side.
Inside investigators found a medical alert pendant and a wrist watch.
On the back of the watch barely legible was the inscription to Madison love Rennie.
Also inside the car the charred remains of a human all that was left was some bones and teeth the cause of death was listed as total carbonization meaning that just disintegrated from the heat.
When Rutherford's wife friend he got the news she was devastated.
As I came into the house everybody was very long faces and sad and I was at my goodness what happened and this one person tells me that it was something terrible happened last night next man Madison had an automobile accident and he got killed huh I thought this was just this was just awful in October my goodness how terrible.
Fortuitously Rennie said she could help investigators with the identification of her husband.
She proceeds to tell the insurance carriers that she has one of Rutherford's teeth that was left over from ties some type of dental work.
The two staff was extremely helpful since it's hard enamel shell often protects its inner core in a fire.
That core contains an individual's DNA.
But one of the forensic scientists in Mexico was suspicious particularly when he examined the items recovered from the car.
The clasp of the medical alert bracelet was found in the open position he thought that very odd if somebody had died and that bracelet was on them it would have been in the class position.
Investigators wondered whether the open class was a clue or simply an unimportant details.
Although there were some inconsistencies in the accident scene.
The Mexican authorities ruled that Madison Rutherford had burned to death in a car accident.
Mexico wasn't pursuing this there was no complaint they had a a body and a tragic death and they have closed the case.
As a financial planner Madison Russell project planned for his family's future in the event of his death he had purchased an ample amount of life insurance.
Rougher had two separate policies but with two separate companies is doubly insured he's insured for seven million dollars four million from one company and three million from another company.
As a routine matter insurance companies like to make sure that a person who dies in a fire is in fact their client.
The two given to them by Rutherford's wife could be used for DNA comparison but it wasn't enough.
So they sent the charred remains from the accident to one of the most respected forensic anthropologist in the world Dr William bass.
The best bone evidence was a small skull fragment and forties.
Dr best found something highly unusual about the skull fragment.
The top outside of the skull wasn't burned.
Well I got a lot of problems with.
If you're sitting in your car is on fire.
The top of your skull is going to burn.
It'S comparable pieces the size of a quarter.
Here'S a situation which this doesn't happen.
Dr bass concluded there was only one way this could have happened.
The victims had had to be on the floor of the car at the time of the fire.
This tells me then that this is a stage see.
That this is not what happened.
In the normal crash of a car this is a body that has been placed in there in a position that was not even before.
The skull fragment also provided clues about the victim's age.
The human skull has twenty eight different played like bones these phones come together in a process called fusion where they meet often looks like the stitching on clothes.
As a person grows older that's stitching or fusion tends to disappear.
In this case it was almost non existent.
It tells me that this is not a thirty four year old individual.
That this is an individual.
Maybe twice that.
Certainly fifty plus because you don't normally.
Get that much fusion and a thirty four year old white male.
The teeth also told a story.
Sometimes different races have different shaped teeth the ones recovered from the car had shovel shaped incisors not something associated with the white or Caucasian person.
These teeth had characteristics that are very specific to mongoloid the Japanese Chinese or American Indian.
Characteristics please or call mongoloid characteristics.
In addition the teachers had large unfilled cavities.
Inconsistent with the wealthy man with access to the best and dental care.
The good doctor bass inform the insurance companies of his findings.
I was told that the individual whose car it was a thirty four year old white male.
When I get through the analysis of the skill remains that's not what I see what is in that car is a fifty to sixty plus year old Mexican pension who has fought for more more socioeconomic level obviously be present but had done manual labor.
There were even more reasons to be skeptical and more evidence that the scene might have been staged.
Insurance investigators look more closely at the medical alert pendant and the watch found in the ashes.
If the body had burned almost to ashes why did these items remained relatively intact.
And witnesses said they saw a bicycle on the back of Rutherford's car earlier in the day no bicycle was found at the accident site.
If it wasn't Madison roster for it in the car who was it.
The rent check scientists were certain that Madison Rutherford was not the man killed in the car explosion in Mexico the focus switched not so much from we need more proof of death we actually think he's alive and now we want to find out where.
The authorities weren't the only ones concerned his neighbor Brigada back had entrusted Madison Rutherford with her entire life savings about half a million dollars and she wanted to know where it was I was uncomfortable about the whole thing I said well how is this going to play out where and when will I get my money when do I get what what do I have a clear picture of this whole thing.
She you know is it just I need to speak with you and just don't make a sound please don't make a sound don't say anything on us what could put its happening so she leaned over kind of and she was but he said that.
Where is he and she said he's in hiding.
I just lost it I just thought this was just too much I just walked away after a few moments and I just cried I just I just broke down a bit this was too much.
Four Brigada things soon got even stranger when Madison Rutherford showed up alive and well at her house.
This was all very bizarre and how could he do that in the nineteen be afraid that he might get picked up but somebody might get much to house.
Rutherford told Brigada that his death had been stage for him by none other than the FBI.
He said that organized crime members were after him because he had refused to launder drug money.
He assured Brigada that her money was safe but instructed her to tell no one he was alive.
He asked me would you mind if I could spend a couple of weeks with you until I find what I need to do next I said of course I mean the poor guy had to be hiding from the mob I would not help somebody.
Without warning medicine left bracket is home and she never heard from him again.
A few weeks later Brigada got another visit this time from the FBI.
Their investigation into Madison roster for its financial dealings revealed he had withdrawn brick at his entire life savings.
The agent said there is no money and I thought maybe they made a mistake this this cannot be and I realized I had nothing left he had dismantled everything was a little by little.
And I said my god what do I have in my pocket.
I had exactly five hundred dollars in my checking account.
Investigators had Rutherford's home under surveillance Madison never appeared but they finally got a break.
Check the motor vehicles revealed that Madison owned the car that was being driven by a businessman in Massachusetts.
His name was Thomas bay Hamilton.
He works as a controller for a technology company it's a fairly small company in downtown Boston.
As investigators were about to question Thomas bay Hamilton they got a call from Mexican authorities.
They said they found a bag full of bloody clothes and DNA tests concluded the plot was Madison right to for.
One year after Madison wrote the fridge disappearance Mexican police found a bag full of bloody clothing near the side of his car fire.
The clothing showed numerous knife holes all over the chest area.
D. N. A. test of that blood confirmed it belonged to Madison run different.
But this time investigators didn't believe it.
They were convinced the man they were following in Boston Thomas bay Hamilton was in fact Madison Rutherford.
The FBI searched his apartment and found books on how to change your identity and travel brochures on Mexico.
And they found one item that appeared to tie up the case once and for all.
The Boston apartment we find an actual to do list it says goals for the year nineteen ninety nine slash two thousand and the very top thing is collect seven million dollars from the insurance company so that was pretty good quote.
We we we kind of tied in together with just that one piece of paper.
Right after he was arrested Rutherford called his wife from prison this call maybe recorded or monitored the first thing is we have to keep you from getting picked up anything they think you did what you did.
Okay you got to go somewhere where they don't know the address of the forget tomorrow morning they'll get it they'll get an arrest warrant by them what happens every time I don't know let's do this piece by piece.
Rennie originally denied she had anything to do with the attempted fraud.
But when investigators showed her evidence that her husband was dating other women while living in Boston Rennie changed her mind.
She was not happy she went through a range of emotions so.
And ending with with anger.
Securus learned that they had been planning this crime for months.
While Madison was in Mexico he drove to a desolate graveyard in the Mexican countryside and removed the body.
Currently he found a cemetery in Mexico near to where the crash I was went in to an above ground tombs took off the top of the casket and took out the corpse out of the casket.
Prosecutors believe he positioned his car with the body inside at the bottom of the ravine.
Doused it with gasoline.
And started the fire.
When the flames subsided he threw in his medical alert bracelet and watch so they would survive the blaze can help identify the court.
He then took off on his bicycle.
Rutherford returned to the United States and gave his wife the tools he removed from the body so it could be used for possible DNA testing.
According to his wife he walks in I believe with these things in a bag and and says to her here's S. my seven million dollar to.
To this day no one knows whose bones were inside the car.
Later when Rutherford learned investigators were on to him he was forced to change his plans.
According to Rennie her husband got into the bathtub fully closed and cut himself to make it appear that he had been stabbed then he returned to Mexico to plant the evidence.
Rutherford never realized that forensic anthropology would uncover the true position of the body in the car and that the bones would reveal the man's race and age.
Addison Russ for thought of every detail but he never thought of the bone doctor.
Investigators looking for a motive soon discovered that Rutherford had gambled heavily in stocks and lost.
Yes so I'm self as a financial guru and he tried to play the stock market as a day trader he lost a considerable amount of money in the nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six period and I think that he saw that faking his death and getting insurance proceeds was a way of recouping losses and providing himself with a nest egg for future investments.
Investigators learned that Rutherford used a number of aliases in the past all were presidential sounding names Madison Rutherford and now Hamilton.
His real name was John Sankey I thought it was ironic it's quite humorous that he was arrested on election day on November seventh two thousand sorry this man with all these presidential sounding names didn't get a chance to vote for the next president people think that the FBI doesn't have a sense of humor but I think this proves that we do.
When faced with the evidence against him Madison Rutherford pleaded guilty to fraud.
Federal sentencing guidelines limit his sentence to five years.
His wife running was sentenced to eighteen months in prison for her part in the attempted fraud.
Since Rutherford had withdrawn half a million dollars from Brigada backs accounts she has nothing left.
She confronted him during a telephone conversation while he was in prison.
Can I ask.
let's talk next week.
Only because I can't do anything that let's talk next week.
You know I want to know your name okay.
Okay let's talk next week.
He couldn't care less my my wonderful friend turned into it turned into a monster to me and I hope that anybody that find themselves in the same or similar situation be careful of strip called friends.
No criminal charges could be brought against Rutherford for embezzlement since brigade had given him power of attorney.
For investigators Rutherford was clever but clearly no match for forensic science.
This is one of the better cases.
That we have been able to solve from the use of science they were able to show that actually feels.
Do not fit the story that we were told there's an old adage that goes something like you're only as smart as you are educated and clearly Madison Ross fit as well educated as you might have been was not educated the Air France.
