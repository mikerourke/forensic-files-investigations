The murder of a prominent businessman in Colorado was particularly difficult to solve since the killers left virtually no forensic evidence at the scene.
But information is gathered from a small town diner an endocrinologist and the forensic botanist took a bite out of the chief suspect's alibi.
An elevation of seven thousand feet steamboat springs Colorado boasts one of the largest ski mountains in North America.
Lifetime resident Jerry Boggs found the splendor of the small town ski resort inescapable.
The family business Boggs hardware had been on main street for sixty three years.
Jerry was the kind of person that everybody thought he was their best friend he was a great guy people love them he was kind generous you could trust him with your life.
On October twenty second nineteen ninety three box didn't show up for work as he usually did.
Jerry'S brother went to his home.
And found him dead inside the back door.
He had been shot to death nearby was a plastic bag and a bloody shuffles.
It appeared that he had been ambushed.
civil was hitting him in the head with a shovel and.
Boggs often kept his doors unlocked but there were no valuables missing.
Investigators could find no foot impressions foreign hairs or fibers.
We didn't have any direct evidence we didn't have any fingerprints any DNA anything that directly connected anyone to the crime scene.
A neighbor reported seeing two suspicious looking man near Boggs home on the day of the murder.
And police had another suspect Jerry Boggs ex wife Jill quite the two got married when Jill became pregnant with Gary's baby.
I don't think he was in love with her I think that she tricked him and into getting married.
The marriage lasted for only seven days Jerry had the marriage annulled when he learned that Jill had gotten a divorce from her previous husband couldn't figure out what in the world who's doing with this woman because in one hour I could tell that she was just off the wall absolutely the strangest person and not at all suited for Jerry.
After the announcement to barely spoke.
And she would come to steamboat and she would call up people that Jerry knew talk about the child and how jury had thrown them out and he was a horrible person.
When questioned Joe said she had an alibi for the night of Jerry's murder she said she was camping at the Putra national park a hundred fifty miles away.
Her new boyfriend Michael Backus corroborated her alibi.
Investigators were left to wonder.
The autopsy revealed the jury box had been beaten with a shovel and shot three times in the chest with a twenty five caliber pistol.
Investigators closely analyzed the shovel for clues.
The shuttle itself was very old and the wood was very porous our lab people concluded that whoever was using it was probably wearing gloves is there a bloody hand prints on it and you could see her fingers had banned but there was no rich detail with which to make identification.
In addition to the head injuries and bullet wounds.
There were some other injuries that experts couldn't explain.
Based on body temperature and rigor mortis methods that are crude and sometimes inaccurate the medical examiner estimated the dogs died sometime the night before his body was found.
Police had two leads.
A neighbor reported seeing two men near Barnes home earlier in the afternoon on the day.
Was also a suspect she and Boggs had been fighting over a one hundred thousand dollar loan box made to Jill's bed and breakfast hotel during their brief marriage.
It was an embarrassment to you know you live in a small town you know all these people you get married you've never been married before you get married and all of a sudden you've you've got this.
Can O. worms to deal with that was just so much it was just horrible for him I'm sure I'm sure at times you probably just want to crawl under the rug.
Jill had an alibi for the night of the murder investigators wanted to make sure Barnes was killed at night and not earlier in the day.
For a better estimate of the time of death Dr Dover St decided to analyze the undigested food in dog's stomach.
So if we could find out where he ate and at what time he ate we could really narrow down the time of death.
In retracing Bob steps on the day of the murder investigators learned the jury opened a hardware store at ten o'clock as he did every morning.
He works for a while then walked two doors down to the shack for breakfast.
There he ordered the same meal he always did a toast and hash brown potatoes.
The folks in the cafe said oh yeah he stopped by here and had his usual to see if breakfast was box last meal investigators turned to a scientist at the university of Colorado.
We'Ve done the same thing with woolly mammoths frozen in the ice in Siberia and Alaska identified what plants they were eating.
David Norris an endocrinologist at the university of Colorado and his colleague forensic botanist James Bach were asked to examine box stomach contents.
Basically humans consume between fifty and seventy five different types of plants in their diet.
Plants are easier to distinguish in the stomach than animal products.
The cell walls themselves remain intact they'll pass internally through the digestive system this makes to the dedication quite easy doesn't make any difference whether the material was frozen whether it was boiled.
It will remain virtually indestructible.
Dr Norris placed a sample of bogs stomach contents on a slide.
Under his microscope doctor Norris saw a jumble of the regular hexagons.
He recognized them as the intact cells of either a potato or apple both had nearly identical cell structures.
To determine which one doctor Norris used potassium iodide test for the presence of starch a drop of it is added to the material on the slide and if starches present it will turn black.
Under the microscope.
The cells turned black which confirm the presence of starch the sales were from potatoes.
Since Jerry eight hash Browns on the day he was murdered the presence of potatoes seem to indicate breakfast was his last meal.
Or was it.
In addition to the potato sales I also saw sells of onions and these are relatively easy to identify because of the brick like shape of the cells and the way they're put together kind of like looking at a brick wall.
The short order cook at the diner insisted he never put on units in the X. or the hash brown potatoes.
So we thought.
This is this is a worried maybe he did have another later meals.
Another meal manta Boggs was killed after dinner.
The prime suspect his ex wife Jill quite had an airtight alibi for that night.
The only other suspects were the two men seen near Boggs home whom police have not yet identified.
The mysterious murder of Jerry Boggs baffled police and the quiet resort town of steamboat springs Colorado.
Investigators found evidence that bogs grew suspicious of his ex wife after the annulment when he caught her lying about her date of birth.
Boggs hired his friend Judy prior Lewis a private investigator to look into gill's background.
And what she uncovered was shocking she learned that Jill lied about her pregnancy with Jerry's baby she hadn't been pregnant at all she had a hysterectomy years earlier she claimed to have a child and we were all telling him there is no child.
He he still believed it he he just couldn't accept it he would come down to our house and I would just try every thing I knew to convince him that there really was no baby.
Jones a former model and beauty queen would lie to Jerry about her background and the number of time she was married.
Derose matched Kirsty Lee Boggs Carol have been married nearly a dozen times I don't smoke or drink I guess my greatest sin is that I get married Jill had married and divorced another man after Jerry and was about to walk down the aisles yet again to her new boyfriend Michael back to us.
What was so funny was deals third husband William quite had been murdered twenty years earlier with the same caliber weapon that killed Jerry Boggs William cleats murder was unsolved.
Circumstances were very similar in that both jury bugs and William court were preparing to take her to court they were within a week court date there with with within a week of a court date where her character was going to be expelled and bogs private investigators found evidence that jail falsely claimed to be pregnant in other marriages presumably for financial purposes.
Mr Boggs I think was at the point of disclosing to the world many things about Joe court that she wanted to remain secret and she had taken I think very very dramatic step to ensure that that did not occur she got away with so many things and she was proud of it that she's been married you know ten or eleven times six bigamy is out of that.
All these kids she says that she's had she hasn't and she couldn't stand it.
Joe said she was camping in a state park on the night of Bob's merger.
In order to completely eliminate her as a suspect investigators needed to be sure Boggs was killed at night and not earlier in the day.
Bogs murder presumably happened at night after dinner since onions were discovered in his stomach.
The concept the shack insisted they didn't put onions in box breakfast on the morning of his death.
One of steamboats homicide investigators decided to take a closer look not to be deterred he took himself down there and stood in the kitchen watch them making breakfast one morning.
True to his word the cook did not add onions to the hash Browns he threw on the grill.
But while watching the grill homicide investigators saw a flurry of activity that suddenly explained everything.
Every time the cook turned a omelet or scattered in order of hash Browns small portions of diced onions from other orders would get mixed in.
I believe he photographed the spatula that was used to flip the aches.
To grill the hash brown potatoes and edge of the fence was covered with bits of onion.
You don't know when you're getting the food at the other end with this what's going on on the grill.
Breakfast had in fact been Jerry Boggs last meal.
We felt vindicated you know that we felt very good about that because we knew they were there.
Boggs was killed just a few hours after breakfast.
Still the stomach contents yielded only circumstantial evidence.
I didn't have any direct evidence we didn't have any fingerprints any DNA anything that directly connected anyone to the crime scene we didn't have any thing in the nature of of a confession in connection with the case we didn't have a smoking gun type of evidence.
Armed with a search warrant police searched gill's car and found weeks maps of Mexico and the start.
Was it possible it was jailed in disguise that the neighbor saw walking in the vicinity of Jerry's home on the afternoon of his murder.
The weapon used in the jury box murder forty five caliber pistol was not found in jail courts Kerr but investigators suspected the stun gun in her trunk may have caused the unusual marks on the bogs face and neck which were noted during the autopsy.
Stun gun injuries fall into the category of injuries called patterned injuries which means the injuries mirrors the object that caused them so in the case of the stun gun injury you will have a lecture for burns mimic the distance between the electrodes that cause them the injuries lined up identically with the distance between the electrodes.
Pigskin most closely resembles human skin.
So Dr Dover center plied the stun gun to a live anesthetized pick to see if he could reproduce the round a reddish marks on Jerry Boggs neck and face.
The marks were similar interestingly enough the animal has to be alive in order to show the characteristic injuries which also means that Jerry Boggs was alive at the time that he sustained those injuries.
The forensic evidence was bringing the crime into focus.
The witnesses who reported seeing two men near Jerry's home on the day of the murder said Jill quite and her boyfriend Michael Backus resembled the man in height.
Jill like to wear disguises and had a number of disguises and eventually we even came up with a photograph they've been taken of her sometime prior to the homicide where she was wearing appeared in the mustache.
And Jill's alibi disintegrated when police could find no evidence that she had signed in and paid the admission fee to put through a national park on the day of the murder.
June tenth Michael Backus were arrested and charged with first degree murder.
At the preliminary hearing.
Even Jill was impressed with the forensic evidence against her I remember presenting all of that from the judge and she was there at the end I picked up all my materials and slides and walked out next to her and she looked at me and said nice job.
And then I I I took that is quite a compliment.
And there was a surprise witness Jill's son Sam testified against her.
To let him know I believe her words to him were something to the effect that it's over and it was messing.
It did not appear to me that he really had participated in any meaningful way that he had been a conspirator in connection with that.
To me that he had been very little more than I'm willing person being provided information by somebody who was trying to get him to engage in activity.
Prosecutors believe that Michael back essential quite in disguise entered Jerry's home in the early afternoon with the intent of murdering Boggs presumably to end their financial dispute.
After having his usual breakfast of eggs toast and hash Browns which had been unknowingly spiked with onions box left work early that day and arrived home sometime after one PM.
When he did.
Jill and her boyfriend were waiting.
This was ambushed at the back door first with the start then with the shovels after a suffocation attempt failed prosecutors believe it was a little shocked box three times with the twenty five caliber.
The two were careful not to leave incriminating evidence and their disguises we're almost foolproof.
They never realized forensic science could identify the specific items in bogs stomach which destroyed their flimsy alibi.
When news of the crime became public.
Chills coldest son William came forward with his suspicions that his mother had also killed his father William quite senior some twenty years earlier.
She'S more like a praying mantis she just devour some and she gets a hold of them.
It took the jury only five hours to find chilled quite and Michael Backus guilty of first degree murder I think she was more was motivated on the money I think she thought that would make her happy in life.
And look where she is so apparently money can't buy you everything.
They were both sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole.
I believe that Joe court was aware that there are methods for determining time of death I don't think she was aware that the stomach contents could be that telling.
At dawn ultimately deliver alibi how the water I think she was pretty clever they were pretty clever and in.
Wearing you know bringing along closing in or plastic bags or whatever they use to camouflage themselves from from leaving forensic evidence I mean they.
There were no friends no hairs nothing so they they were very cautious about that but.
