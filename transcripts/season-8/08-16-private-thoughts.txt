When firefighters found an entire family Dan.
It looked like a murder suicide but there were several inconsistent moves in the rubble.
Ballistics a time card and some secret audio tapes on Ravel the mystery.
A break on August twenty ninth nineteen ninety four firefighters in Vinton Virginia were called to a house fire on Virginia Avenue.
When the fire was extinguished rescuers found the bodies of all four members of the Hodges family.
Forty one year old lane Hodges is thirty seven year old wife to reset their two daughters eleven year old winter and three year old and I think it's hard enough to lose one family member but when she leaves for the non.
And the grief that that comes over you is on bearable.
Theresa Hodges was on the sofa downstairs she had been strangled to death.
An empty diesel fuel can lay nearby.
Stairs the two little girls were in bad.
Both had been shot to death.
Blaine Hodges was dead from a gunshot wound in the master bedroom.
Twenty two caliber pistol was on the floor by some.
Look like Blaine Hodges had killed his wife and two young daughters and then.
Blaine arches had recently had some difficult times he had been fired from his job at the post office for allegedly stealing forty six hundred dollars they had been convicted of embezzlement charge was on the verge of going off to jail for short period of time so we found that our that would fit into the.
Motivating factor the maybe wanted to.
Blaine was about to begin serving a six month prison sentence for that crime it also been ordered to make restitution of ninety two hundred dollars a sum he apparently did not have.
Was it possible that the prospect of jail and the large financial payment calls touches to snap.
At the autopsy the medical examiner Dr William Marcelo made a startling discovery.
Blaine Hodges didn't have any sort in his lungs or breathing passages which would have been president had he set the fire before killing himself.
And Blaine's body revealed even more troubling information.
Mr Hodges showed signs of what we called the cave which were more consistent with his having been dead for many many hours or even days when compared to the other.
And I thought at first that he was just pulling my leg because I've known him so long then when he said Barry said I'm serious.
There was no way Blaine Hodges could have killed his family if he was already dead.
That would be apparent in about it they get the hands on a site that forensic determination from the the autopsy in able to police to know.
We don't have a murder suicide you know the girls could have shot themselves through the head twice to reset could not have strangled herself and set herself on fire.
In order to buy time police did not reveal any of these forensic details to the media or the family members stated that there had been a fire.
They had died in the fire.
And that was all basically it was just that we we didn't know very much at this point in time.
This minor deception would give them time to find the real killer.
Police were investigating a suspicious house fire but it first appeared to be a murder suicide.
The forensic evidence revealed someone from outside the home murdered all four members of the Hodges family before setting the fire.
The evidence also revealed that Teresa Hodges had struggled with the killer.
Batches of her hair we're still on the staircase the fire had started near her body.
Since Theresa step brother had problems with the law police wondered whether the crime was some sort of pay back.
Isn'T that they got the idea from the.
So that that is a very that's that's where the drug relation came into play.
And police had another lease.
An elderly woman reported seeing a red pickup truck leaving the Hodges driveway shortly before the fire.
Police interviewed all of the hard his relatives as well as the man who spent more time at the Hodges home than anyone else Blaine's best friend and former high school track coach world brand.
Everyone that the police came in contact with said if you wanna know what's going on in that house or what has gone on in that house go find or Bramblett he is a close friend of the family he is always over there he is always doing things with blame.
Bramblett told police that he went fishing with the Hodges the day before the fire and that he had no idea who would have wanted to harm the family.
Bramblett said something revealing about Blaine Hodges during the interrogation S. O. B..
Newspapers reported only that the family died in a house fire and said nothing about a murder suicide.
Background check revealed that Bramblett had previous brushes with the law.
In nineteen seventy seven he had been a suspect in the disappearance of two Roanoke girls whose bodies had never been found he was also accused of molesting a young girl in nineteen eighty four.
Police search Bramblett home which was nothing more than a room in a nearby motels.
Inside they found numerous crime novels and textbooks he had one book in this position support forensic science.
And the techniques used by forensic science.
Police also found a detective magazine featuring an article about a murder committed with the pistol with no barrel.
But in the back of Bramblett struck were several twenty two caliber cartridge shells.
Police then visited Bramblett send players to see if he was at work on the day of the murders.
On brand let's time card for that day one of the entries had been blacked out.
And police found a pair of blue jeans soaking in a back room sink.
Could forensic scientists tell whether any of these items were somehow related to the murders.
And if Bramblett was involved.
What was his motive.
Team of forensic scientists at the western Virginia crime lab analyzed the items recovered from their prime suspects all.
Using a process known as the charcoal to method arson investigator Tom Simpson placed samples of girl Bramblett stained blue jeans in a can and then he did it.
The vapors were trapped in it too filled with charcoal.
Then fed into a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer a device that can analyze the precise chemical composition of the stain.
Even though brand let's jeans had been submerged in water Simpson discovered the stains were diesel fuel the same accelerate used to start the Hodges fire diesel fuel is very good to get of our spread very quickly if something is soaked in diesel fuel it may not flare up as quickly but it will burn much hotter.
The blacked out entry on brand let's time card presented another challenge.
The rent check documents examiner Gordon Menzies use of video spectral comparator with various light sources in an attempt to see underneath the black king.
Slowly the information came into view.
I was able to come up with an original entry that was five oh eight AM which would have been five in the morning on Monday according to what I understand about the coast time clock.
Five oh eight in the morning was only twenty minutes after neighbors reported the fire at the hotties home.
And let's work place was only a twenty minute drive from the Hodges home.
And there was no doubt about whose writing was on the time card.
Yes I concluded that the hand writing was also.
It'S one of the first things you notice with brambles hand writing is a very old sized lower case K. almost looks like a capital R..
The rent check handwriting analysis also solve another mystery.
In the dumpster behind Brandless workplace police found a page torn from a desk blotter with some unusual drawing.
Hello flames drone around the body if somebody look like laying on the church the whole staff steps drawn to look like you're going up the stairs inside of a building.
Police believe the arrows represent gunshot.
The circle around the neck represents the strangulation.
Once again this was information only the killer would know since it hadn't been released to the public.
The hand writing at the bottom of the page was consistent with Bramblett snowing handwriting samples.
Firearms expert Dan Roberts compared the bullets from the murder victims to the gun found next to Blaine Hodges body.
Even though the gun had no barrels it's still at its firing.
Under a comparison microscope you can see the unique marks made on the shelves from the guns firing pin.
The firing pin marks from the gun at the crime scene matched the spent casings found in Bramblett struck and the casings found in the Hodges home.
The FBI conducted an elemental analysis on the bullet fragments removed from the bodies.
This particular to itself because of the amount of trace elements they put in in.
This analysis of the land by the F. B. I. proved that the bullets from the victims bodies were made from the same batch of molten metal as the unusable that's found in the home of pearl brand.
One thing troubled investigators.
Why did the witness to identify a red pickup truck leaving the hard disk drive way around the time of the fire.
This is what a white pickup truck looks like under the sodium vapor lighting near the Hodges home.
It makes the white truck looks like a red truck.
The forensic evidence tied Earl Bramblett to the mergers.
But it was Bramblett himself unwittingly revealed the motive.
In Brandless trash police found a late notice for a storage locker rental near his home.
Ironically in the name of the place was winters mini storage still the same way as winter Hodges nine.
Inside were boxes and boxes of audio tapes.
And what he said.
About eleven year old winter Hodges.
It was very damaging to most ram this follows what is motivating factors were with little winter.
The pedophile yes cations that head towards her.
After nearly two years of investigation Roanoke county prosecutors finally had enough evidence to arrest Earl Bramblett for the murder of the Hodges family it's time we know it well enough let's go all the forensics are done I think we had basically everything we needed after about a year and a half to a year in eight months.
Earl Bramblett was ready to.
That was one of the few times Bramblett ever spoke in court.
But jurors heard his voice many times on the audio tapes.
At one point Bramblett said he feared Blaine Hodges was out to get.
Our jails are using some kind of sexual harassment toward me his focus when you listen to those tapes was that the family was trying to use the oldest daughter as sexual bait to entrap him of the situation so he could be prosecuted for that and that would somehow get Tom Blaine Hodges out of trouble.
Leach says Blaine Hodges never tried to reduce his prison term on the embezzlement conviction by trying to entrap Bramblett leach believes it was all a figment of Bram blitz imagination quite frankly his paranoia that that to the point that that I think that's a factor in a huge factor in why committed the crime.
On the day of the murders Bramblett had plans to go fishing with the hardest family.
He probably used some rules to speak with Blaine alone inside the house.
And then shot.
To make it look like suicide.
Bramblett then went outside telling Theresa and the girls that plane had decided to stay home to do some chores instead so Bramblett took them fishing along.
Park Rangers said he saw Bramblett Theresa and the two girls at the lake that day.
When they returned home Bramblett may have wanted to resell or one of the girls to discover Blaine's body confirming it as a suicide rather than murder.
Theresa may have found Blaine's body and believed it was a murder suicide.
As she came downstairs a struggle ensued on the stairs to Reese's here was left on the.
In the children's room and shot them to death.
Bramblett removed the barrel of the pistol before planting it to complicate ballistic testing.
But it raised serious doubts that a man would commit suicide with a pistol with no.
Bramblett returned to the Hodges home later with diesel fuel.
He poured the diesel fuel downstairs to start the house but it didn't burn the house enough to prevent forensic analysis.
It Bramblett minutes good an arsonist as he was a killer we would never prosecute.
Bramblett then drove to work where he made a number of mistakes.
He punched the time clock either from force of habit or green so that he'd be paid for coming in early.
It placed him in the vicinity of the Hodges home around the time of the fire was reported.
Bramblett tried to remove the diesel fuel stains from his blue jeans by soaking them in water but forensic testing easily identified.
Bramblett unwittingly revealed his complicity by drawing the injury on stick figures on a piece of paper at work later matched to Bramblett by handwriting analysis.
In addition to the forensic evidence prosecutors also had brand let's audio tapes.
Any time you can get words coming from a defendant's math and they all are about the subject of the crime and here they were about this the Hodges family if it can be extremely important I think that was very effective with the jury.
During about one hour to convict Earl Bramblett.
It just fit together to the point that we had twelve people sitting here who were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt the girl did it and I don't I would assume at this point that they haven't had a doubt to this day.
So it was it was T. the forensic evidence.
Bramblett was sentenced to death.
He was executed on April ninth two thousand three in Virginia's electric chair for several people make the statement that they were murdered they want to see on the case because he won't stop until the case is solved he's like Colombo on TV this is a hound dog bulldog.
Had it not been for forensic science we will not be here today talking murder around being convicted next year.
But in this case it is the forensic files.
