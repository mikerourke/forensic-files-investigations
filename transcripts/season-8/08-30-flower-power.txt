Two different man called police to report the same murder.
Apparently neither one knew that the doctor had to call.
The investigation uncovered even more unusual circumstance.
But a few tiny seeds and the discarded candy wrapper for more than just in significant clues they told the story of revenge.
Like many divorced people Pamela Sweeney hope she finds someone to share her life with.
Construction worker Larry flex was the man she set her sights on.
We'Re talking about probably moving on Minneapolis at one time.
Just having a good time is two of us.
Amil worked as a secretary for a computer company outside Minneapolis.
The most important thing in her life was a five year old son Tony.
On the Friday before Memorial Day in nineteen ninety one.
Ham told her parents she wasn't feeling well and asked if they could take care of her son overnight.
She told them she was just going to take a bath and go to bed.
It'S going to be really late.
Chooses I want you to come over tonight.
Says he arrived at Pam's house around three o'clock in the morning.
When you look into Pam's bedroom he knew something was terribly wrong C. and.
Spot of blood.
oh my goodness and in the bad shoes wearing Chrysler crossways all wrapped up rolled up in a blanket I don't want to do it but I took the covers.
Like ran to a neighbor's house to call police.
Less than two minutes later as police were on their way they got another telephone call.
This one from one of Pam's co workers Patrick Walsh.
Two means calling in stating that a female they had known something terrible had happened to her and they needed the police when questioned both men had unusual stories to tell.
Larry Fleck said Pam invited him and that he ran from our house because he thought the killer was still inside.
Patrick Walsh said he drove by Pam's house on his way home from a local bar he said the lights were on and he wanted to check on her because she had been out sick that day at work.
Police now had a dead woman and two men at the house at three o'clock in the morning.
Investigators hope forensic evidence would sort through what was to become a very complicated.
When Pam Sweeney was found murdered in her own bed police had to deal with a highly unusual situation two men were at sea they didn't know each other but both knew the victim.
Everybody is a suspect and when they got out there they had Patrick Walsh he's a suspect he secured his hand Cup they process the scene Larry Fleck was at the neighbor's house another officer went there to secure him.
Pam Sweeney had been shot four times stand for.
You just do a dog like a your targets to bind your stomach and you don't know what's you're just like theirs are coming going on in your head you don't what's going on around you.
Pam'S parents were asked to they thought might have killed their daughter and they had a ready answer you know I thought her ex husband was on the done it.
Yet thirty something weapons in the house.
So we I'll ask first thing I thought was well since it's Pam is gonna be might.
Times home there were no signs of forced entry.
And there was another the tam knew her killer we believe after he completed the final blow and she was dead he saw the dead body he in an act of contrition cover the body completely who's completely covered we think he did that so as not to see what he did to cover it up out of sight out of mind.
The murder weapons could not be found in the house.
But as the sun rose investigators saw a path in the do you get it settled on the lawn it led to a wooded area behind the house.
It'S also got on their hands and knees and went through that backwards inch by inch back there was found a knife which had been stuck into the ground right to the handle and the small revolver was found lodged under some loose boards that were laying behind the shed.
A nice match to set of kitchen knives inside the house.
A pistol was the same caliber as the one used in the crime.
Both had been wiped clean of blood and fingerprints.
In front of Pam's home investigators found a close first ought to be insignificant.
Police found a candy wrapper the same candy was found in pain Sweeney's kitchen.
This brand of candy had a lot number on the record.
When police compared the lot number on the candy in Pam's house with the rapper in Walsh's crock it was a match so we drew an inference from that that this guy while he was there this call may not actually take when those bags of candy I was drawer needed.
This was inconsistent with Walsh's story he said after he found Pam's body he called police then ran outside to his car to try to get help.
If this were true.
Would he have stopped on his way out of the house to grab a piece of candy.
Perhaps the most bizarre incident and the case was that washes car was stuck in a ditch next to Pam's driveway wall said he accidentally drove into the ditch when going for help.
Both Patrick Walsh and Pam's boyfriend Flack had what appeared to be blood stains on their trousers.
And they both had plausible explanations both men said they were close to Pam's body when each discovered she was dead.
During the time that Patrick Walsh is being processed at the jail they of course removed all of his clothing and his shoes and socks and we.
On the back of the shirt located a leaf.
And in his shoes we located a number of different types of vegetation.
Investigators wondered whether this vegetation was enough to identify a killer.
While investigating the murder of thirty five year old Pamela Sweeney police said three suspects.
Hams ex husband or boyfriend and her co worker.
Police learned the ex husband was with friends on the night of the murder and was eliminated as a suspect.
Ms boyfriend also denied any involvement dare ask questions like how long a newer.
If I always come more there that time of night.
Why so late in the evening I shop this person's house.
When Patrick Walsh's name came up as a suspect in Pam's merger.
For family and friends said they weren't surprised.
Nader day she did call the police but there was nothing they could do.
Pastor Thomas Braun got a call from her a few months before the murder.
There was a great amount of fear in her voice she was she was beyond herself she couldn't think straight emotionally physically she was she was a rack.
Bush was married and worked as a supervisor in the same company as spam.
She told friends that Walsh asked her out on numerous occasions and wouldn't take no for an answer.
He also stopped by her home unannounced and perform various household chores without being asked in an attempt to win her affections they had been stalking her for months obsessed with her physically in his in his mind and his entire being.
She'S ever talked to me about she's never said.
Somebody was taunting or falling or things like that she's never said a word to me.
I did however go to the police.
They told her wash hadn't broken the law and it was nothing they could do.
In their search for evidence investigators focused on the vegetation found on washes clothes and shoes.
Paul said it probably got there when he walked across pans front lawn towards his car this gave police an idea we did something I'd never done before we contact the university of Minnesota and we ask for a taxonomist a forensic taxonomist.
A taxonomist is an expert in living organisms.
Dr I need a cello examined the various bits of leaves grass and other vegetation from washes clothing.
There was some seeds of quack grass.
Quack grass is a common wheat and it really produces seeds since people usually mo it before it gets to the flowering stage.
This meant that the crabgrass seeds on washes clothing were rare and unusual.
Dr Chalabi also discovered another species on washes clothes scenes from an aspen tree which are called bracts.
Aspen is fairly common in Minnesota but it's not the sort of thing that you'd see in someone's backyard.
Dr John but didn't find any grass or aspen Brax around Walsh's home.
There was a lot of grass in there a number of other things too but the quack grass was and it had clearly been flowering and fruiting and that would live.
She also found numerous aspen practice.
The area Dr Jalloh identified was the exact spot where investigators found the murder weapon.
She was convinced the specimens on washes clothing were relatively fresh.
Wooden patched itself to him for long periods of time and had to be something real recent in order to still be attached his pants and stocking issues.
But this was far from conclusive evidence so police turned to a more traditional crime science they analyzed the blood spatter the crime scene.
Well said he briefly shook hands body to see if she was alive before he ran from her room.
But the blood on his clothing told a different story.
The staining was consistent with him coming in contact with a large amount of her blood on his pants leg hand stands consistent with spatter being found on him which would indicate that he had been in close proximity when she was being stabbed.
And the size and shape of the spatter indicated the blood washes pans from a blood covered object that had been in motion.
Investigators found similar blood spatter on the ceiling above the bed these were perfectly circular indicating the blood went straight up from the impact site.
The blood spatters gives a fairly good idea of where she may have banned and also the nature of the tack and how how violent was how brutal it was how the knife was wielded I could look at the bloodstain patterns on the walls and determine the site where this impact took place and this was right on the bed where she was found and it indicated that that's exactly where she was attacked on the bed.
She was stabbed in the bedroom but shot elsewhere.
There was a blood trail leading to the bedroom from the foyer and bullets were found in the floor this was where Pam Sweeney was shot.
We believe she was probably shot first and lower levels of the house and dragged or carried up stairs and then stabbed in her bedroom.
Bloodstain on Walsh's pants was consistent with carrying a leading person.
The forensic evidence also explained why Patrick Walsh called police to report the murder.
Rick Welch in a panic attempting to leave the scene of this killing got in his pick up truck miscalculated the drive we drove into the ditch.
It'S now three o'clock in the morning he just murdered a young woman and his pick up truck is hopelessly stuck in a ditch what do you do.
A week before her death.
Pam Sweeney told her family she couldn't find a set of house keys and was considering changing her locks.
On the day of her murder.
The keys resurfaced.
In the front seat of Patrick Walsh's black pickup truck lo and behold was Pamela Sweeney's stolen keys so there was a direct connection he never really explain how it got there.
Police believe Walsh told the keys while he and Pam were at work proof they said that he planned the attack about a week before the killing he had called up an ex girlfriend and wanted to get his twenty two caliber handgun returned he had loaned it to earlier he wanted it back he claimed it was for elk hunting trip he was going to make but that was we found out later not planned for eight months down the road so we believe he was actively engaged in planning this well before.
The day of the killing.
He'S found a number of twenty two caliber shells.
Those were sent to the FBI laboratory for neutron activation analysis.
They were able to identify that the lead compositions in the lead fragments that we found in Sweeny skull matched the lead compositions that were in the shells found in Mr Walsh's apartment a few years earlier.
Walsh was allegedly involved in eight assault cases with other women.
And was a suspect in a previous murder.
Prosecutors believe when Pam Sweeney rejected washes advances he sought revenge.
Our belief was that that just infuriated him I think he took the view in his sick twisted psychotic mind how dare you reject me when I have been doing all of these overtly kind acts for you how dare you.
The evidence suggests Walsh entered Pam's home around eleven PM.
But you must've heard someone inside and made her way to the whole way.
Where she confronted Walsh there was an argument.
I think you projecting Walsh fired twice into the floor possibly to scare.
The next four shots it was a sweet.
Walch carried her to the bedroom and stabbed her to death causing the blood spatter on the ceiling and all his clothes then covered the body the tell tale clue that the killer was someone and you.
The evidence suggests Walsh stayed long enough to have a can of soda and grab a piece of candy.
And when he went to his car he left the candy wrapper on the seat beside him.
But he accidentally drove his car into a ravine on the side of the driveway and couldn't get it out.
Wash then went back inside the house in the basement to look for something to get his car free.
They had a surprise.
Pam'S boyfriend Larry flick arrived after work.
When you select discover the merger he ran to a neighbor's home for help.
Well she had to act quickly he tried again to move his car but couldn't so we had to remove the other.
The botanical evidence on his pants proved Walsh ran into the high grass and what's behind Pam's home the double the murder weapons.
When he returned and knowing police would find his car wash had no choice but to call police himself to make it appear as if he too had driven by and found him dead.
It was clear to me that the suspect had been in that would lock I don't see how he could have acquired that material any other way based on what the investigating officers knew of where he had been at the time of the crime and the previous twenty four hours.
Is going to that location and.
Picking up the soil samples and seeds from the local trees he did put himself right at the very spot I was trying to hide evidence that he didn't want to be connected to I think that's that's fairly significant.
Seven months after Pamela Sweeney's death Patrick close went to trial for first degree murder.
The sheer volume of forensic evidence against him was overwhelming.
It'S amazing when you're prosecuting a first degree murder case and you have a thousand puzzles and you're convinced that you have the right person it is amazing all those pieces of the puzzle start to fall together fitting perfectly.
Patrick Walsh was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.
Patrick Walsh is a psychopath.
And perhaps the most dangerous man I have ever seen I favor to just leave but then again from what I hear what's happening here once in a while in prison.
I think he's probably got a harder time right now being alive and being dead.
