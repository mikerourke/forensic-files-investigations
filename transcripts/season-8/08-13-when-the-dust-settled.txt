A union official was executed in his home not long after a strike by union membership.
No one in the neighborhood heard any gunshots.
It would take forensic sound test an electron microscope and the night down to explain why.
Thirty nine year old Joe Doyle was an official of the local apps may a union representing government employees.
It could be the most bitter cold day in the world and if you thought you were cold take a short off and give it to you even if you didn't know you now he also as big as he was he wasn't afraid to tell you exactly what he thought.
He got into people's faces.
Or they might have hated Joe and his wife Katie had been married for about eight years.
On July thirtieth nineteen ninety eight the couple went to a private club after work for drinks.
Early the next morning Katie phoned police in a panic.
Joe Doyle had been shot at close range.
Was an execution style killing.
When someone's dead with work for gunshot wounds to the head.
The first question anyone's gonna ask is did this person have enemies because obviously it wasn't a friend that did this.
There was no sign of forced entry and Joe's empty money clip was on the floor which according to Katie had contained approximately eighteen hundred dollars.
The first suspect in a murder like this is always the surviving spouse.
Cady'S hands were tested for gunshot residue which would have been president had she fired a gun the test was negative.
Katie told police that they got home from the club around eight thirty at dinner then went to bed.
Around midnight Katie said she went to sleep in a chastened bedroom.
It was because of shows really really really loud snoring but she couldn't take it she tried to get to sleep and she lay there for an hour or so but she finally had to leave and go into this next to our bedroom because of the storm.
The next morning when Katie went in to wake her husband she found him dead under the covers.
Katie insisted she didn't hear any gunshots neither did any of her neighbors.
One of the funniest thing is that the case was that no one heard the gunshots no one we really did not have any good evidence of any any hearing a gunshot sept nine.
It'S possible silencer could have been used.
It could be a a professional type a silencer that is affixed to the gun.
Police couldn't help but notice the amount of dust in the Doyle's home and wondered whether this might help the killer's movements and ultimately revealed his identity.
After the merger of thirty nine year old Joe Doyle's.
Friends and family told police that his marriage to wife Katie seems solid.
The couple were building an addition to their house and planning for the future.
Caitlyn it's telling the police that Joe was the love of her life that you love them more than you could love anyone that everything was perfect in their marriage but they just had sex the night before he was killed.
Joe and Katie both worked at the same hospital and their co workers gave police a different picture of their relationship.
Kate was having a brazen brazen affair with a co worker.
She was basically flaunting that relationship that she told people that she was obsessed with joining that she wanted nothing to do with her husband her husband was controlling it George was the love of her life.
George Lewis was a grounds keeper at the hospital and police found evidence the two were more than just lovers.
She purchases story form she gives him a thousand dollar down payment for a vehicle she purchased clothing for him she does everything form really.
JD admitted the affair but her lawyer says it meant nothing.
It was a flame it was not brief.
But it was not a motive for murder.
The crime scene.
Police found a clue in the night stand next to the bad.
In the night stand was a lock box marks in the dust indicated the box had recently been moved but no fingerprints were found.
Missing from the box was Joe Doyle's nine millimeter Mackerras pistols.
This is one of the four bullets recovered from Doyle's body deformed by impact.
When I hand gun is fired the bullet spins as it travels through the barrel the soft outer shell is scored by a corkscrew line into the barrel.
Causes a boat to rotate on its longitudinal axis given an aerodynamic stability while it's in flight the line cut into the bullet is called a group of the spaces between the groups are called lands.
These lands and grooves are different for each make of gun.
Investigators wanted to know whether this was from a pistol like the one owned by Joe to.
Using a comparison microscope forensic scientists compared the bullet from Joe Doyle's body to one fired from a macaron this.
On the macro office has four lands and grooves with a right twist and there are not many firearms that have.
That does class characteristics.
The results were clear.
Joe had been killed with the same model nine millimeter pistol that he had once owned but was now missing.
The bullets were consistent with being fired from this model.
So that was the evidence with the gun that's what they started with an eye on the defense side we established that there were at least three thousand.
Other guns of this make and model alone that existed in in our state about fourteen thousand in the country.
Police then looked into Joe's union ties.
There recently have been a strike with the union and the the victim was involved in some of the activities regarding that strike.
It was a strike by state employees.
Joe had the potentially dangerous task of re possessing the state owned cars driven by the striking members people can be volatile tempers.
Where up during a strike situation one person against another.
There could have been us some problems between him and one of the people whose cars were repossessed Joe in some sense was viewed as this type of tyrant he had this to confiscate vehicles tensions ran high you know arguments occurred that sort of thing and that's it the typical union scenario.
At the same time Katie told investigators that her husband was involved in projects children an organization which brings children from Northern Ireland to the United States for summer vacations.
Here'S a guy who travels to another country to a to a hot spot in the world a bit of terrorism a bit of strife.
Is this a part I mean I I think anyone with common sense would look into this and and see if there's a connection here.
Well the fact that he was executed in his own bed most likely at night while you're sleeping and no one knows seem to have heard shots let people believe Jeez they might have used to silence or that you know it's an execution this could be as a result of its ties with the I. R. A. if you had ties the investigation took forensic scientists from the United States all the way to Northern Ireland but the real evidence was rife in Joe Doyle's backyard.
Police investigating the murder of a thirty nine year old union official Joe Doyle pursued every possible lead looking into is union activities over the past several years as well as his involvement with the charity in Northern Ireland.
Police couldn't identify anyone angry enough with Doyle to want him dead.
So they look once again at his wife Katie and her lover George Lewis.
Research indicates he's background found evidence of substance abuse and financial disagreements.
Joe was tough on Katie Katie had a drug problem years before and Joe Carter Joe didn't trust Katie anymore didn't trust her with the money.
No relationship is perfect.
This one certainly wasn't a perfect relationship they're gonna take a microscope and examine.
The spouse their entire life and I'm gonna try to dig up any piece of dirt possible.
Her boyfriend George Lewis had an alibi for the night of Joe Doyle's murder.
George basically was a a real lover he had other girlfriends besides Katie apparently and so he was out with one of his girlfriends that night two people I'll bite him the first one which would be for the earlier part of the evening was with the other woman with whom he was having an affair and then for the later part of the evening was with his wife.
As for Katie Doyle she said that she had sex with her husband that night and later left to sleep in an adjacent bedroom because of Joe snoring.
The door was shot and the air conditioner was running and she claims she never heard the shots.
The head of her bed.
Would be resting against the wall.
That wall is the same wall that separates room from the bedroom where the victim is sleeping which puts them in extremely close proximity to each other matter of feet.
The distance was fifteen feet separated by a five inch wall in the closet investigators brought in Dr Harry hole lean operands equality experts to test Katie's claims.
When you fire a gun you explode some gun powder into characters in a barrel and that explosion is very rapid so the acoustic signal coming out of the barrel as the bullet comes out of the barrel very rapidly the acoustic signal also is is one that's very abrupt.
The mac rob generated between a hundred eighteen and one hundred twenty decibels of sound.
And in the other car probable to a motorcycle heavy bus close by Powell on more chain saw things such as that.
The sound created by a gun is a short duration.
Katie Doyle have heard it.
To find out only use two adjacent bedrooms in his house.
He then put the recording he had made of the Mackerras pistol in one bedroom and a sound major in the other bedroom.
If the shock was one hundred eighty decibels sixty percent of that sound approximately seventy decibels reach the other bedroom.
If you're a slave there's a very good chance that it would wake you up.
And forensic scientists found another discrepancy in Katie's story.
Katie said she left Joe's bedroom around midnight and that she found him dead at six AM.
But forensic scientists found alcohol in Joe's stomach the alcohol he consumed at the club would all have been absorbed in his body had been killed after midnight.
The medical examiner estimated the time of death was closer to ten PM.
This could easily explain why neighbors didn't hear the shots the ambient sounds of televisions radios and stereos at that time of night could easily have muffled them.
Next investigators wanted to test Katie's night gown that was found on the floor next to Joe's body.
Pulling the trigger create a small explosion when the primary nights the gun powder which in turn propels the bullet.
Gasses from that explosion create a small cloud about three to five feet in diameter that usually walks back over the shooter the gases from the primers gate from the firearm to any available opening.
In the form of a gas or a vapor then solidifies into tiny particles which are deposited on the hands clothing or the immediate proximity of the discharge.
Using an aluminum desk with the permanent adhesive scientist skip school board lifted samples from the surface of the night down.
Next he removed the stone from its plastic holder and placed it inside a scanning electron microscope.
The particles are magnified and scans to reveal their chemical makeup.
On Katie Doylestown with thousands of particles seen here magnified four thousand times.
They were made up of lead antimony and bury them the chemical components of gun powder.
It'S not natural in the environment when it's when those three particles are fused together that's unique to gunshot residue.
Sure also found gunshot residue on the betting next to the body.
Gunshot residue is going to get on the bed in on items on the bed.
Katie said that before she left that room and went to the other room to go to sleep she took her nightgown off.
Threw it on the bed she doesn't recall where she threw it on the bed it was dark.
With no gunshot residue on Katie's hands and gunshot residue on the bedding as well as her night gown prosecutors had no forensic evidence Katie Doyle fired the pistol.
And without forensic evidence prosecutors had plenty of suspicion.
Police believe Katie Doyle lied when she told them her husband was alive when she left his bedroom around midnight.
An analysis of the stomach contents put the merger closer to ten PM.
According to their home phone records someone call for Joe shortly after ten PM and what Katie told the caller was revealing.
She said that the victim couldn't come to the phone because he was toast in other words he was intoxicated.
And that's why I couldn't talk on the phone.
There was no gunshot residue on Katie's hands but her night gown found on the floor did test positive for gunshot residue and so did the covers on the bed.
Well Paul decided to analyze tonight down to study the exact concentrations and placement of the rest of you.
Twenty years ago when we didn't have the automated analysis by scanning electron microscope a sample could take twelve thirteen hours looking at it manually today were able to look at.
Many thousands of particles in a short period of time.
Those tests revealed large amounts of residue on both the right and left front chest area consistent with where I've gone would be positioned.
That was all the evidence police needed the significance of the gown.
Is the reason why I arrested.
The victim's wife for the murder of her husband.
Prosecutors think they know the motive for the murder.
She was head over heels over the skies she didn't want show anymore I mean this is your standard one spouse not wanting to be married.
The forensic evidence shows that Joe Doyle was in bad sometime before ten PM.
Prosecutors believe Katie went into the bedroom took her husband's nine millimeter pistol from the lock box then fired four shots into his head at close range.
The invisible gunshot vapor drifted backwards towards her and settled on her night gown.
Katie took off her night gown and threw it on the floor to show police the two had slept together but it was proof of something else proof that she had worn it while killing her husband.
Katie had seven or eight hours to leave home and get rid of the pistols.
The next morning neighbors said Katie's car was in a different parking spot from where it was the night before.
According to telephone records Katie called her boyfriend three times on the night of the murder.
Prosecutors don't believe the boyfriend was involved.
If she even acknowledge an admitted that that she had gotten in touch with George at night if he had any role in it we have no proof of it.
Katie Doyle was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Her lawyer maintains Katie is innocent but he has no idea who killed John.
Why are we looking a cake because she's the wife because the police don't want to get outside the house because that's their mode of investigation and they're stuck there and they're stuck there to this day.
Investigators say science leaves no doubt about the killer's identity.
It'S much harder to get away with the crime today than it was years ago we have instrumentation.
That are much more advanced now.
We can do particle extractions from clothing from hands and it doesn't have to be specifically gunshot residue if it would have been again with with the work that skip bush will will did with the Michael particles that were found on the nature she had been wearing the night that this is a curse we probably would never had enough.
Information to make an arrest.
Let alone to get a conviction I'd rather rely on science every case and on human beings science especially when you can get different areas of science all pointing to the same suspect is key to any prosecution.
