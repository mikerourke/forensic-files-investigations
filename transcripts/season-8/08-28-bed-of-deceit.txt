Police officer was found shot to death in his bedroom but it was unclear exactly what happened.
Some of the evidence pointed to suicide while other signs suggested foul play but it took crime scene reconstruction and automated teller machine and some forensic textbooks in the victim's home to write the final chapter in this real life food done.
Traverse city Michigan it's a beautiful area for those who loves sailing and fishing.
And it was home to Dan and Cynthia macdonald and their two teenage children.
Fifty eight year old Dan McDonald was a retired police officer who worked part time as a maintenance worker.
In like a normal marriage.
Cindy taking charge all the time I mean she was.
Master of the household and the boss.
The last day in December in nineteen ninety eight was a busy one for the McDonnell family.
Eighteen year old Patrick was sleeping over at a friend's house Dan decided to sleep late.
Cynthia and their twenty year old daughter Erin spent the day shopping in traverse city.
For several hours they went from shop to shop stopping at a local department store an office supply store and the beauty shop.
On the way home Cynthia picked up hamburgers for the whole family.
But when they arrived home shortly after noon.
They found Dan.
Did of a single gunshot wound.
We have guns in the house.
My sister had called us on the phone.
And she said that.
I have to break some bad news G. I just saw it on television.
Your brother was.
Investigators found no gun near the body but several hundred dollars was missing from his wallet so robbery was a possibility.
I was devastated.
I couldn't believe this good man hurt nobody.
I was not living anymore.
Police were able to confirm that Cynthia and her children were out all morning.
It would take the crime scene reconstruction to determine what really happened to Dan McDonnell.
On the afternoon of new year's eve nineteen ninety eight retired police officer Dan McDonald was found dead in his bedroom of a single gunshot wound to his head.
Dan'S wife Cynthia told police she suspected robbery but there were no signs of forced entry and police were suspicious.
When police questioned Cynthia a second time she said she had a confession to make.
On a call that said she changed her story it wasn't a robbery she came down in the morning and found that he committed suicide.
This is a tape recording of Cynthia statement to police.
I was almost ready to go and I told our regular clothes and stuff and get the car warmed up and I wanted to tell Dan.
Cynthia told police that Dan had undergone surgery for prostate cancer which had left him impotent.
According to Cynthia Dan left a suicide note but she destroyed it.
The note said I'm devastated over my prostate cancer I want you to have the insurance money and to the effect that if they found out that it was a suicide there would be no insurance in that the children would not get the money.
Dan had three hundred thousand dollars worth of life insurance but the policies were negated in the event then committed suicide.
If there is a suicide the insurance wouldn't pay and the only reason we got it was for the kids college expenses.
Cynthia said she complied with Dan's wishes and altered the scene to make the death appeared to be a homicide.
She said she wiped her husband's prints from the gun then continued on the shopping trip with her daughter so she wouldn't arouse suspicion.
What we might perceive as normal response would be to just.
Fall apart instantaneously.
But not all of us are that way until we're in the situation I think it's impossible to say how human being would react.
Cynthia said she threw her husband's revolver into a nearby field although police search dogs and metal detectors I couldn't find it.
She certainly committed foul play by.
Changing the C..
She committed a foul play by disposing of a firearm.
Those are pretty good indicators.
To open up a serious investigation.
My brother did not commit suicide he's going to buy a boat he was going to buy a new truck.
So a man it makes these kind of plans is not one that is attempting suicide.
At the autopsy Dr David start look for the telltale signs of suicide.
X. rays of Dennis have revealed the bullet was still inside his skull.
So the wound in the back of his head was that entry will.
It certainly raises the possibility that it's not a self inflicted gunshot wound that this gunshot wound could have been and inflicted by another person in particular given the location in the back of the.
Cynthia'S lawyer says that this wasn't proof of a homicide only that Dan himself may have played a role in the deception.
If anybody has the ability to.
Understand how to.
You know self inflict a mortal injury on oneself so to speak and make it look like a homicide this is a man who had probably as much understanding as anybody else and that might have been on his mind that.
Hey you know if I can make this look like a homicide my family will get the life insurance.
But investigators discovered something else.
Cynthia McDonnell wasn't just a freelance writer she was an aspiring murder mystery writer.
And police also learned that Cynthia had made some derogatory statements about them at a neighborhood cocktail party.
And she said you could commit a murder and the police were not smart enough in northern Michigan.
I didn't sit very well.
The state police.
Police decided to take a closer look at some of Cynthia's stories.
Police were investigating the mysterious death of retired police officer Dan McDonnell's.
The victim's wife Cynthia said her husband committed suicide.
And that initially she hid that fact so the family could collect on his life insurance policy.
Almost immediately forensic experts found some inconsistencies.
The X. rays showed the bullet going from back to front as it goes through the brain.
And from left to right.
As it goes through the brain it was obvious it would have had to come from the left side from someone who is left handed and the victim Daniel was writing.
A suicide victim rarely shoots himself in the back of the head.
There needed to be some additional investigation done that this case very well could represent a homicide and allow the police to further their investigation investigators began their analysis by studying the blood spatter.
Whenever a blood disorder speed a pool of blood or be it I had someone a bullet points or had that blood travels in a straight line but it can travel in a three hundred and sixty degree radius so completely out in all directions.
The blood that comes back toward this the forces being applied is what we call the backscatter but there was no blood spatter on either of Dan's hands.
Dans left arm was touching the pillow and talk underneath his body.
Next to his arm was a clearly defined pool of blood.
This proved dans left arm never moved after the shooting.
There was no change in the blood stain pattern to indicate that that are meant ever been in any other position either at the time of shooting or immediately after shooting so it indicates that there was a position that that body was sent at the time that we shot it would have been difficult for Dan to use his right hand to shoot himself in the left side of the head.
Right hand in order to inflict this moon would then have to have come around the back of the head.
Around and then being able to get the muscle.
Two of the head.
What should it be contortions to do.
So you have a little bit difficulty with the trajectory but definitely can be done however once it's done your hand is going to remain up here it's not going to be able to talk itself back underneath the covers remain completely bloodless and completely free of stippling from the cylinder gap or any power.
And end up next to the body without a drop of blood on it that's not possible.
Investigators also found gun powder and a bullet hole in the pillow next to Dan's body.
This indicated that the gun was pressed against the pillow and fired the only way that this could have happened is that this person would have had three arms on Monday hold a gun one to hold the pillow down and the one that is going on on this website.
Dan'S death was ruled a homicide.
Looking to Dan and Cynthia's marriage revealed a possible motive.
In the months before Dan's murder the McDonald's were spending more money than they were bringing in.
Cindy was buying all of these objects like computers like the furniture like numerous things that were quite expensive items.
Investigators also discovered the Dan managed a trust fund for a mentally handicapped relative.
In the year before Dan's death more than fifty thousand dollars had been taken from this trust account and the bank had been demanding answers.
Bank documents showed withdrawals ranging from two hundred to a thousand dollars almost every other day and the fund was virtually depleted.
And bank surveillance cameras identified the individual who was responsible.
When police interviewed Dan McDonnell's twenty year old daughter Erin.
She remembered something unusual about the morning her father was killed.
Here in places herself in the shower and explain to the investigators that her mother came in to check on her a number of times which was out of character also turned up the radio while Aaron was in the shower she told investigators that she heard.
inside the McDonald's home.
He'S found forensic textbooks Cynthia was using in her research for a murder mystery she planned to run.
With titles like body trauma and armed and dangerous there were chapters entitled accidental shooting versus suicide who shot whom and premeditated domestic killing.
Prosecutors believe Cynthia consulted these books the plan what she thought would be the perfect crime.
The motive was money.
Cynthia was in financial trouble so she withdrew fifty thousand dollars from a trust fund her husband was managing by forging his name.
Surveillance cameras at the banks automated teller machines proved it.
The bank contacted Dan and demanded answers.
Prosecutors believe Dan confronted Cynthia and told her he was going to local authorities with a plan to return the funds.
On new year's eve.
While Aaron was in the shower.
Cynthia went into the bathroom to turn up the volume on the radio the mass the sound of the gunshot.
Prosecutors say Cynthia took damn service revolver and fired it into the back of his head using the pillow to muffle the sound.
She later disposed of the gun although it has never been recovered.
Sincere then went shopping with Erin thinking the sales receipts would give her an alibi.
Before returning home.
She even stopped to buy hamburgers she even bought one for her husband even though she knew he was dead.
It'S a match.
Thank god she can get away with it I mean ordering your dead husband hamburger.
Cynthia McDonald was charged with first degree murder.
She pleaded not guilty.
Our defense included testimony from an outside forensic expert Dr L. J. dragovich who said that it was possible Dan McDonnell's death could have been suicide.
Dr dragovich demonstrated how he thought Dan could have taken his own life and left gun powder residue and a hole in the pillowcase.
You can have the gun in your left hand and pulled the trigger with your left index finger with the pillowcase he is trapped between the muscle and that the head doctor dragovich also points out that gun powder residue tests were conducted on Dan McDonnell's hands which might have proved he had fired the weapon.
It would have made that essence a stronger case for the prosecution of course Hey the bean positive comp other isn't you on the hands of the scene.
To close the case.
The medical examiner says it wasn't necessary.
We did not test for gunshot residue at the time of autopsy in my opinion it would not have given any significance to the overall findings of the case in that a person can be found with gunshot residue on their hands even if if they're in close proximity to another person firing a gun so that's a test that's although often referred to is not routinely perform.
As in most cases it's the jury's job to make the final judgment.
Her daughter Erin told the judge to show no mercy.
Why this had to happen to us we had a good feeling my father was a good man.
Cynthia macdonald was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole.
She continues to claim that she is innocent of killing her husband whom she calls mac.
Matt committed suicide I didn't kill my husband I loved it had nothing to gain by his dad and everything to lose this is devastated by children split the family apart.
Cynthia is devoid of a conscience devoid of any responsibility and she will never admit her guilt Cindy is an individual that will resolve.
Problems her shortcomings by violence and murder.
Kevin McDonald keeps his brother's police badge close by.
What can you say.
Over and done with.
Even though Cynthia study books on forensics she didn't realize that science would tell the real story.
So maybe she could read just enough that she thought she could do it and get away with that and.
It had read not yet enough to realize that there's a whole lot more involved in real life down there isn't.
And Cynthia's other mistake was in changing the plot she originally tried to make the death look like an intruder killed her husband.
But when she forgot to create the illusion of forced entry.
She had no alternative but to change her story.
When the officers to question her she blinked and went with another story that she thought they would buy.
In this case if she wanted it to look like a homicide it certainly did Cynthia macdonald Bragg she could write the book on the perfect murder well she should read the final chapter where there are no perfect murders.
