In a crowded London Underground station a small routine fire suddenly erupts into a deadly inferno and killed thirty one people dozens more are injured.
Team of forensic experts searches for clues to the cause of the blaze and fines the fire seems to defy the very laws of physics to unravel the calls of the mysterious fire investigators would need to recreate historic train station inside a modern.
The sprawling London Underground is the largest and oldest subway rail system in the world.
But on the evening of November eighteenth nineteen eighty seven commuters are unaware that disaster lurks beneath.
At seven thirty PM a passenger at the historic king's cross station sees a flicker of flames underneath the heavily varnished fifty year old wooden escalators.
The London fire brigade is dispatched it seems to be a routine call and everybody cool to find in this light is something we were receiving probably twenty or thirty times a month.
Fire captain Roger Kendall one of the first to reach the scene weights above ground for a supervisor to report we went from message to come back to say that little going home all week he may need a bit of equipment.
Musician Ron Lipsius arrives at the station on one of those trains we noticed these two.
Man I don't think they were in uniform and they were blocking physically blocking entrance to the wooden escalators on our left which are the ones that directly go to Piccadilly train so we thought oh that's strange and.
Is actually tiny bit hazy.
In there too we noticed that too.
Little bit Smokey.
Fireman'S see a small fire burning about halfway up one of the escalators bringing passengers from the tracks up to the ticket hall.
But firefighter Colin towns a spot something he believes it's dangerous because firefighters above ground asking for more equipment than saying people are in danger Caesar is experiencing something going on about the phone around the far away every could see he knew that something bad was about to happen.
On the train platform below passengers are now being urged to get out.
The quickest escape route is up another bank of escalators near the fire these two leads directly to the ticket hall as soon as we got near the top we noticed it was really dark.
But the warning comes too late.
As soon as I went through that terrible stuff in some kind of explosion.
Searing flames rip up the escalator and into the ticket hall incinerating everything in their path.
They were like these living things in up in the corner by the ceiling and there were huge and awesome and I just took one look at that thing and and I.
Schoenberg is a virtually instantaneous spread the fire everything flammable ignite simultaneously.
Firefighters tried desperately to get inside the station but driven back by the intense heat and smoke.
Ron Lipsius tumbles into the chaos outside and for the first time realizes he is badly burned.
Hanging down like for like one estimate sheds its skin.
Firefighters battled the blaze for an hour when it is finally out thirty one people are dead and more than seventy others are injured among the dead is firefighter Colin towns.
The king's cross station to shut down the London Underground is crippled thousands of computers are stranded through the smoky haze of the ruins a mystery emerges why did the fire the size of a cardboard box exploded into a deadly inferno in a matter of seconds.
In the hours following the deadly king's cross fire investigators from England's health and safety executive sifted through the charred station looking for clues.
But finding them in the ruins ticket holes and tunnels wasn't easy.
There'S nothing quite like seeing a fire seen firsthand to give you a full appreciation of the devastation that has taken place and also to give you a feel for how the farm by two developed.
They needed to answer two critical questions what sparked the fire and how could appear so suddenly and erupt into a fatal blaze that claimed thirty one lives.
Nearly a million people relied on the underground each day they needed to know if the system was safe.
This is the stuff of nightmares being trapped by fire on the ground for me it really is something that tugs at the heartstrings will play London's he was on the front pages of references I profusely for several days and there was an enormous two moms find out why it happened investigators started where the flames were first spotted the escalator this was the lowest point of the fire indicating the fire had started there and burned upwards.
You know excel orange or other indications of arson were found.
Underneath the escalator investigators found accumulated grease litter and debris ideal fuel for starting a fire.
They also found evidence of many previous small fires started by smoldering matches and cigarettes.
The actual source of ignition is soon to be a dropped match which had not been extinguished then come in contact with the grease on the running track of the escalator the priest would replace it very very easily.
Investigators speculated that someone on the escalator lit a cigarette and carelessly tossed away a burning match.
Could one match because such a deadly fire they tried dropping matches from Heinz they found a match would be able to in certain circumstances to light the grease on the escalator but in the past the fire was slow burning and didn't explode up the escalator it was all sorts of theories as to how this could have happened so fast and amongst those theories everyone was desperately searching for the truth.
Meanwhile journalists uncovered dozens of previous escalator fires in the London Underground.
After a fire two years earlier at another station investigators said the system's aging wooden escalators were a disaster waiting to happen.
But why did this fire turned into a deadly inferno there was a lot of films about lately the transaction finding the flames because it was extremely clear whenever trying things that station the smoke that was billowing out of the the subways reliable would increase.
What measurements of air flow in the escalator area showed this would not affect a small fire on the steps other theories blame the varnish on the wooden escalator and multiple layers of paint on the ceiling.
The examples of fires in old buildings in the UK which have been painted regularly a free.
Three or four years in these buildings are a hundred years old and if the pain becomes involved it becomes a concern very very quickly because paint the laminate blisters and burns rapidly.
When they did some tests when the agency do some tests on the same page some of that that was not damaged they couldn't make the flames spread fast enough along it and that's when they started to question what else could be the main field and that's when they came to talk to us to see if we could do anything to help what do you think.
Investigators now turn to a team of forensic mathematicians at the investigative firm of CFX.
Their goal was to create a computer simulation of the deadly fire using computational fluid dynamics or CFT.
This was the first time that would be applied to the behavior of fire.
But they believed it would work because heat and air flow like fluid.
Could solve the mystery of the king's cross fire.
To recreate the deadly king's cross fire in a virtual world the station was measured and mapped onto a computer.
The result showed something unusual according to the computer model the king's cross fire had literally defied the laws of physics.
The hot air around the fire did not rise instead it clung to the steps.
We saw that the hottest essentially lying down in the escalated trench which was unexpected to me anyway and the other people from HSE who came to look at those early simulations I think the initial reaction was it was possible that I called gravity upside down which you can do in the computer so maybe I'd make things go the wrong way was it a human error could we have input the dating correctly.
Could there be a bug in the program.
Investigators entered all the data again the results were the same.
Do the checking internal ones and and still found that the hottest day was lying down in the trench eventually spotting up of the ceiling potentially lying down in the trench.
It was a startling significant.
The hot air and gases should have risen up to the ceiling but the escalator stair way appeared to channel them into the ticket hall and that made a stop to think about maybe the water the escalate to could be the main field if the flames are lying down in the trench that pre heating the wood head of the main flame front and that full what once it gets going it could move very very rapidly.
They called what they saw.
But it was merely a.
Using on tested computer simulations and it was inconsistent with typical fire behavior if you have a fire burning in the open on a flat surface.
The father feeds itself.
But on an incline that air flow is restricted on the up hill side.
To examine this a rough model one tenth the size of the escalator shaft was placed flat on the ground the result was a slow vertical burn.
But at a thirty degree angle the angle of the Kings Cross escalator the flames leaned into the shaft at an angle and raced upwards in the confined trench the fire could only draw air from below creating a draft.
Investigators then ran a bigger test on a one third size model of the complete king's cross station.
If the trench affect work this time it would prove their theory was right.
It was clear that the previously unknown phenomenon called the trench effect was real.
I'M sad now we understand you need an explanation of what it is it's now a lobbyist it fits together the jigsaw fits together.
The investigative team now head.
Evidence that would reveal the deadly sequence of events.
Four months a government inquiry into the disaster at the king's cross station fire had struggled to find out how a small fire had exploded so quickly and killed thirty one people.
Now a team of forensic experts said new computer technology provided the answers.
The computer graphics helps us to understand what is taking place and also to present the results to people who were maybe not as familiar with the technology that we were using so we can explain the results to them very simply.
Sometime around seven fifteen PM.
A smoker at Kings Cross carelessly dropped the match on the wooden escalator.
The match fell between the steps on the side of the escalator into the gear bands below it was lined with years of grease and debris.
The slow burning fire began at seven thirty PM.
Flames became visible and underground staff called the fire brigade.
At seven forty PM to farm and saw the low lying flames and at first assumed it could be easily extinguished the foreman who was walking down escalation number six and looked across to escalation number for approximately one minute before flashover described the fight as being relatively small.
But then the fire spread across the steps the bottom of the trench it could only draw oxygen from one direction from below.
This was the French effect.
The flames were deflected into the trench and began to flow up the.
Residents the risers and exposing the balustrades to very high levels of heat flux they just switches and flips over to stick to the floor all the escalated trench from there it pre heats the wood the hot gases are going up the escalator change ahead of the flame to heating the woods quite considerably gets quite hot even though there's no flame that sucking up the F. and below like a chimney which is what it needs to do and that would tend to flatten the flames down in the early stages as well which would stop this effect off the trenches package.
The escalator trench acted as a chimney made not of brick but of highly flammable wood at seven forty five a torrent of superheated gas rushed up the escalator finding everything in its path to burn.
The hot gases in flames into the ticket halls feeding off the years of the paint on the walls and three tons of varnished wood on the escalator below.
Cavernous room was a death trap.
To what extent it quickly and if there's anything there's any comfort there is the comfort that they didn't suffer from very very long until they've taken extremely quickly.
He could have prevented this.
On the grounds.
To ensure such a tragedy would never happen again.
All wooden escalators were eventually removed from the system.
Flammable grease and debris are regularly removed from beneath escalators and the underground staff is now required to be trained in fire evacuation procedures.
Those directly affected by the fire can take some comfort that science explained the mystery that changed their lives.
I was having my life was going certain wireless.
Perfectly happy with it.
I got onto a different life.
I'M not saying it's not safe because I believe it's far safer now than in the walls from the press to.
Those who solved the mystery of the king's cross fire no they are intensive efforts will help save lives.
There'S also a plaque in the booking hall to the memory of the people that died that.
Often just stop that stand and read it and to spend a quiet moment of reflection because there was a human tragedy that sometimes is difficult so I feel strange going back there and and a little ship.
I enjoyed seeing the computer model to be used in a way that was good.
I understand what happened and therefore try prevent it happening again it's opened a whole new line of study on flame spread that perhaps we've taken much longer to to achieve.
If we hadn't had the experience of Kings Cross.
