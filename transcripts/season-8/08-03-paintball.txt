She was home alone making the dress she planned to wear on a Friday night date.
But she had an uninvited visitor.
It took twenty four years before forensic science could identify the individual who was there at that fateful night.
It was nineteen sixty two president John F. Kennedy was leading the country at the height of the Cold War.
The world anxiously watched as the United States confronted the Soviet Union over suspected missile sites in Cuba.
Weather probably contain cargos of offensive weapons be turned back.
Racial tensions in the United States weren't as easily deflected desegregation of southern schools blacks against whites.
Leaders like Martin Luther king junior articulated a message of hope and reason.
Hundreds of miles away in the small town of Hanford California racial tension and the arms race were less important than tending to business and making ends meet.
A small community everybody knew everybody else first name basis even all the races were all friendly.
The Miller family provided an important service to the community they manage the water that was supplied to area farms.
Very neat family hard worker Christian people.
So the millers are quite well known.
Canal was located behind their home.
And someone from the Miller family was always there to make sure the water system work properly.
On March twenty first nineteen sixty two.
Fifteen year old Marlene was the one to stay home while her parents left for a night out.
Marlene plan to finish sewing a new dress for an upcoming date.
Her parents returned home around ten PM.
The television set.
The screen was missing from the bedroom window and there was no sign of their daughter.
Deputy sheriff or mac far lane was one of the first to arrive on the scene.
It was obvious that we had a problem she was in fact missing and there was some foul play somewhere.
Police found tire tracks on the dirt road near the home and there was other evidence there was a sort of boot tracks leading out on to elder Avenue from the dirt lane.
And which got in and out of the car that was parked.
Nearby police discovered a pair of mismatched workman's gloves and a belt.
Robert good was the first journalist on the scene covering the story for the Fresno bee newspaper.
He found more than a story.
After walking down the back a ways I walked a hundred hundred fifty feet down at the bank and there she was.
Marlene was floating face down in the reservoir behind the family home.
Marlene'S brother walked the searching the area in a police helicopter.
The autopsy revealed Marlene had been stabbed in the chest although the wound was not fatal.
There was water in her lungs so the cause of death was drowning.
Marlene'S wrists were tied behind her back with the not used by most area dairy farmers and it had this little not in it it was something you could do very quickly and.
Keep council K. there were no signs of sexual assault.
The bruises on the body suggested Marlene bravely fought her attacker.
In a search for witnesses.
One of my leaves high school classmates told police he saw a strange car near Marlene's house around the time of her murder he said it was an awkward tight blue fender he'll like to paint on the car black on the hood and black on the top and black clear down the trunk high school kid to kind of.
Fifty three Plymouth look pretty good too I.
Police had tire impressions at the crime scene and a description of the car.
Now all they had to do was find it.
A witness saw a nineteen fifty three black and turquoise Plymouth park near Marlene Miller's home on the night of her murder.
Within hours police found it.
Remember him for police department came up with a car of that description pardon from the royal hotel in downtown Hanford on seventh street.
When deputy sheriff McFarlane peered inside the rear window he saw what would later become a crucial piece of evidence I could see a pair of boots back there one was sitting flat the other was on its side and with a flashlight I can see that the trend looks to me like the same trend that was out there in toluene.
The car was registered to Booker T. Hillary junior a local dairy worker who had recently been released from prison for a previous rape conviction.
One of his coworkers told police that he saw Hillary driving towards Marlene Miller's home after work on the night of her murder.
And Hillary's employer identified the gloves found at the crime scene as the ones Hillary war.
The tires on Hillary's car and the boots found in the backseat were similar to the tire and boot impressions in the soft mud near the crime scene.
But that doesn't mean that he killed her even though the gloves for pitch count.
Down the road where the car tracks and.
That look like he has went so everything was circumstantial it was no real evidence to put him in the whole.
Booker Hillary denied any involvement in Marlene's murder.
Hillary said he drove by the members home every day since he worked at the dairy farm just down the road he said his tire and shoe impressions in the area meant nothing.
Booker Hillary was arrested tried and convicted of Marlene millers merger he was sentenced to death.
Once in prison Hillary took full advantage of the appellate process and petition to have his conviction overturned it was discouraging especially for the family that had to constantly re live this nightmare every time this case would come up.
Go through this process.
Yeah the engine they just keep coming.
Sometimes a criminal justice system to a police officer is frustrating.
Every appeal Hillary filed was unsuccessful.
But in nineteen seventy four the United States Supreme Court ruled the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment.
As a result the sentences of everyone on death row including Booker Hillary were commuted to life in prison.
The Supreme Court reversed their decision two years later but the commuted death sentences couldn't be reinstated.
Booker Hillary's legal maneuvering continued.
Peeled his conviction once again this time claiming that blacks had been excluded from the grand jury that indicted.
In nineteen eighty three a judge granted that appeal and ordered Hillary either to be re tried or released.
What is disturbing about it is that this was in nineteen eighty three the conviction occurred in nineteen sixty two and anyone can review the transcripts of the grand jury hearing and determine that you know no matter what race you are you will find probable cause.
I knew that I had to find out exactly what proof I needed because I obviously had to retry this case and I agree we tried twenty four years after the first condition.
The physical evidence still existed but twenty one of the original witnesses were now dead.
Larry orth was the chief investigator for the Kings County DA's office.
Or dead in the city I have to read hundreds of pages of testimony from nineteen sixty to sixty five nineteen seventy into into a record.
Can almost put to sleep.
So investigators took the physical evidence and looked at it again this time with some new forensic techniques not previously available and found a surprise.
It had been twenty four years since Booker T. Hillary was first convicted of Marlene mother's murder conviction later overturned on appeal.
Criminalist Gary Courtney examine the physical evidence from the first trial.
He started with the bullets found in Booker Hillary's car on the night of the murder.
The boots had been modified the souls with the originals from the Wellington boot company the original white heel had been replaced with the black one.
Almost an individual shoes out of it because the two different components.
Now compared to Hillary's boats to the shoe impression found near Marlene Miller's home they had the same soul the same custom he'll and the same five individual copy marks in the heels.
Next quarter compared the tires from Hillary's car to the tire impressions found on the dirt road near the mother's home.
Looking for cuts or rocks or anything that had been in the tires in this case we're very lucky because there was a manufacturer's defect that was picked up and there were three cuts in the tires were close.
This place Booker Hillary in the vicinity of the crime scene but not inside the home.
Larry or found something important while reading through the transcripts from the first trial.
On the night of the murder twenty four years earlier and alert detective asked Marlene's mother to vacuum the carpet in the living room where her daughter was abducted.
At that time investigators found some unusual microscopic particles in that trace evidence but they didn't know what they were.
They said they didn't have the technology to do it other than just to compare him as far as shape size and that was it.
The football shaped particles found in the vacuum cleaner bag still existed in the evidence files and were sent for analysis to an independent forensic lab in Chicago.
Skip the neck was the forensic microscopist assigned to the case.
Having done microscopy since I was eight years old I'd seen particles like this before and I knew what kinds of of physical phenomena produce this.
Under magnification of three hundred times.
Hello Nick recognized the particles as.
Through all the particles were cotton fibers this explains why the paint particles were around.
When pain is sprayed from an aerosol can the round particles flatten when they hit a surface like wood.
When the paint dries it creates a film like covering.
But if the spray paint hits a fiber it reacts differently if these spheres drive around nothing they just retain that ship as their spheres however if they come in contact with the fiber then what happens is capillary forces because the the ends of the sphere which starts out like this to draw where they come in contact with the fiber.
Scientists performed an electron probe micro analysis to identify the elements in the paint.
Every element that's in there has its own X. rays to come off their different wavelengths and we collect these different X. rays at different wavelengths are different energies and from their energy or the wave like we can tell what elements are present in the sample.
The components were titanium lead and dire and.
And then for red micro spectra photometer which looks more like a computer than a microscope determines the paints molecular composition.
The results are charted on a graph and scientists learned that the painting was an oil based adult kit with the Prussian blue pigment.
Investigators now wanted to know where these mysterious microscopic blue paint particles came from.
And they also needed to know how they got on the Marlene Miller is living room carpet twenty four years earlier.
As prosecutors prepared to re try a Booker T. Hillary for the murder of Marlene Miller they discovered new forensic evidence microscopic particles in the victim's home in case in cotton.
But in nineteen sixty two at the time of the original trial the technology to identify these particles didn't exist.
But where did these paint balls come from.
For answers investigators looked once more inside Booker Hillary's nineteen fifty three Plymouth automobile surprisingly it was still in police custody after all those years.
In the forensic lab scientist noticed that the ceiling of the passenger compartment was lined with the cotton material.
And the material had been painted with the blue spray paint.
Pulling some of the headliner often examine it hello the microscope I realize that there are millions of these things that have been manufactured by him in spring that line and when they were still there it's kind of like they were there for someone to find and I was lucky enough to be found.
Scientists vacuum the inside of Hillary's car and analyzed the trace evidence they found thousands of paint particles identical in color shape and chemical make up to those found in Marlene Miller's home at the end of all this analysis what we have our first wall green page here's the paint is out to the national it's a simple question and no one has the same color when you crush up little bits under the microscope they show the same kinds of crystal filler crystalline fillers that are inside the elemental composition is identical the infrared spectrum from molecular composition is identical they're both use Prussian blue we couldn't say that you know came from Assange break Kansas St how did they get there they're so unusual in shape why are they in both places.
Investigators suspected that Booker Hillary spray painted the interior roof of his car as he did the rounds take particles attached to the cotton fibers and remained cylindrical as they dry.
Driving around town when Hillary hit a bump in the road the microscopic particles shed landing on his clothing and in his hair.
Prosecutors believe that when Hillary entered Marlene's home on the night of the murder those microscopic particles dropped on to the mother's living room floor.
The became literally a walking trace evidence factory.
This evidence placed Booker Hillary inside Marlene's home with everything else outside in a tenth of a mile away but the paintballs put him in the house that's how important man.
In nineteen eighty six based on this new forensic evidence Booker T. Hillary was tried and convicted once again for the murder of fifteen year old Marlene Miller.
He was sentenced to the maximum penalty allowed twenty five years to life.
So the judge made it clear that he would have imposed the death penalty if he had been permitted by law to do so.
Ironically it was Booker Hillary himself who handed investigators the forensic evidence used to convict him.
Local authorities had tried to sell his car shortly after his first conviction in the nineteen sixties but Hillary wouldn't allow it.
In turn filed a motion in federal court so in the county to stop them from getting rid of the car.
He dismissed the case so we decided not to sell it.
A one I looked up that day in the garage and having seen that spray headliner was just indescribable I said this is it any of not say the car for us.
I'Ll never know where these particles came from.
Today Booker Hillary is seventy one years old he was denied parole at his most recent hearing in January two thousand three.
Booker hilarious story belongs he should have been in the gas chamber before this but.
For whatever reason he he you.
The system didn't take his life but he is where he belongs he does not belong back out in society.
Investigators credit the foresight of the late Martin Thomas the kings county chief criminal deputy who in nineteen sixty two insisted that Marlene's mother vacuum the living room floor where the abduction took place.
He kept that trace evidence in police custody.
That was the key to it and I know art knew that was a key to putting them in the house that he was an investigator and he was a damn good job.
We cannot do what some people think can only be done in the works of fiction we are I believe that's what the living embodiment of a Sherlock Holmes and Dr Thorndyke and some of these kinds of people and that we can take this little speck of evidence and literally make it speak.
