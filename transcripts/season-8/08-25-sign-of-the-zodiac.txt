For six years a serial killer prowl the streets of New York City hunting his victims.
He promised to kill twelve people one for each astrological sign and the only struck while certain constellations were visible.
It took forensic astronomy handwriting analysis and the World War two codebreaker defined.
Late one cold night in March nineteen ninety forty nine year old Mario Racicot was walking home from his restaurant job in Brooklyn.
Without warning he was shot in the back.
Florio'S survived but he couldn't describe his attacker.
Three weeks later there was a similar incident a few blocks away.
Thirty four year old factory worker from on mountain H. Rowe was walking home after a serious night of drinking when someone shot him in the back.
To survive but he didn't see the gunman either.
Police recovered the nine millimeter bullet.
They wore no clothes on the bullets and we're probably dealing with the zip gun.
type of homemade weapon.
Two months later a short distance away in queens seventy eight year old Joe pro she was about to open the door to his apartment when he was shot with a nine millimeter is it done.
Protein died later at the hospital this time the killer left a note beside the victim.
It was a threat to kill twelve people one for each astrological sign of the zodiac.
The next day a similar note arrived at the offices of the New York Post newspaper.
It was so crazy there was this wheel with signs of the zodiac in this one it was unusual it was a little different mostly just scribbled lunacy and this guy was organized he's got this chart and it was bizarre.
The Saudi act claimed responsibility for the three shootings but he mistakenly believed that he had killed all three it was apparent the zodiac knew his victims birthdays and astrological signs.
Roscoe was a Scorpio.
But how did this so the act the victim's astrological sign.
Are you kidding it freaked them out completely.
The New York City police department went into the biggest man it was mammoth and it was driving him crazy.
At this point investigators realized the Sodi act had contacted them before they just didn't.
Three months earlier he had written a letter to police headquarters but it was ignored.
And basically it was viewed humorously here's another letter I believe was posted on a bulletin board it was not taken very seriously.
This letter held yet another clue.
An astrologer told police that the constellations Orion and the seven sisters of the Pleiades were not visible on the nights of the shootings the zodiacs letter implied he wouldn't strike when Ryan and the seven sisters were in the sky.
The signs all over the newspaper now I mean this guy's claiming zodiac so now this thing is really hot potato it's.
Biggest case in years in New York City.
Twenty five years earlier a man in San Francisco killed six people and road taunting letters to police he to call himself the zodiac and was never apprehended.
Was it possible the San Francisco zodiac was now in New York City.
If the zodiac from California the sixties had resurfaced in New York they knew this is a complete law enforcement Hey there.
New York City police were searching for a killer who called himself the zodiac.
He promised to kill one victim for each of the twelve astrological sign.
Before this yeah killer in New York when the guy said to a girl what's your sign he was hitting up afterwards I mean it was literally a case where a guy asked a girl sign and she screamed for the police.
I am writing experts compared to New York so the act letters to those written by San Francisco so the act killer twenty five years earlier.
One characteristic of this writer is that he makes is horizontal lines in a descending way this T. bars tend to descend the cross bar on his lower case EFS tend to descend.
Handwriting experts concluded that the San Francisco so the act and the new York so deac we're two different man.
Investigators now realized they were dealing with a very sophisticated copy cat.
The shootings had taken place at twenty one and sixty three day intervals suggesting variations of the three week cycle.
And they happened on nights when the constellations Ryan and the seven sisters of the Pleiades were not visible in the sky.
So these are powerful ideas he's a powerful symbol to predict when the zodiac would strike next police asked astronomer Gregory mac bluff to identify the next time within the twenty one day cycle that Ryan and the seven sisters would not be in the sky.
He did so by consulting his astrological charts.
I just don't think this is the time of day and in some cases location your latitude you can see what is rising and want to set.
So the act would strike next on June twenty first the summer solstice the longest day of the year.
So we have hundreds of plainclothes detectives out on nights when we think this guy's gonna shoot again.
And those are the act was even more clever than anticipated he did strike.
Not in the same area as before.
This time it was in Manhattan.
He shot a homeless man Larry Parham was sleeping on a bench in Central Park.
In the victim shoe was a note.
The zodiac somehow knew that Larry Parham was a cancer assign different from the other three victims.
And zodiac registered his indignation that the newspapers were calling him a copy cat.
He is angry he's trying to convince us no no I'm I'm zodiac's ones only act and.
To look for forensic evidence criminalist saturated the letter within hydrant chemical that reacts with the amino acids from skin or.
Then the letter was placed in a humidity chamber for several hours.
The moisture in the chamber xcelerated the chemical process eventually revealing an almost perfect.
This was photographed and then compared to prince in every fingerprint database available.
They did databases for city employees are motor vehicles postal workers and they were going through those databases including police officers every police officer in new York's fingerprints were compared to the zodiacs believe me they tried it and.
There had been no witnesses none of the surviving victims could give a description and the only forensic evidence was a single finger print.
So the act claimed that only the constellations Ryan and the seven sisters could stop him.
New York police hope to add themselves to the list.
The zodiac killed one man and wounded three others in New York City and for some unexplained reason he struck only on nights when the constellations Ryan and the seven sisters were not in the sky.
Just as unusual was the fact that he apparently knew with the birthdays of all four of his victims.
And it was clear from the zodiac's letters that he was following the investigation in the newspaper.
I printed a story but the police had his fingerprints he messed up and I'm convinced as soon as he saw that.
You know he he he folded his tent because he knew that one said fingerprints at that comparison he was cooked.
And for almost two years there were no more so the action takes.
It wasn't until nineteen ninety four but the Saudi accent is next letter announcing his return.
The zodiac claimed responsibility for the stabbing death of thirty nine year old Patricia Fonti in Highland Park but Tricia was the Leo.
And forty year old Joseph dia Kong was shot and killed while he was walking near this highway underpass Joseph was a Virgo.
The ball it was a through and through wound which severed his carotid artery and he bled to death there within moments certainly.
So the X. next victim forty year old James Weber was shot in the same location he was a libra and fortunately he survived the attack.
Snuck up behind them given the warning.
Amazingly HM so D. X. seven victims had that different astrological sign.
But the pattern stopped with his eight forty year old Diane Ballard who also survived the shooting was a Taurus.
The same sign as an earlier victim.
Zodiac also took credit for shooting on nine th man in Highland Park although police couldn't confirm the shooting took place.
One of his last remarks in each of those letters he actually says no rooms and that those are the ballistic identifiers that ordinarily most examinations and comparisons are made by in the field the ballistics.
Although the zodiac bragged that police would never catch him with this letter he made a mistake.
He licked the envelope flap and left enough saliva for DNA testing.
Police now had the DNA profile of the zodiac killer.
The letter also included another clue.
I just I knew was a code is a nine towers because there were nine victims and I wrote down all the different symbols I think I had twenty three.
Post to an alphabet and then I did something called a frequency count which is you you.
A down how many times each letter is used because for example he is the most commonly used letter in the alphabet.
Crowley'S father in law had been a code breaker in World War two.
Together they discovered that the alphabet was based on a maritime system of international flags independence.
And with this discovery they were able to decipher the so the axe secret message.
It said this is the zodiac speaking I am in control.
Cool mastery the ready for more.
Disodium killer had been walking in the dark deserted streets of New York City undetected for six years.
Captain Joseph Herbert worked on the zodiac task force and he knew that eventually the forensic evidence would catch in.
Police continue to search for the zodiac on a dark dreary March afternoon in nineteen ninety six their luck began to change.
Open the door a young man in a Brooklyn apartment apparently got angry because his younger sister and her boyfriend were together alone in her bedroom.
Amanda the boyfriend lied when they refused he fired a shot through the bedroom door.
When the woman ran out to confront her brother shot the budgets for the shot.
The police arrive to discover the man was holding his sister's boyfriend hostage.
behind one sided though he's on the other side of the I'm talking to him and I'm trying to articulate to him that enough damage has been done at about three hours he indicated to me that he wanted to cement.
but convinced him to put all of his weapons in buckets police lowered from the roof to his apartment window and he surrendered.
His name was Eddie say a twenty six year old high school drop out unemployed who is still living at home with his mother and younger sister.
One day she seem religious and quiet and shy and strange and other days he seemed aggressive and scary.
At headquarters police casts a debt to provide a written statement describing what happened inside his apartment.
Say to comply.
And when finished he signed it with an odd symbol next to its name.
What'S this and he said that that was a symbol for god and god's love for something.
And alert police officer asked hostage negotiator Joseph her but to have a look.
burden you immediately.
He was looking.
To prove their suspicions police turned to forensic science.
First it was fingerprinted.
Its prince were then compared with the print left on the letter in Central Park.
It was a match.
Next handwriting experts compared the handwriting from the zodiac's letters to say this known handwriting samples.
The experts concluded they were written by the same.
Ballistics experts examine status collection of fifteen zip guns.
In his letters zodiac claimed no one would catch him because his gun barrel didn't have the traditional lands and grooves inside for testing.
But the zodiac apparently didn't know about forensic tool mark analysis.
A. two mark is a characteristic left behind during the process of using a tool to to cut grind file for Polish a piece of metal.
There can be hundreds of microscopic tool marks in a pipe used in a homemade gun.
When ballistics experts compared the bullets from the victims to those fired from say the zip gun.
Tool marks were microscopically similar.
Finally police asked say there for a blood sample for DNA testing.
His DNA matched the saliva on the envelope flap of the zodiac letters.
Detectives sever Reese had the pleasure of telling say to a new his true identity.
Look if you for six years and I said you're the zodiac.
That was beginning of you six seven hour interrogation on the subject shootings until finally to give it up it took offense to it.
You want to go to jail for simply shooting a system in the body with a with a shot gun.
He wanted to take credit for is.
In one of his first letter is already explained that only a Ryan and the seven sisters could stop.
Ironically on the day of his sister shooting for Ryan and the seven sisters were over hand they just weren't visible in the overcast sky.
Eddie Saito was charged with shooting six people and killing three others.
Prosecutors had so much forensic evidence they had a hard time deciding how to hold the jury centrist we weren't certain that the public at large would be as interested in all of this forensic evidence and we were curious about how the jury would receive it and ultimately we we ultimately set aside a week that we just referred to as forensic week were shocked to see the jury sat on the edge of their seats.
And I just remember one morning sitting there sifting through the guns and the knives whatever it was that day and looking at it and just at that moment being struck by like wow what I can do with this stuff if the the ballistics you've got to fingerprint the fingerprint it got to him right he began writing you've got the state in the one St then you've got another state all those forensic entities came back to haunt eighty big time.
Eddie say that was convicted and sentenced to two hundred thirty two years in prison.
And he said it was a cat with he attacked his victim from the vehicle he shot them for no reason other than that he could.
One question remains how did say he didn't know his victim's birthday.
Some speculate that he looked inside his victim's wallet after each.
And that all had different astrological signs due to nothing more than a lot.
