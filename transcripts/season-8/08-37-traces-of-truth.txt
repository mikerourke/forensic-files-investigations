Popular high school gym teacher mysteriously left town without saying goodbye to anyone.
He later sent letters to explain why.
But a closer forensic look at those letters and a microscopic piece of tissue gave investigators and an early different explanation for where he went and why.
West Yellowstone Montana is primarily a resort town only one thousand residents live here year round.
But in season the beauty of the National Forest lands and Yellowstone National Park are the main draw.
What else does basically the gateway to Yellowstone National Park there's a million plus visitors who come through here every year so it's a service oriented town.
Rainy and Brad Brisbane owned a restaurant in town.
Read also worked as a gym teacher at the local high school.
Brad was fun loving and enjoying life he loved to play practical jokes on people Brad was a very loyal.
Honest trustworthy friend who would do anything including give you the shirt off his back to help you.
Friday November ninth nineteen ninety started like most days until Brad got a telephone call at work and left class unexpectedly I actually met in the hall and his jacket on he was getting ready to leave I asked where he was going he just said to help out a friend and I had brought in the substitute for the P. class he said he would see me at dinner later on that night.
Brad said he was going to Belgrade about ninety miles away to pick up his friend Larry Moore who needed a ride it was I mean he doesn't leave them be honest you shop for very much.
What made it even more bizarre.
I had never returned home.
That'S when we knew something I mean we knew something was already wrong because Brad and come home and that wasn't his nature that wasn't the way Brad Brisbane was.
When police interviewed Larry Moore he said he met Brad at the diner as planned.
But he said Brad was depressed and inebriated.
Read to learn that he was tired of life Darby's wife turned to the restaurant was going to leave borrow some money from him.
Left the restaurant.
Moore said Brad left the diner got into a red car with Washington plates and drove off.
Moore said the driver was a woman and that he didn't recognize her.
And there were no signs of foul play he loved his family there was no problem you were never really any indication that it was anything in his name mine will remotely related to leaving his family.
I knew that they didn't know our family then dynamics of the family and.
Just to hear people saying well you know maybe he did just run off they didn't know.
The Brisbane and more families have been friends for years.
Larry'S wife Shelly worked with Brad.
Chile coach the girls high school basketball team and brand coached the boys.
Investigators heard rumors that Brad and Shelley were having an affair I don't believe so we talked to rainy she didn't think there were some of her we talked to Shelly and she denied one of the only other person that could really save was missing.
Shelley and Larry more separated just two days before Brad disappeared.
Charlie said her alleged affair with Brad was a figment of Larry's imagination I truly believe he thought we were having an affair she actually pointed to Larry as as possibly having done something to read because of some of the domestic violence against terror and the fact that he had accused her of having an affair with.
A few weeks after Brad's disappearance a letter from Brad arrived at police headquarters.
He said he was alive and well and living in Washington state.
But after seeing the letter.
The last known person to see Brad Bridgeman alive was his friend Larry Moore.
Police started their investigation by carefully examining Larry Moore struck.
Inside the camper investigators found bullet holes in the floor and in the liner underneath.
They also found a bullet fragment from a three fifty seven magnum pistol.
Larry told police he once tried shooting a mouse in the camper while on a hunting trip.
But something caught the eyes of investigators a small piece of what appeared to be tissue on a window curtain.
About the size of a quarter there's no way to describe it doesn't look like a piece of.
chicken skin or something like that being unsure what it might be he took that.
The entire curtain what did the tissue on it and we got it set up to the missile a state crime lab.
I'M not lonely test identified the tissue as human and the striations meant it was muscle.
But that doesn't show you that the person's debt we can all deposit muscle tissue and still be very much a lot.
But before police could question Larry more about this forensic discovery a letter arrived postmarked from Spokane Washington.
It was from Brad Brisbane.
In it he apologized for creating what he called a real strain on everyone involved.
I'Ve decided to start a new life for myself I had to make a clean break from everyone and everything to make this work it just seemed to be the only way out.
Fortunately I have a wonderful woman to help me.
A few days later Larry Moore received a similar letter.
In this one Brad wanted to make sure his wife Renate was taken care off.
All personal property we own I want her to have everything.
I'M starting a new life with a new person.
But investigators noticed a slight problem.
The name of Brad's wife Renate was misspelled.
The letter to the shaft and congratulated him to his appointment and the sheriff is an elected position so they were huge mistakes they were they were just huge red flags.
Investigators tested the letters with the hydrant a chemical solution that reacts with the amino acids in fingerprints.
After it was applied the documents were dried thoroughly.
Scientists found numerous fingerprints on the two documents but none match Brad Brisbane they weren't Larry Morris fingerprints either.
Next the letters were analyzed by a forensic document examiner.
Both letters were type with the same type writer the paper was inexpensive the kind often used in high schools.
The type showed no defects making it difficult to identify the typewriter used to create them.
And only the signature was hand written.
The signature itself is a full course of signature it is full of tremor it looks labored and it looks slow.
And it does not look like it is the the product of a virtual movement.
The disease could be drugs could even be stress and you get that tremor when somebody sits down and tries to duplicate the handwriting of another person.
Experts compared this question signature to several documents Brad signed shortly before his disappearance.
The handwriting sample I saw for bread Brisbane was a greeting card and he wrote a short note at the bottom and signed Brad is hand writing was done all in upper case.
Capitals it was printed in essence all the printed capitals were connected it was sort of printed capitals and cursive mixed together it's a very high level spirited handwriting very bold handwriting fast fluid burst very much from the hip.
Questions signature was quite different.
The upper case B. in the name Brad was actually constructed in three pieces there is a a break it has the up and down spine on the left side of the letter but between the top in the bottom of the letter there's a break interesting at the break is in a place where you would naturally stop if you wanted to look to see how you were doing and continue writing.
Police suspected Larry Moore may have written the letters but it was difficult to tell since the question signature wasn't actually hand writing.
This is a drawing of somebody's signature it's not hand writing at all and it's very difficult sometimes to actually determine who it was that made the drawing.
Although document examiners were unable to tell conclusively who signed the letter they were certain it wasn't brand Brisbane I knew that the letter was completely false there's absolutely no way.
And that my father was.
Investigators still had no idea where Brad Brisbane was or what may have happened to him.
Police now on you but the letters mail from Spokane Washington weren't written by Brad Brisbane they strongly suspected Larry Moore may have been involved in Brad's disappearance.
On the step of Moore's camper police noticed what looked like blood spatter.
Under a microscope scientists found it was more than just blood.
It was tissue.
This was identified as human.
And the sample had both small granular cells and larger can just sales this meant only one thing.
This was muscle.
But they wanted a second opinion.
The cerebellum sits at the base of the brain and is primarily responsible for memory and motor movement.
Since the cerebellum controls the heart muscle no human can survive without.
A ballistics expert compared the location of the brain tissue in the camper with the bullet holes.
Using the two point laser marked the center of the bullet hole and then followed the bullets passed.
It showed that the shooter was firing from a standing position.
Very few people shoot holding the gun up over their head and if you realize the body was interposed in between that.
We'Ve only got a few feet to deal with so it can't be upstanding man for example.
Could be a collapsed manner of person nearly down on the floor.
Next ballistic experts examined the bullet fragments found in the floor of the camper and discovered what is called soft damage.
It deforms in a very different way than it would if it hit wood concrete drywall.
And it slows down the longer the path through a victim more tissue or tissue similar the more velocity is lost.
To find out who's brain tissue was in the camper investigators sent the samples for DNA testing but they didn't have the body to compare it to we can help you to determine whether this tissue is from the missing person by comparing the DNA from the tissue to the family members and the children and the mother of the person is missing.
Children get half of their DNA from the mother and half from the father by taking a DNA sample from Brett's wife his four children and his mother scientists could isolate Brad's DNA profile through a process of elimination.
For this scientists used an RFLP test at the time the most sophisticated DNA test available.
Who'S ever tissue sample that was was completely consistent with being the father of both sets of children.
And consistent with being the son of the mother of the missing person.
Next scientists tested the tiny fragment of brain tissue it was too small for RFLP testing since it was about the size of a pinhead.
So scientists amplified using PCR a process that duplicates a small sample to make it large enough to test.
The PCR DNA tests revealed that the brain tissue in Larry Morse camper was Brad respects I know it's going to be match the official confirmation that the blood matched was huge airplane never felt anything like that before.
With this discovery the medical examiner ruled Brad Brisbane's death a homicide.
Larry Moore was arrested and charged with murder.
Prosecutors knew their case would be difficult to prove without a body.
Prosecutors believe that the motive for Brad Brisbane's murder was jealousy Larry more suspected Brad was having an affair with his wife.
The forensic evidence suggests the two met at the diner and more it somehow lord Brad into the back of his camper.
Once inside Brad was ambushed sure in a second.
Bread was on the floor one more shot from a standing position numerous times.
One shot hit Brad shoulder leaving a piece of muscle another strong bread in the head.
No one heard the shots because it was a busy truck stop with lots of traffic.
Authorities had no way to tell where Moore took the body.
He knows that he's got equipment west Yellowstone he owned an excavating company swept back because that kind of thing so he could get rid of the body pretty easy.
Prosecutors believe more steam clean the camper and remove the carpet to hide the forensic evidence.
But the bullet holes in the tiny specks of muscle and brain tissue convinced medical experts that Brad was dead.
All prosecutors had to do was convince a jury of.
Is a prosecutor clearly you want to make damn sure that this is the right guy in there has been a murder I can't think of anything worse than being in a position of finding out you've convicted the wrong person.
Larry Moore denied killing Brad Brisbane and pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors argued that Larry Moore killed Brad Brisbane in a jealous rage convince Brad was sleeping with his wife Shelly.
To throw investigators off the trail more forage Brad's name on several measures.
The forensic evidence convinced the jurors of two things one.
Read Brisbane was dead.
And to that Larry Moore was his killer.
We the jury find the defendant guilty of the offence.
Moore was sentenced to sixty years in prison.
It was the first murder case in Montana to be tried without a body.
And it was also the first time in the state the DNA was used in a criminal case.
Just two years after his conviction Larry Moore made headlines again.
He was charged with conspiring to build a bomb in prison.
To avoid federal charges more agreed to lead authorities to Brad Brisbane's body.
More directed officials to a campground where he hit the three fifty seven magnum pistol he used in the murder.
It was found at the base of the tree in one of the campgrounds and yelling can and.
Moore also led police to a gravel a few miles outside of west Yellowstone where they on earth to Brad's body.
He didn't tell us anything about the homicide when we did find grads body.
Larry did turn a little pale and go and sit in a vehicle but he never did tell us the real reason or the story behind how it actually happened.
A forensic examination of Brad's body confirmed what forensic scientist told the jury in court two years earlier.
The determine the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds to the head and upper thoracic region otherwise the chest area or the back.
Even though Moore led police to the body and the murder weapon he never confessed until now.
In an exclusive letter to the producers of this program he admitted his guilt I am guilty as charged and I'm thankful that the truth finally came out with the help from modern technology I have learned to tell me the truth is the only answer.
His words bring little comfort to the Brisbane family.
I think the hardest part is been the kids it's not right to have to grow up without a father.
I would love to be in the same room with three more.
And asking me why and get a straight honest answer about why he killed my dad.
I think that's the least he could do to this family.
As a teenager I was.
H. forensic test was a piece of the mosaic and when put together shows clearly what occurred during Brad Brisbane's last moments alive.
Without it we couldn't we can approve that Brad was even dead he would still be a missing person.
