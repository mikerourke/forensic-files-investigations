With no forensic evidence found at the murder scene investigators were baffled.
But they suspected that the victim's dog with the crime.
If she had a forensic scientist needed some way to find out what the dog had seen.
North liberty ia is such a small town it doesn't take much effort to know your neighbors.
One resident the townspeople seldom saw was twenty eight year old John apples.
John was somewhat of a recluse John kind of stayed to himself.
It wasn't unusual if we didn't see him for a month it be doing things said at his home or repairing things are out with his friends at one point in time in John's life he was a narcotics user and very possibly also in a context dealer.
In February of nineteen ninety nine John's mother was really worried she hadn't heard from her son in over two months.
Trying to reach my son and that he wasn't answering and we were afraid something was wrong.
So she called the local sheriff who found John's van parked in his driveway.
But no one answered the door.
They smelled an odor coming from inside the trailer he described that order is being the owner of death.
The officers forced their way through the trailer door and found helpful dead slumped in a chair.
The body appeared to be in a position of someone who had been watching TV and had laid their head down on their arm on their pillow and gone to sleep the body was completely covered I had a blanket over the entire body over the head over all of the body.
He had been shot twice in the back of the head with a twenty two caliber pistol.
The composition revealed the murder happened weeks earlier.
There were no signs of forced entry and the trailer doors were locked.
That indicated to us that someone actually left the residence and took the time to use the key to hold that door shut again keeping other individuals from being able to easily access and enter the trailer.
In the home.
Police found a small amount of marijuana and some drug paraphernalia.
John didn't deserve to have this happen to him you may not have been the perfect person in the world he may not have had the best lifestyle in the world but I could almost guarantee would give you the shirt off his back.
But John is prized collection of guns was missing including a uniquely customized gold Cup forty five semi automatic pistol.
This cold gold Cup was described to me from one of John's friends is you would have to pry that gun away from his cold dead fingers.
He was able to take guns apart more common repair customize some fancy gold on things like that.
It sounded as if John had been killed for the the gun collection.
And another one of John's prized possessions was missing his three year old husky kisha he loved his dog is Douglass's life he she was his baby she had a lot of hamburgers a lot of pizza hot dogs things like that I think she ate mostly people food she was very spoiled.
Police soon learned that a dog matching teaches description was found a month earlier wandering aimlessly several miles away.
She was just down in the middle street days looking around like where am I what am I doing here John's parents identified.
The evidence suggested she had been driven there and dropped off.
Kisha was found during January when the roads are typically dirty and muddy vacations condition was was pretty clean the crime scene showed that the dog's leash which normally was kept inside the trailer next to the door was actually in the victim's van is suggested to the victim's van had been used to transport the dog.
And dispose of the dog.
This was just one on usual detailed investigation that was to become even more bizarre.
An autopsy on twenty eight year old John Heppell revealed he had been killed long before his body was found.
But the medical examiner was unable to determine exactly when he was killed without an idea as to when the time of death is it obviously becomes very much more difficult to determine who are suspects and who are people that you can rule out.
Apple'S dog T. shirt was found on January twenty second.
Apple'S telephone answering machine messages not yet listen to the earliest on heard message was left that same day January twenty second.
John would not use the answer machine to screen his telephone calls if someone called John one to talk to so therefore we knew that January twenty second twenty third.
John was dead.
With this information authorities questioned John's friends and family.
We had three primary suspects in this case Mike Harding Andrew rich and Sharon Snyder.
The first suspect my karting a friend of John Hubbell's a witness recalled seeing Harding's truck parked near apple's home around the time of the murder.
My karting was good friends with John we knew that John and.
And Mike had some narcotics business together.
Harding had an alibi for the time of the murder and he passed a polygraph test.
The next two suspects Andrew Richmond Sherin Schneider were friends of Johns who lived about an eighteen hour drive away in Greybull Wyoming.
We learned from a good friend to saw into rich and John Hipple together on January eighteenth of nineteen ninety nine that in fact I encourage had been at the trailer house of John Hubbell.
But Andy said John was alive and well when he and Sharon left to return home.
Police searched the couple's apartment and found marijuana methamphetamine and several twenty two caliber bullets the same caliber used to kill have all.
These bullets along with the slides from apple's body was sent to the FBI lab for a neutron activation test that's where the lead is shaved off the ball it gets melted down.
And Adams are counted counted then compared the atomic composition of the bullets recovered from John Hubbell was not what investigators had hoped for.
The results showed us that the more that we have recovered from John were not the same ball it's that was removed from Andy riches house in Greybull Wyoming.
Investigators found smudge marks on the inside windows of riches G. similar to those caused by animals when pressing their noses against the glass.
Was it possible that rich used his car to transport Havel's dog across town after the murder.
Police took key shows no sprint in the same way they collect human fingerprints.
Each dog's nose print is as unique as a fingerprint.
Unfortunately we weren't able to get the type of smudges or prince actually from the other vehicle that would enable us to do that but it certainly was an interesting element that we pursued for some time.
After several months with no forensic evidence and very few leads the investigation at the John Hubbell's murder was starting to turn coal.
So investigators turned the Havel's dog for more information.
As it turned out that dog was going to play a very important part and solving Johns data.
A year after John Hubbell's murder police suspected Hubble's best friend Andy rich was somehow involved in his death but they had no proof.
All investigators knew was that rich had some unusual career aspirations.
We knew that his lifelong goal was to be a hit man for the mafia we had interviewed past girlfriends who had interviewed other associates a venue rich.
And he always protect portrayed himself as a tough guy that's that's how anti rich wants to be remembered we were concerned that Sharon Snyder on the girlfriend of the into rich had information that she was fearful about telling us the impression was that she was being guarded out of fear for fear of the internet.
That was a good punching bag for him he appears to me a lot there was a lot of abuse.
Not just physical there was a lot of verbal abuse.
Police looked into Sharon's background to see if she had ever been involved in illegal activity and they found something sure Snyder was purchasing guns a different location she would give those against anti rich some of those guns went to John Hubbell.
We had a violation of federal statute the federal firearms narcotics statute was to wage that we used to split and the rich insurance not.
Sharon told a different story about that visit with John have.
I honestly couldn't live with myself anymore I had to face up to whatever was going to happen to me.
Sharon said she dropped and he offered Havel's home about three days before the merger then left to visit her daughter about an hour's drive away.
They put some of these guns into their car took John's fan to his home and then drove their car back to Wyoming.
I had no idea that John's dad no I had no idea about that have wonders why he had these guns.
After a brief stay in Wyoming Sharon said that and the left alone with the guns.
Took off in the middle of the night around four o'clock in the morning and headed to Texas he was gone three weeks it was the Amazon stupidity for telling me where he was going.
We started to learn things from Sharon that we had suspected all along and at that point in time it became really important for us to find any information that we could that was going to corroborate what Sharon had to say.
Police visited the man and the rate stayed with during that trip to Texas he said Richard given him an unusual gold Cup forty five caliber semi automatic pistol to pay off a drug debt but by this time a year later he no longer had the gun.
Investigators stand located the second man rich visited on that trip who still had in his possession a box of ammunition Richard sold to hand.
Inside the box.
Investigators found several short black and white hairs.
Microscopic analysis confirmed that the hairs were from an animal but there were no roads attached so nuclear DNA testing was impossible.
But they were able to extract mitochondrial DNA from the hair.
Mitochondrial DNA is passed to animals and humans only from the modern.
Join how person a California veterinarian specializes in animal DNA.
It will not be as unique a profile as I might get from blood or saliva or hair with a route but it will still allow me to say yes this sample matches the reference dog or it doesn't match the reference stock breeds of dogs and to some extent caps today are really only a few hundred years old and so they don't differ that much that you could determinative we say for example well that's a donation.
Alverson performed a PCR test which stands for polymer raced chain reaction.
It'S basically like taking one page out of a book and you can ignoring the rest of the book and xeroxing that page a million times and now you have that page.
And so much quantity that you can see.
Then the sample was sequenced to get a visual representation of the DNA type.
When she compared the DNA from the hair in the ammunition box to a sample of quiches hair she found a haplo type in both sets that was extremely rare occurring only in one in three hundred dogs.
Chance of having that match just by random was pretty low.
combined with I'm sure the circumstances of the case if I were sitting on the jury I would find that to be a compelling piece of evidence in the case.
This was forensic proof that rich was in possession of an item stolen from John help.
Investigators got another break.
The man who was given the gold Cup pistole said he still had the gun by.
Inside was a note listing all of the custom alterations made to the pistol as well as the costs down when I asked me if I thought that was John's hand writing and I thought it was.
Investigators needed an expert.
For that they turned to Gary left a forensic document examiner.
He compared the note to known samples of apple's hand writing the question material was written with someone heavy pressure in the known writings.
That was also written with that same sort of pressure they were also all hand printed and is known writings also relied heavily on printing and not Kerr said.
He looked for unique features and individual letters in John's known writings features he then tried to locate in the questions document.
In the creation of other letters such as a lower case D..
I look to see if it's made with one stroke in other words the pen moves down on this damn back up slightly and counter clockwise motion forms the loop on the lower case D..
Based on his comparisons blik was able to draw a definitive conclusion.
I was able to identify the writer of the question material as John Hubbell.
That it was Havel's gone and no other that and they took with him to Texas.
Based on the hand writing analysis and the dog DNA and the rich was arrested and charged with John Havel's market.
There was nothing he was a user of people.
Which had an interesting response to the forensic evidence against.
The forensic evidence showed that anti rich was in John Hubbell's home around the time of this merger.
Based on the position of the body.
Securus believe rich killed couple after he fell asleep in the living room watching TV.
The motive was apparently money rich wanted to sell help pulls gun collection for either cash or drugs the shooting may have agitated will start.
To stop the barking rich put kisha in Havel's van then drove her several miles away before letting her out in a strange neighborhood.
Little did he realize that quiches hair would be found in the stolen box of ammunition and the canine DNA testing would prove it came from Handel's beloved dog.
How can you spare an animal and ensure human.
When rich sold Heppell surprised pistol in Texas he left a note inside with handwriting that match temples known handwriting samples.
The witness testimony and the forensic testimony pile together just added up like bricks in this case and it was because of the two and putting those two together that we were able to be able to solve this case in the first place.
On the day before his murder trial was to start.
And the rich made a surprise announcement.
He never turned around and never dressed family.
Never apologized for what he had done or or showed any remorse.
I was somewhat stunned by that I thought that that was the point in time where he would accept responsibility and do the right thing.
The parents and family of John help or sitting behind him it was his chance to try to make amends.
He failed miserably in doing that even today under which is own admittance.
John was one of his five best friends in this world.
Thank you so much peace a tri city killed one of his best friends.
Rich pleaded guilty to first degree robbery involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to thirty five years in prison.
In exchange for her cooperation Sharon Schneider was charged for drug possession and was sentenced to six months and a half way house and two and a half years probation.
Sharon was not a witness to the crime Sharon had pieces of the puzzle.
That she gave us.
I think it's very interesting how Keesha helped ultimately to be able to solve the crime of the homicide of her master I feel that cations solve the case along with the detectives and she provided the evidence against Andrew rich.
