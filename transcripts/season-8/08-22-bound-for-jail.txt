When investigators find her body clues at the scene point to a killer.
With professional training.
It took almost twenty years before an old hat and a chip of stainless steel no longer than a finger nail.
The killer to justice.
On a beautiful summer day in nineteen eighty six Muriel Kirby started her day as she always did by meeting her daughter Janette for breakfast well to me it was a very special routine just talking over what had been going on and what was on her mind on my money.
it it was very special.
Almost a friendship breakfast.
This morning was different from the others genet didn't show up and she never called or left a message.
she's over slept.
Because it's not like her not to make an appointment or to call and say I can't be there today.
Your next employer said she hadn't shown up for work and she wasn't at her home easier.
Her mother immediately notified police.
The thirty five year old divorce say with no children wasn't known for leaving town without notifying friends and family.
As night fell.
It was dark with rain clouds and during the night there were severe thunderstorms the worst in years.
The night that her family realized she was missing and started searching for her there was a torrential downpour.
I know in my heart that tenet was somewhere in that storm and she needed help Janette was an avid Walker and she often explored the secluded trails of nearby Riverbend park and undeveloped public space of more than five hundred acres.
Riverbend park is very large it's not what you would think of as a city park manicure and a small in size.
It'S gorgeous part the huge trees with the canopy absorb all sound.
You could touch off a cannon and there you wouldn't hear it.
The day after Jennette disappeared.
Police found her car at the park.
A parking ticket indicated the car had been there since the day before.
A daylong search of the park turned up nothing the search continued into the night I remember praying dear god better be all right.
It was wrong something was definitely wrong.
It was too close to his family she would never let us worry.
When dawn broke the next day police found gymnasts body in an isolated ravine just a half mile from her car.
There were clear signs of a struggle clothing was strewn about the area your next broken headphones from our tape player were found yards away from her body.
From the physical evidence at the scene the struggle took place on the walking trail itself however the body was dragged to a lower area by the drag marks left in the plant material in the dirt.
But investigators found something unusual at the scene.
And that's hands were bound behind her back with the plastic hi.
Consumers use ties like this for binding electric cables.
The police recognize these as the same type of ties they use called flex cuffs.
Police cops seen here on the left have a metal tab inserted into the plastic head.
Consumer ties seen on the right have plastic tabs that metal tail the axes like a ratcheting device and that's what makes flex cuffs different from normal household ties it's not something that you can readily go and buy a home depot or anywhere else.
Investigators now had a potential pool of suspects fellow police officers.
It was the young think of possible that one of their own had killed genet.
The rain that fell the night internet Kirby's murder made things difficult for investigators.
Rain is probably one of the worst enemy.
When you have a body found exposed to the elements because it will destroy a lot of the evidence.
Police could find no footprints to or from the scene.
There were no tire or bicycle impressions in the area.
At the autopsy the medical examiner found no signs of sexual assault the cause of death was three knife wounds in her chest.
In a search for suspects investigators routinely question relatives and friends.
Do not ex husband was in Florida at the time of the murder so he wasn't a suspect.
Investigators discovered that genetics dated casually but none of the men she dated had a motive to kill her.
It appeared her murder was a random killing the hardest type to solve.
We don't have an eyewitness we don't have the murder weapon we have no DNA evidence.
The way genex clothing had been cut gave investigators and there's this drive here this seeking of sexual stimulation and rather than just obtaining their through contact with the victim in this case it had to be obtained through a particular set of behaviors involving the victim's clothing.
A lot of time consuming process.
You start to get a picture of a person a very evil person.
Who is very.
Specifically with women and is most likely a predator of women.
Away from the path where he killed her.
The only thing the killer left at the crime scene where the flex cuffs they were the same brand used by the local police but the Tennessee based company that made the cops had some very bad news virtually every police force in the country used the same flex cuffs there were hundreds of thousands of them in existence all of them identical.
At the crime scene no one saw a policeman in or near Riverbend park around the time of the murder even policemen who were in the general vicinity of the park were questioned.
I know several police officers were investigated as a result of this homicide run down all the leads that they get but essentially they run up against a brick wall because nothing gets them any farther in the investigation they still have a pair of flex cuffs.
Full year past than to buy the fourth anniversary of genex murder local police had no new evidence or leads to press you.
They kept saying without.
We'Re not sure we're going to be able to solve.
It was four years after the murder that incident in Leland a tourist town two hundred miles away offered New Hope.
A woman there told police that a truck with police style lights signaled her to pull over on the deserted country road.
The man from the truck approached her wearing a police hat but no uniform he ordered her out of her car and into his truck she resisted there was a struggle he pulled his gun and fired a shot in the air.
When the investigators assigned to genex Kirby's murder this.
They took particular notice.
A man impersonating a police officer in an attempt to abduct a woman.
In a deserted area.
Sounded all too familiar.
Police questioned everyone they could find looking for the owner of an unmarked pickup truck with the police style light bar on the roof.
The gas station attendant remembered that vehicle called Avangard Gasser not only that but the gas station attendant remembered that the man had used a credit card to pay for the gas.
His name was David Drake hi.
He was a thirty three year old factory worker a volunteer fireman and an ex marine with no previous record he had been vacationing at his parents cabin and Glen haven but he lived in Ingham county in the same town as genet Kirby.
When questioned by police ray hi I'm denied he was involved in the attempted kidnapping although the victim identified him in a police lineup.
On the front seat of his truck.
He'S found a half from the Ingham county sheriff's department the same county where genet Kirby was murdered.
So they call the county sheriff's office and they say do you know this person is he one of your deputies is he someone that you're aware of is he connected to you in any way.
He is someone that we knew and regular basis trusted him knew him believed him to be a local guy.
Three time worked at a waste water treatment plant just a mile from where genet Kirby was killed inside Drake Heinz truck with two other suspicious items a knife and a package of plastic.
Similar to police style flex comes.
The suspect he has in his possession type of ties that could be characterized as flex cuffs although they're slightly different than the police flex cuffs but he has these plastic.
Fasteners in his possession.
Ray hi I'm denied any involvement in Jeanette's merger they didn't have the magical.
He didn't have the tie between him and the flex cuffs.
They knew that he was found in possession of something that looked like a river called flex cuffs up north of the you know where he got a.
There was no evidence tying him to genex merger but David ray Heim was convicted for the attempted kidnapping charge and sentenced to forty years in prison.
Once again your next case went cold.
Your next family had remained patient but in nineteen ninety eight twelve years after Jeanette's murder her mother could take no more.
She was disillusioned and angry that her husband died before they could get justice.
Janet was his baby analysts that was his girl and how could anyone talk to her or hurt her he was very angry and he kept that anger.
Until he died and his wishes so many times were if I could only get hold of him.
I know what I would do.
In desperation Mrs Kirby contacted the state's highest ranking law enforcement official.
When I finally went to Jennifer Graham home the Attorney General.
And asked her for help tools my story.
I said I'm going to send to criminal investigators on the case.
And those investigators found something that had been overlooked when David gray hime was arrested on the kidnapping charge the local police and three times home town failed to interview all of his friends.
For some reason a major character was overlooked and that was David drink cans best friend at the time of the murder he had never been interviewed.
That man was mark Grieco and he told police an interesting story.
A few years before genet Kirby's murder ray Hyman Grieco shared a house in both work together as security guards.
At the time we call on a use police car which Grieco pictured here with the car in nineteen eighty four was refurbishing is actually physically inside the trunk trying to run the waters up to the dash and.
That'S when I found the the plastic bag stuck in between the inner and outer fender well the car turned out to be a bag flex.
These were police issue flex cuffs that had been overlooked when the car was sold.
Rico said he kept one for himself and gave the rest to Drake.
I know I gave you some flex cuffs way back in eighty something when I bought this car and Grieco had yet another story.
He said he put his flex cuff in the brim of his security guard had it's a common practice in law enforcement.
Police naturally ask Rico whether he still had his security guard had.
The finished basement among dozens of boxes of clothing and souvenirs Griego found that very same hat he wore as a security guard fifteen years earlier.
The odds of that happening.
Are astronomical and the importance to the case cannot be overstated.
Inside the brain just as he said was a set of police flex cuffs.
It was the same make and model used in genetic Kirby's murder but investigators wanted to find some way to tell whether these two sets of.
We'Re scientifically related.
After years of searching for genetic Kirby's killer investigators finally had a break.
They discovered a police flex cuff similar to the one used in the murder.
To learn more about how these flex cuffs are made Michigan investigators went to Monterrey Mexico the only factory in the world that makes this brand of flex cuffs.
This is the video shot by those investigators since the cops were all made with the same plastic its chemical makeup provided no basis for comparison.
But the stainless steel tabs in the flex cuffs were another matter.
The cut marks at the end of each tab are distinctive.
A very fast process is just as continually cutting for hours at a time well during that process the blade starts to wear a little bit.
And while it's wearing the the marks that is leaving on the metal tabs are are are changing.
The flex cuffs used internet Kirby's murder and the flex cuffs provided by mark recall were analyzed by Scott merrier of the Michigan state police.
Using a soldering iron carefully remove the tab for each cop for comparison.
After all these years the case came down to some tiny slivers of stainless steel.
There was a time when I was looking at this metal tab thinking on this the entire case rests on the identification of these metal tabs.
Using a comparison microscope.
Merrier placed each tab on the party platform.
Then compared to two side by side.
He was looking for signature remarks made by the salt that cut the tax.
Merrier soon discovered that the marks were strikingly similar they ran down the length of each task almost like both sides of the zipper.
Quality of the identification so good that it would not surprise me at all if these two metal tabs had been produced consecutively it was an absolutely perfect match so perfect that it took everyone's breath away.
Now prosecutors and investigators had a piece of evidence that was a piece of scientific evidence that put David Drake Heinz at the scene of the crime.
On June twelfth two thousand two.
Prosecutors believe Freddie Hinds left his job at the water treatment facility around four thirty on the day of the murder and drove to Riverbend park less than a mile away.
Prosecutors say Drake Heinz was a predator and when he saw genet Kirby he was prepared he probably allowed her to jogger or fast walk past the point where he was hiding and attacked her from behind.
The media we grabbed her hands behind her back and flex cuffed her.
Now she was immobilized and isolated.
Do not Kirby was murdered and her clothes caught in the details genet Kirby was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time there's no weather link.
In those moments that she spent before she died had to have been terrifying.
At the trial of a surprise witness came forward saying the dray Hein had flex cuffed her years.
And it was dray Hines wife who provided the most unusual bit of testimony.
She told jurors he routinely jog with a small packet the flex cuffs in a bag he wore around his waist why on earth would he need that equipment with him when he went out on a daily job.
The only reason was either it was there because it was part of the daily fantasy that he carried with him in his head.
Or it was there because he was hoping to have some opportunity came up it would be there when he needed it.
David gray hime was found guilty of genet Kirby's murder and was sentenced to sixty years in prison in addition to the forty years he was already serving.
Verin six science solved the case which might have gone unsolved had it not been for the persistence of genetic Kirby smart.
And the man who never threw anything away.
The science doesn't age the tool marks that are left on those metal tabs will be there for help don't never change thankfully forensic science to.
And we could we can rest.
We can rest in peace knowing that her case has been solved because of forensic science.
