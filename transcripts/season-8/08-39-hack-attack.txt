A mysterious computer crash pushes a thriving manufacturing company to the brink of collapse jeopardizing the jobs of dozens of employees there is no apparent cause no obvious clues forensic investigators had to find out whether the disaster was caused by a computer defect human error or sabotage.
Today there are over seven hundred million computers at work in the world any one of those holds millions of records vital to people governments and industries.
But millions of pieces of information in one small box can make that information vulnerable.
Omega engineering manufacture high tech measurement devices for the United States Navy NASA and clients around the world.
A state of the art computer system at their New Jersey plant and able to make it to quickly customize their products to suit their customers needs the business was growing and revenues were up.
Then came July thirty first nineteen ninety six it was a bad data make on July thirty first of ninety six one of the workers get in about eight eight thirty in the morning went to his or her work station like they always did and they slipped on the system they booted up the computer and instead of coming on though it said fixing.
And the worker didn't know what was going on but fixing sounded pretty positive so he let it run and within seconds.
The information was down but it wasn't that one machine that was in trouble the manufacturing equipment at omega got its instructions from the computer server the brains of a sophisticated system that could store over one thousand different programs those one thousand programs build twenty five thousand different products and they could customize those products into five hundred thousand different pieces.
So you talk about everything that the company can make.
But now in the span of just a few seconds omega's vital computer system had crashed the plant's manager tried to get the server up and running again with no luck typically crucial files are periodically copied from the server onto a backup tape.
Make a thought they could restore the missing programs from their back up and the backup tape was kept in a filing cabinet in the human resources office but the tape wasn't there with no computer programs to drive the manufacturing process plant operators had only one option to complete the jobs that had already been started before the crash just to keep the machines running to keep producing to keep people working they just kept producing until they ran out of raw materials but they ultimately.
It is such a vast inventory of those specific items that they couldn't justify could continuing anymore so I had to shut the plant down one big problem that I make I had was that they had hired a new network administrator the former network administrator a long time employee named Tim Lloyd was now working for another company he was the one who actually built the network in the Americas health plans he was the genesis of their whole network he knew it inside and out he built it and he was friends with these people he was the designer for all the computer programming he was the overseer of of their network he maintained that he secured it nurtured it.
Manager Jim Ferguson called Lloyd to see if he could help solve the serious problem with the magus computer system to come across any you mentioned that you might want to look in the bait your look in the basement for some old tapes and back up and.
All may go was teetering on the brink of collapse with hundreds of jobs at stake and no clues about what it caused catastrophic shutdown of the computers.
Omega engineering faced a crisis so immense it could force the company out of business two weeks earlier the computer system that contained the plans for all their products inexplicably crashed.
Time was running out if I make a couldn't get its computer system back on layoffs would be inevitable.
What they lost was the ability to manufacture and when you're a manufacturing company you're dead in the water.
Make a hired Kroll ontrack a Minnesota based company that resurrects data from crashed computers all over the world any kind of media that actually store data on to anytime you lose access to this or for some reason becomes unreadable we get involved to help restore the data.
Bob Hackett a computer forensic experts began by examining the hard drive on a mega Sir it's the heart of a computer where information is magnetically encoded on a desk spinning at ten thousand revolutions per minute.
Physically the hardware which could be a hard drive or any of the components used to power or drive the hardware could fail but everything seems to be operational.
The drive was physically on damaged.
Reading the data would main examining the electronic contents contents that might reveal important evidence but make a management now wondered if the crash might have been sabotaged so to safeguard the hard drive they turned it over to the secret service experts in computer fraud the secret service new hunting for the lost programs might alter records on the drive.
Even just turning on the computer alters or override some of the information from a forensic standpoint you don't want to write to that hard drive the secret service made an exact digital replica of omega's hard drive a clone that enabled on track to examine all the data stored in the original what on track investigators discovered was startling all that remained was fragmented computer code mostly unintelligible even to computer experts.
This indicated the programs had not been simply delete it.
The leading a computer file the races only the name of the file the data actually remains in the computer's memory until it is replaced by something else so it's often possible to recover the information but in this case investigators discovered that make this programs had not only been deleted.
They had also been purged if we take the analogy of a piece of paper on the desk if I was to take that crumpled up and thrown in the wastebasket that would be called into a deletion a computer system I could still go grab that piece of paper out the garbage can unfold it and look at it a courage would take that same piece of paper run it through a shredder take we came out through the shredder thrown up in the air omega's data could never be recovered.
The focus now shifted to a forensic investigation into how and why the data was perched.
Greg Olsen an expert in the operating system used by omega examined the drive for signs of a virus.
Virus corrupts data by inserting it into whatever program is being run no viruses that would cause this particular damage.
User era was another possibility an accidental deletion.
Very common we find that a data losses happen because computer system system administrators come in and reinstall the operating system or made a mistake by reformatting the hard drive and I was able to rule that out effectively by looking at the system that clearly that that did not happen because the deletion was to surgical to be accidental.
Only the key manufacturing programs had been destroyed if it was intentional it could mean it was an inside job they would have to know where the specific programs are being kept it's not gonna be some kid home alone after school who chest randomly breaks into omega system and knows where those specific files are you need someone who's on the inside someone who knows where the keys to the castle are hidden and they know how to hurt the company.
The secret service first looked at Tim Lloyd the man who designed to make this computer system he had recently left omega for a job at another company supervisors had given him a positive reference the city was a good worker they said that he was excellent technically they didn't want to prevent him from getting another job.
Lloyd had left to make it three weeks before the computer crash so he didn't have access to the building to purge the manufacturing programs on the day of the crash they were kind of in a quandary as to who else besides him could have done it they thought maybe hacked in from the outside but they said that they disconnected any contact from an outside modem so they know that couldn't have been done.
Only supervisors had access to a make this computer system at the level necessary to cause this much damage.
But there was a problem.
Just about every body had supervisory rights and there were even some accounts are set up with a name like one two three four five it's really strange name with absolutely no password so there was no security on this.
Which meant that the perpetrator could have been anyone.
Six months after the massive computer crash omega was struggling to stay afloat Powell had its proprietary software been completely deleted.
Hold on tracks Greg Olsen an expert in the developer aiding system that controlled the server sifted the electronic flight some of the companies hard drive the problem is is we do delete the purge the entire road map to know where the status is completely gone so it's literally a lead needle in the haystack and impossible to pieces information together all your scene is a collection of letters and numbers that don't really mean anything Olson relied on sophisticated software to help him search for any suspicious commands what I'm looking for is bits of code that I know in the computer world constellation in this particular case when I when I was zeroing in on was any type of a delete or even any type of a purge.
We have a hit where I really hit gold was when I started taking hits on the search for purge eventually Olson found a purge command tied to five other lines of code seven six all six lines of these.
One two three four five.
It was a dangerously efficient bit of programming we called it a time bomb in the actual fuse with six lines of code and what it was is really a set of steps of the computer would go through some checks the first line simply check the date and compared it to July thirtieth nineteen ninety six the day before the server crash issues can be attached to anybody that's like yeah so when you come in with the fuse does a checks the date and if it's after the date on the fuse.
The second line of code access the server the third line was a logon command for the mysterious user one two three four five what kind of computer ghost the unsuspecting user and one two three four five we're logged in on the same machine.
But one two three four five provided the supervisory status needed to perform deletions.
The next line access to manufacturing programs the fifth line launched a program labeled six dot E. X. C..
When Olson looked at the code for this program it found a troubling.
The code had been generated from a commonly available deletion programs but it had been reconfigured to fool anyone using the system didn't modify the intentional deletion but the message that appears on the screen that would normally say deleting this file delete this file actually said fixing this file fixing this file the code was also re written to ignore safeguards automatically answering yes to the question are you sure you want to delete these files the last line of code was the courage command making the material on recovery.
It would happen relatively fast you could go get a Cup of coffee read the front page of the paper and come back and it's all done it's all gone.
And all the user had to do was turn on the computer but Olson and Hackett found other purge commands as well.
It has a test directory and.
Three sets of code dated for February April and may but the only deleted a useless task folder which would have gone undetected by the company what I deduce from that is essentially this was somebody was doing some testing of the application this particular time bomb to make sure that it would work before it was truly implemented and ready to go.
It appeared the tests were done while lawmakers former computer manager Tim Lloyd was still at the counter the secret service ran a background check and learned that Lloyd had been disciplined for run ins with co workers shortly before leaving the company there was conflict that for a gap between other employees between management between supervisors he would bottleneck projects just because he was in charge of the projects that he hadn't tested projects before they went into production and so there were a lot of problems one person even testified that he had elbowed a female co worker in the workplace.
On August twenty first secret service agents searched Lloyd's home and garage looking for evidence to tie him to the malicious code they found circuit boards computers more than five hundred desks several hard drives and data tapes what immediately stuck out was to take place built back up with the dates may fourteenth nineteen ninety six and July first nineteen ninety six authorities suspected it was the missing backup tape from omega but it was blank that dates that we found on some of the tapes had a format date of early August we learned that the backup tape had been reformatted or essentially erased a matter of days before the search warrant was executed.
The next thing we had to do was try to establish additional evidence that would support our theory that Lloyd was the guy so what we did was for example when it was time cards.
Lloyd'S time card show that he worked late on days in February April and may each time just prior to the test runs of the time bomb.
Then Hackett and Olson found a copy of the time bomb on one of Lloyd's hard drives.
So the same lines of code that on track had pieced together from the downed server they found those lines intact in Tim's home.
A relatively new statute made computer sabotage a federal offense if it affected the computer used in interstate commerce and cost more than five thousand dollars worth of damage.
Tim Lloyd was indicted by a grand jury his case would be the first test of the new law.
Prosecutors in New Jersey say the computer crash devastated omega engineering leading to ten million dollars of lost business two million dollars of reprogramming costs and eighty employee layoffs problem we've done less damage to the company if you've done it with a real bomb doesn't matter really what happens the billing if your data is gonna.
It is a white collar crime it's a very serious crime it's a non violent crime but you know what you don't know what the implications are people losing their jobs you know maybe maybe there was violence that occurred as a result of some of these folks losing their jobs maybe domestic violence.
Timothy Lloyd's four week trial began in April nineteen ninety eight it would be one of the first criminal cases to explore the arcane world of computer code how would an attorney who hadn't before this had a lot of technical expertise go into a really high tech field and explain it to a jury you're not going to show them fingerprints not gonna show them smoking gun or a bag a coke at trial prosecutors argued that Lloyd had fallen out of favor with the supervisors and grown resentful when he was reassigned.
Investigators had been able to prove that Lloyd developed the time bomb code at home then worked late so that he could install and test the code in secret he planned on quitting and was in the process of interviewing with another company when he was fired in fact he told a recruiter at his new company that everybody's job at omega is in jeopardy.
He made the remark on July thirty first the same day the computer crashed.
How would he know that.
On the day that that time bomb nobody even at home make them do that they said they thought they had a computer problem that's all they knew but everybody's job I think that that was a a remarkable find and something that the jurors were able to pick up on.
The most compelling evidence was the bits of code the computer experts found to have this maliciously damaged and delete and purge.
All the data from this point without really having any idea that this is actually happening and to do it in such a short quick fashion was very clever.
And he was gone being fired actually helped him any probably sat back there and said now they'll never connect me to this but we were able to find a a hard drive in his house that had that a command on had we not found that that he would have done away with once you find that in this house how do you explain that away.
The jury found Lloyd guilty.
Various appeals kept him free for almost four years but in two thousand two he began serving a prison term of three and a half years and ordered to pay two million dollars in restitution.
Lloyd claims he is innocent and that someone at omega accidentally deleted the programs he says he could have proved that a trial but his attorney advised him not to take the stand he's the consummate egotist I think he is absolutely livid that he was discovered I think that he was.
Fully intent on getting away with it in fact I think consistent with his personality he was actually prepared perhaps to ride to the rescue.
I think that there was a point in time when he was actually prepared to say I found it and and I'll ride to the rescue but I think when Ferguson says will bring in the secret service.
Or out of state to actually bring them the federal authorities at this point no I don't blame you on that they've taken of real genuine interest in coming in here but they may be in tomorrow I think that that changed his mind omega engineering never fully recovered but is still in business.
Kroll ontrack was given an award by the secret service but the unique role they played in a case that paved new legal ground it was interesting simply because it was one of the first cases of its type you know that we had seen them make it made a lot of technical mistakes but the biggest mistakes are caused by human factors where is because they trusted him is because they had real effects in for Tim and they thought that he was family and you let family get away with a lot more than you would anybody else you give a lot more rope to hang themselves with.
