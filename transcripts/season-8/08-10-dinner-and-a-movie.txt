An affluent young woman was found dead in her home while her husband was off on a sailing trip.
Police uncovered allegations of sex parties in wife swapping.
But it was an old movie and overheard telephone calls and the air conditioner.
And Alan Sherman lives in Niantic Connecticut for the entire sixteen years of their marriage.
And talk business at a local community college and was a member of mensa an organization for people with exceptionally high IQ.
Alan was five and a half months pregnant and worked in the family publishing business.
On a Friday night in August of nineteen eighty five left for a week long sailing trip with four friends.
They are always fun and we always have a great time.
Eight sailing from Maine down we stopped at the the vineyard Nantucket and what have you.
Boys night out there.
On Sunday afternoon two days into the trip and called his pregnant wife to make sure she was okay.
After numerous calls went unanswered had contacted land Fredericks and a good friend of the couple and asked him to check on an island.
I got over there when I was just starting to get dark and I could hear the air conditioner running in the house lights were on the inside and the outside I checked all the doors that lock locked up which was very strange because they always left the house open I used to kid down about you know come home some night will be nothing left in your house.
No one answered the door.
So Fredrickson entered the home through an unlocked window.
Inside was the family dog.
But there was no answer.
Stairs he opened the bedroom door.
And found Ellen's lifeless body on the bed.
I had no idea what happened I didn't think that should be murdered why would I think anybody would murder this wonderful person it appeared at first glance as if she were the subject of a sexual assault and night clothing was on the floor and her underwear and bedding.
Read literature marks around Allen's neck indicated strangulation.
The medical examiner determined that the merger occurred sometime Saturday night or early Sunday morning based on rigor mortis the temporary stiffening of the body after death the lines on your fingernails were evidence they had been bent backwards.
No signs of forced entry and no valuables were missing which ruled out robbery.
Using their ship to shore radio.
Policemen gave at Truman the bad news.
He talked to him for awhile which I wasn't listening to what he eventually did hand me the microphone and said Wayne take this it's the police they said Ellen's been killed detective Mike Mel check soon learned the fishermen's lives were far from ordinary.
It was a lifestyle of deception sex and intrigue.
The medical examiner estimated that Ellen Sherman was murdered sometime over the weekend while her husband was sailing in the Atlantic Ocean with friends.
And Sherman told investigators that he last spoke with his wife on Friday night from his friend's house.
They said that Mister Sherman did get on the phone telling his wife go to the bank to make this deposit all these different things.
And Sherman was unusually candid about their sex life.
In the girlfriend had a child and was his child.
The woman was adds co worker Nancy Prescott.
She was very different.
One of them open marriage he encouraged Ellen to have affairs.
And H. Sherman's lifestyle was unusual in other ways.
I remember being at a new year's eve party at their house I believe it was nineteen eighty four.
They had several couples there and I guess that we're gonna swap partners I was with a young lady in and asked me if I was interested in what I asked the young lady that was with it she was interested and I just.
And it was really the one that was.
Pushing that type situation Ellen did not want that life.
Totally unaware and would not have guessed.
Since there were no signs of forced entry police suspected Ellen may have known her killer.
No sign of a ransack all mining struggles for an intruder usually we see some no sign of struggle doctor Henry Lee at the time the director of Connecticut's crime lab was called in to assist investigators.
Doctor Lee examined photos of the ligature marks on Ellen Sherman snack and found a faint pattern.
Which so unique.
To com compare this to the clothing found at the scene including the torn panties.
The space starts opening up and shows I didn't.
But other evidence show that Ellen was strangled with bare hands not the panties.
The autopsy revealed the cricoid cartilage in the neck had been fractured something which cannot be accomplished during ligature strangulation.
Doctor Lee believes the killer wrapped the panties around her neck after which in order to stage the crime scene to make it look like a sex crime.
On the bed sheet under ultraviolet light was biological evidence investigators hoped would identify the killer.
Close to two hundred fifty to two hundred E. individu C. must.
That'S a lot of Siemens.
This biological evidence was too badly degraded for DNA testing which meant the material had been there for quite some time and had survived laundering while searching for suspects police discovered that adds some mistress Nancy Prescott may have been angry with AD and Allen added recently agreed to end the affair to save his marriage.
When I got pregnant she said I want you to stay home and be a father to this baby and be there when it's worn and give up the girlfriend.
So they they talked it out and it said that he was willing to give up his girlfriend and he would be a father and a husband Taylor.
Make a decision.
Why why why why why.
Detectives asked dad to take a polygraph test he agreed the results were inconclusive.
And Nancy Prescott had an alibi for the day of the murder.
Trail of the killer was starting to turn cold.
Mike Mel check had promised Ellen's mother rose that he would stay on the case and that the they would find out who did this to her daughter man now check got lucky.
Learned there was a movie that featured a murder identical to health insurance.
With this film lead police to the killer.
Initially police didn't consider ensuring a suspect in his wife's murder since he was on the sailboat in the Atlantic Ocean the day she died.
Some of the best become very important in many homicide investigation.
It'S a difficult.
Rigor mortis is one way to estimate the time of day.
This is what the body looks like when rigor mortis occurs.
Defending the entire body that last between twelve and twenty four hours after death.
When Ellen's body was discovered it was in the final stages of rigor mortis and becoming more pliable.
In looking through the investigator's report doctor Lee discovered an important clue it was something lan Frederickson said when he found Ellen's body was like a like open freezer almost.
The air conditioner was going full blast the person later described it as being extremely cold in the Rome colder than a normal person would have there a conditioner on freezing cold room the slow decomposition and the progress of rigor mortis.
This meant that Allan Sherman's murder could have occurred earlier than originally estimated.
Here is clear.
Although we don't know exactly hours.
If Allen was murdered on Friday night.
Then add Sherman would have had plenty of time to commit the crime.
Police also learned that Sherman was wearing long pants and a long sleeve shirt on the sailing trip in August looking back on it we were all in shorts and T. shirts and he had long pants on and a turtle neck.
I never saw him on the boat with short sleeves on.
Since Alan's fingernails had been damaged police suspected that it might have been hiding scratch marks.
The grisly denied this and insisted his wife was alive when he left he said he even spoke to her from his friend's home by telephone in front of witnesses.
Could have been the killer.
But it wasn't the only one listening into that conversation.
His friend's daughter was two she picked up and was getting ready to make a call I guess.
He said well I heard Mr Sherman talking on the phone.
When I was on the other and it was just ringing and ringing and I heard him say I love you too there's nobody there and I said why don't you hang up and she said well I thought it was very unusual because he was talking to a ringing phone is five minutes after he leaves his house he fakes a phone call his wife I mean it's hard to explain a little did you know that.
It you know some nine year old girl was gonna while bring him down he wasn't as smart as he thought it was.
And there was another interesting development.
A witness told police that she had run into it on the morning of this sailing trip during the conversation and recommended she watch a movie she.
In the film a man killed his wife and children the bodies inside the house then manipulates the crime scene forensic scientist and mass.
Ridgewood marketplaces tech comes out to the press and says the time of death is going to be very difficult to determine because the bodies were put in a cold room with the air conditioner turned away for the medical examiner estimates they were dead for at least three.
Slow the decomposition of five.
Was it possible that dad did the same thing.
Friends say he displayed a morbid fascination about details of his wife's murder.
Yes B. one C. S. B. ten times do you know if they determine the time of death he was very interested in in that.
He also asked me one time if I knew how a body decomposed that it was very strange question I said no.
Truth is absolutely stranger than fiction I mean the.
There are so many things that happen in real life that there's no need to make anything up I mean it's awful.
Police and prosecutors alike wondered what motivated and Sherman to kill his wife.
Despite the apparent reconciliation friends say and decided she wanted a divorce since Allen was the majority owner of the family business she allegedly told and that she would leave him with almost nothing.
And Alan said he could have his girlfriend and his and his sailboat and that's it.
So I said to I said you sure this is what you want to do she's I can't live like this anymore he says he's never going to be a husband and a father to our children he's always going to have this double life.
Prosecutors believe that ed Sherman carefully planned his wife's murder.
The couple had a late dinner and then while Ellen was changing her clothes in the bedroom prosecutors say had strangled her to death.
The forensic evidence shows that Alan was dead before it wrapped the panties around her neck to make the murderer.
To be a sex crime.
Inspired by the movie blackout he said the air conditioner to its coldest setting closed the door and left for the sailing trip around seven PM.
Later that night to cement his alibi he staged a call to his wife in front of his friends not knowing his friend's daughter listen listening in.
Sherman called land Fredrickson from the sailboat on Sunday evening asking him to check on his wife hoping the cold temperature of the bedrooms with the master the truth time of death just like the movie.
Of course with displaying important factor the first person discovered the body feel the temperature cold.
Young lady listen on the phone.
She almost got away.
He knew that I know.
He was the one that had murdered his wife and when he saw me he looked at me and I just walked in I was the first one in and he looked over and I said and it's time and.
He turned white he started to sweat and he knew it was time.
And the forensic evidence mattered most to jurors during deliberations they asked to hear again the testimony of doctor Lee and the medical examiner.
Generally on the.
One of the jurors said that it boiled down to the to the fact that they figured he at the time in the in the in the opportunity and the motive.
Six years after his wife's death.
First degree murder and he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison.
Y. LA Truman never admitted guilt he did show some remorse.
He said she deserved a better lifestyle and he apologized for leading such an indulgent lifestyle.
And then he said I do not know who killed.
After spending only three years in prison at Sherman died of a heart attack at the age of fifty two.
It was a very bright individual high I. Q..
And like to make people know that he was smart that's the way he made made me feel I've heard the same from other people it's thought he could have whatever I wanted.
He'S got to be an awful cold person to be able to do that that's a hands on prime.
So he's a cold calculating person.
Doesn'T deserve any sympathy from anybody.
Sherman was not smarter than the detectives and scientists who investigated the case.
In all my years of doing this I've never seen a case where a body was placed in an air conditioned room it was turned up to the maximum degree.
Two apparently throw off the time of death this case demonstrates how important she.
