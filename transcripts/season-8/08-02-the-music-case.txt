Twelve year old girl is murdered in our own home and the case stalls when investigators find little forensic evidence at the crime scene.
But scientists also know that criminals unknowingly take evidence with them as they leave a crime scene.
And in this case the killer left with the genetic fingerprint of his victims.
In between two of Minnesota's ten thousand lakes is a small town of Waseca.
Community with virtually no violent crime.
Not far from the shores of loon lake.
Is the home of Connie Larson and her three daughters they're all like five in four years apart but they are very close they were never apart and they just adored each other Callie was definitely the baby of the family.
And she's Daddy's little girl.
Twelve year old Kelly Joe was in the seventh grade and loved gymnastics.
She was good I think because she just loved it and she put a lot of energy into it it was a wonderful place for her to be and with her energy and spirit she just she just really did well in gymnastics.
After school on April twentieth nineteen ninety nine Kelly Joe o'connell for school bus and walk this path towards home just as she always did.
Kalli Jo was the first one home that day her mother and sister were expected later.
The rule in the family was everyone needed to be home and no visitors at five o'clock because that's when I arrived home and then we had our family time.
Sixteen year old Jamie was the next family member to arrive home when she opened the door she saw evidence of a burglary in something far worse.
Jamie immediately called her mother at work and then police I realized that there was something wrong and she wasn't telling me.
Coming around the corner and looking up the stairs was a difficult side for everybody I mean there were thirty year investigators were having a difficult time with that.
But it's just looking at who would do something like this up stairs Kalli Jo was dead the fatal stab wounds was in the left chest area severed deer cut the ascending a order and she bled to death internally still hard for me to.
I think that she's gonna mean that means that that that just it just can't be.
I'Ve got two kids of my own if somebody if this occurred to one of my children I don't know what I would do and I can't even imagine.
Kalli Jo school books were near the front door.
An indication she may have surprised the intruder.
The point of entry was the basement door.
Some cash silver certificates and the girl CD collection of music were missing.
Forensic scientists found blood on the stairs which was collected for analysis.
Despite the latter investigators also look for fingerprints you can attend to focus on the areas where you're pretty sure that the perpetrator was and then you focus on areas where drawers were tossed and stuff has been you know taken out moved around there weren't too many services left in that house that did not have some kind of fingerprint powder residue.
Investigators vacuums the carpeted floors for possible trace evidence.
They were convinced that the killer had left behind enough forensic evidence to catch him we have a lot of fingerprints there were hundreds of here's Intel's vacuums I actually thought that we were in good shape a forensic cases like a puzzle in you were trying to find different pieces of the puzzle that fit to give you the pictures to what happened.
Kalli Jo Larson's death except a sad precedent for was seek a Minnesota the small town had never had a homicide in its history it destroys the safety factor of everybody in this town everybody well I think a lot more people started locking their doors.
All which sounds a little flippant but that's the reaction.
Branch six scientists thought the blood on the steps near Calais Joe's body may have been the killers but forensic tests revealed it was Kelly Jo's.
Next investigators hope the killer left his fingerprints in the home but this was another dead end when all the dust had settled so to speak all of the latent prints that we had taken out of the house were identified to family members and friends there were no unknowns left.
One of the fingerprints found on the bathroom sink was initially difficult to identify.
Over time Peterson would come too easily recognize Callie Joe's unique pattern.
She had a look better but it had another loop that was over the first loop.
And kind of came to a point on the other end that's unique you don't see that very often.
The only other physical evidence from the crime scene two foreign hairs one found on Kelly Jo's body the other on the carpet.
But until you know whose hairs to compare them to you've got nothing.
And the hairs didn't have any real materials so they couldn't be sent for nuclear DNA testing.
A neighbor reported seeing an unfamiliar man near the Larsen home around the time of the merger.
This is the composite sketch of the man.
Another neighbor saw a black pickup truck in the area.
Police searched their records for individuals matching this general description who also had a past history of burglary and sex offenses.
They found twelve potential suspects we call the dirty dozen and because we had twelve suspects that we could not exclude from the investigation either you know by alibi here for whatever reason.
One of the so called dirty dozen was a convicted sex offender Donald block.
The significant fact about Blom was that he was also a suspect in the kidnapping and murder of nineteen year old Katie player the convenience store cashier in moose lake Minnesota just a few hours drive away.
These are security camera pictures of that abduction unfortunately they weren't clear enough to identify the up doctor.
Police learned the blonde made several trips to Waseca around the time of Callie Joe's merger.
He also drove a black pickup truck like the one seen near Larson's home and I was being bombarded with so many truths that I didn't want to know.
So as I heard more about down the block I I suppose the more fascinated we became with the possibility that it could be denied any involvement in Calais Joe's death and said he had an alibi for the day of the murder.
As winter approached in Waseca.
November December was a very bleak time everybody was very depressed.
Despite more than thirty thousand pages of reports and boxes of physical evidence investigators weren't any closer to solving the crime and the day it occurred.
We had absolutely nothing and I was really becoming concerned whether this case was ever going to be solved.
And soon police in Waseca were faced with another crime problem.
There were a rash of home burglaries in Waseca not far from the Larsen home.
And the perpetrator left behind some evidence a shoe impression from an athletic shoe which had a distinctive zigzag pattern.
A lot of the burglaries have been happening on my chest and it was becoming very personal.
On a routine patrol near the burglaries officer Marcus and spotted a man walking along the sidewalk.
So Marcus and stopped the man to ask a few questions.
When he did he noticed something familiar Marcussen was able looked down and saw the shoeprint in the snow and that looked like the shoe print that they've been seeing from some of those burglaries.
And while patting him down found a large screwdriver and a flashlight in his pocket.
Those are the tools there's no good reason for this kind of a walk in this neighborhood in a clock at night without a flashlight is pocket.
The man was identified as Lorenzo Sanchez an illegal immigrant from Mexico.
In his home police found stolen property from several burglaries and police couldn't help but wonder whether Lorenzo Sanchez was also.
Not surprisingly with the arrest of Lorenzo Sanchez the was sick of burglaries stopped.
In Sanchez's home police found items stolen from the burglaries they also found many compact discs but not the ones stolen from Callie Jo Larson's home.
In the bottom of Sanchez's closet.
Police found two CD cases on a hunch they were photographed and shown to Connie Larson.
Officer came over with a picture of the CD cases and said the Saudis and I just want you to look at I mean just tell me if you recognize them and I took the picture and I said yes those are those are countless.
Sanchez denied the cases were stolen and said they were his his welcome present in the.
I bottles in the store.
It had been almost a year since Kelly Jo's murder and investigators hope there may be some forensic evidence on the CD cases.
The first problem was that the outside cover was vinyl.
Just getting the latent fingerprints off off them is is slim to none to begin with.
If you do get one getting one that's a good usable identifiable latent fingerprint is even slimmer.
Never the less the cases were sent to Dave Peterson for analysis and I got to the second at the last page of the second CD case I opened it up and it was a blond here lane in between the sleeves.
No I got a little excited about that.
in fact my heart started racing just to hear.
On pardon the pun.
That hair was sent for DNA testing.
Next Peterson wanted to see if there were any fingerprints on the plastic sleeves which hold the individual CD's.
For that he used a technique called super glue fuming.
I suspended these two CD cases from a ride and then fanned out these plastic sleeve there were on the inside.
And what happens is the super glue fumes as they are omitted from the heat will adhere to the moisture left behind Italy's print.
In turn the ridge detail white.
Peterson found only one print on the very last sleeve the second CD case.
The printer had a distinctive overlapping little.
One Peterson immediately recognized the analysis confirmed that it was Callie Joe's right ring finger print.
And at that point I called Bob Bergen said I think I got something for you.
I said you gotta be shitting me I am new to this are at that point I knew it was him we weren't finding the suspect's fingerprints something to put him at the scene we kind of did this in reverse we found him in possession.
With something that.
Came from the C..
The blond hair found in the CD case was further confirmation D. N. A. tests showed it belonged to Callie Jo.
Despite the evidence Sanchez denied he was involved in the murder all the evidence proved was that Sanchez was in possession of a piece of stolen property.
Police had one last piece of evidence to foreign hairs recovered from the Larson crime scene.
Those hairs along with a hair sample from Lorenzo Sanchez was sent to the forensic lab for the newest DNA test available.
Mitochondrial DNA is a specialized unit test if you cannot obtain results using nuclear DNA analysis the fall back on mitochondrial DNA testing.
Mitochondrial live outside the cell nucleus.
For the test each here sample is placed into a vile where it changes form into a liquid.
The impurities are extracted leaving only purified DNA.
Next millions of copies are made of just the mitochondria portion and then sequenced.
When completed doctor Holland could read the genetic code of the hairs from the crime scene and so this particular piece of the puzzle suggested that those players were in fact from Mister Sanchez.
The question was which Mr Sanchez mitochondrial DNA is passed from a mother to her children all of whom will therefore have the same mitochondrial DNA profile.
In other words the suspect the Renzo Sanchez would have the same mitochondrial DNA as is six brothers and sisters.
To complicate matters Lorenzo's younger brother Mikhail also had a police record and was in wash he cut at the time of the murder.
The investigation into Kelly Jo's murder wasn't over yet.
You know centers and I am innocent of that because I did not kill her it is an injustice what they're doing with.
The rain so Sanchez continued to maintain his innocence in the murder of Callie Jo Larsen even though a CD case with Callie Joe's fingerprint was discovered in Sanchez's home.
And two hairs found at the crime scene at the same mitochondrial DNA profile as Lorenzo Sanchez.
Mitochondrial DNA is not positive identification as nuclear DNA is.
Since mitochondrial DNA is passed from a mother to her children all of the Sanchez siblings would have the same mitochondrial DNA profile.
Two of Lorenzo Sanchez brothers had spent time in Waseca a younger brother Miguel and an older half brother Pedro.
Pedro said he had an alibi that he was in Mexico on the day of Kelly Jo's murder which checked out.
Miguel Sanchez was in was sick of that day but this time she chose that he was at work at the time of Kelly Jo's murder.
Lorenzo was the only Sanchez brother with no alibi his work record showed that he was not at work when the murder occurred.
With that the Renzo Sanchez was charged with first degree murder he maintains his innocence until his sister in law visited him in prison and the two had a conversation that was taped by prison officials.
Can it specifically says in that conversation you know the only thing that they have.
To link me.
Is the hair you understand the hair is the only thing they've got the company independently and Sanchez asks his sister in law to place the blame for Kelly Jo's murder on his half brother Pedro.
There were some apparently some sibling rivalry their end is brother Pedro had a record and which included some violent offenses.
When Lorenzo Sanchez was confronted with the tape of this conversation he had a few choices.
He eventually pled guilty to first degree murder and was convicted.
When Kelly Jo walked into our home and saw Sanchez in the middle of a burglary Sanchez silenced a person he thought was the only witness.
But there was another witness that day forensic evidence.
The microscopic here Sanchez left behind and Callie Joe's here and fingerprint on the CD case told the story.
At his sentencing.
On the Larson finally had her chance to speak directly to our daughter's killer.
When his confession and then in his statement after asked us to forgive him.
In this place.
It'S hard to know what you would do.
That being in this place.
it hasn't been hard for me.
Honestly on that day I put it down.
Two years after the crime.
And so Sanchez was sentenced to life in prison.
Know where to start today Connie Larson works as a social worker with families who've lived through traumatic events she's also become an advocate for better databases to track criminals like Lorenzo Sanchez who often slip through the cracks.
Kelly Jo is never far from her thoughts.
We talk about her constantly we'll tell stories about.
Read her notes.
she is just a part of what we're doing now today.
Without the forensics we have nothing this case was to live or die by the forensic evidence.
Well it was absolutely critical we would have not had a case without that forensic evidence Lorenzo Sanchez would never been convicted of the murder of killers.
