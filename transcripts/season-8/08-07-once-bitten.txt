An unusual by mark on a murdered woman resulted in his conviction and death sentence.
A forensic expert told the jury that he was one hundred percent certain that it was chrome the victim he knew it was wrong but he'd already committed in his comment to me was I mean to the.
The CBS lounge is one of many neighborhood bars in downtown Phoenix Arizona.
M. and Kona managed it for him.
In the bar business you have to have a nice personality you have to be honest.
And now all those qualities can hand.
On December twenty ninth nineteen ninety one GM closed the bar at the usual time shortly after one AM.
As was his custom tank cold to make sure there hasn't been any problems can mansard I asked us if everything okay do you have any problems and she said no she's active I know you're tired gorgeously breast.
When I arrived the next day to open up he noticed the door was ajar.
I know my bartender did leave the door open I know I didn't so something's wrong the first check the safe but none of the bars money was missing.
He went to the kitchen.
No one was there.
And still see that that C..
I sorely and a bathroom.
Her eyes fixed.
I still remember that to this day well the rest of my life but that the girl was beautiful even in death.
The evidence suggests the killer grabbed a knife from the kitchen forced him into the men's room.
On his way out he left a shoe print on the freshly cleaned kitchen floor.
For rent to get spurts identified the printer as a converse brand sneakers size nine and a half.
Here'S four found on Kim and Kanye's body they were black and not hers.
That'S the killer had been through Kim's tank top leaving a bite impression on her skin.
Two drinks were sitting on the bar apparently port after closing time forensic scientists found Kim's fingerprints on one class the other had prints not clear enough for identification.
Working theory then became she must've known who the person was allowed them into the bar against company policy but none the less and thereafter was killed by that person robbery didn't appear to be the motive there was no money missing from Kim's purse inside her purse police found an address book with the name and telephone number of one of the bars regular customers.
It was not not well alight you know he was just a party or something there was something different about it that people that didn't sit well with people some of the bars employees told police that Kim had expressed a romantic interest in chrome if the bite mark show impression and the hairs could be tied to him.
During Kim and Kanye's autopsy forensic photographers took numerous photographs of the bite wound on her upper chest.
The photograph showed the killer had a distinctive bite.
James address books contain the name and telephone number of a man named ray crown someone she had often spoken with at the bar.
Kim and Kona had told several friends that she was interested in reading that she liked him you know that she thought maybe something could happen and those friends in turn relayed that to detective.
Ray crone was thirty five years old an Air Force veteran with no prior criminal record.
Several bar employees told police that Kim had a date with chrome planned for the night of her murder.
When police talked to Kim's friends the last person that they expected came and going to meet that night was way crown to he was supposed to meet her to help close the barn when questioned rate crone said the two were just acquaintances he denied there was any romantic relationship.
She was always nice congenial person very friendly and outgoing and so it you know it.
Like to personality like dean over her bubbly nis and things like that there wasn't a relationship and chrome denied that he had plans to meet Kim at the bar as our friends claimed he also had an alibi he shared a house with a co worker who said chrome was home the night of the murder.
But as police questioned crown they noticed that his left front to protruded slightly in a way that looks similar to the bite wound found on Kim's chest after looking at the bite marks on chemical this body detectives pretty readily jump to the conclusion that his teeth matched can count the bite marks found on her body.
Croon willingly agreed to provide an impression of his teeth by biting into a piece of styrofoam which is commonly used since its soft but still stable.
Forensic odontology just examined a series of bite impressions from men who knew him and call nine.
They found only one in which the left front tooth was clearly expanded just like the bite mark on the body.
It was ray crowns I hear you know brakes squealing door slamming I'll look over here's a police van or loading with officers all armed guns point at me tell me to freeze I was thrown to ground hand cuffed and taken off and I was charged with murder kidnapping sexual assault that was the day my rest new year's eve of nineteen ninety one.
Prone maintained he was innocent but he had no explanation for why his bite impression looked like the wound on Kim and cone.
A very frustrating aggravating belittling.
Situation were you just saying why what what why why will somebody less mobile so we take a minute and look at this intelligently responsibly you're gonna see that there is a definite problem.
The bite wound wasn't the only evidence against chrome.
The perpetrator leftist saliva on Kim's clothing DNA tests of that saliva sample were inconclusive but test revealed the perpetrator had type O. blood the same blood type there's Raycroft.
He was arrested and charged with murder.
At his trial prosecutors believe the bite impression evidence was the most convincing the hired a nationally known bite mark expert from Las Vegas Nevada to testify that it was a one hundred percent perfect match better than a fingerprint expert was doctor Raymond Ross and a forensic odontology just and also a senator in the Nevada state legislature.
The trial Dr Rawson you this video in which photographs of the bite wound from Kim and Kanye's body were superimposed on ray Crohn's bite impressions.
Based on that evidence ray crown was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to death.
I don't care if I was going to be in prison for somebody to do it you might as well kill me what was life my whole life everything I work for everything I stood for thirty five year old man was gone.
That judge believes the bite marks were form of torture and because of that the sense into debt.
Could a nationally known forensic odontology just be wrong.
Ray Cronin had spent three years on death row for the murder of thirty five year old bar manager came and called.
During that time he formed his own opinions about the bite impression evidence used to convict him I mean you basically could take a sharp object stick it in the skin a couple places and have somebody say oh yeah that's a bite mark and I know it matches him and you can get if you show to know people do you have you know somebody say that yeah it's a match.
All death penalty cases in Arizona are automatically appealed to the state Supreme Court and fortunately for chrome this bite mark videotape made by the prosecution provided grounds for an appeal the court ruled that the defense team wasn't given enough time to review the tape before the trial.
Three trials his family asked Chris lord to represent him lord specializes in difficult forensic cases.
I heard the story you know that red cross on death row as a result of a bite mark up I didn't know whether other evidence supported this conviction or not that was originally kind of skeptical because I hear the stories all the time forensic experts hired by Florida discovered that the hairs found on Kim's body were mongoloid hairs meaning they were from someone of Asian or native American descent.
They also discovered that rate chrome wore size ten and a half shoes a shoe impression found on the kitchen floor of the bar was a size nine and a half the defense brought in Dr skips Berber a past president of the American academy of forensic odontology just to look at the bite wound evidence that more than anything else convicted crown in his first trial.
What Dr Sperber told them came as a shock.
He said he'd seen this evidence before.
It had been sent to him before the first trial a good friend of mine John P. acticin Phoenix Arizona called me and he asked me to look at this particular case the people versus crone when I first viewed that Kay's thought there were too many inconsistencies for that to be a positive comparison between the teeth of ray crown the suspect and the victims warns Dr Sperber told his colleagues working for the Arizona prosecutors that this evidence was exceptionally weak we say on a range of one to ten.
With ten being very good I would have rated this around three or four on the low side here is a bite mark considered on the high end of the scale of nine or ten all the teams have made clear marks and the relationships between the teeth can easily be seen.
The bite wound on Kim and Kanye had very few distinct markings.
Dr Sperber the cast of ray Crohn's disease and using a low tech time tested method made a styrofoam impression and then traced the teeth patterns onto a transparency.
He then placed a transparency over the top of the photo of the bite mark on Kim and Kanye's.
Ray chrome does not have any separation between his front teeth.
The bite marks on the victim's body shows an obvious separation between those cities.
For Dr Sperber the results were clear if it say goodbye it will really jump out at you and you will see immediately similarities in the crown cays there were no similarities to this was the key events and and to get the initial report back to the right of a bite mark experts said it's not me was like allow the something something good could happen in the second trial Dr Raymond Ross the same bite mark expert from the first trial repeated his testimony he said there was no doubt the bite mark was from ray Kroc.
Team of defense experts disagreed I can positively exclude ray crone is being the bite I wasn't the only one there were three other friends again etcetera all board certified highly qualified guys and they excluded but the jury disagreed.
They sided with the prosecution's expert and founder ray croc.
What does it take what is this beyond reasonable doubt what is this innocent till proven guilty it don't exist in the and and and it just system the one that I seen it did not exist for me we knew that there was another person in that bathroom at the time of death unknown fingerprints that came back to somebody there was a person who had shoes that were inconsistent with the defendant the hairs were inconsistent with the defendant the FBI forensic people testified that the shares were not Mr Crohn's that were not the victims to me logical common sense told me it was a mistake from the committed this crime and the jury found the opposite result what I heard the verdict in the second trial like I really couldn't believe his total disbelief it was an absolute dog and pony show the likes of which I've never seen before break crown tried to reconcile himself to a life behind bars.
But then he got help from an unlikely source the very system he had grown to despise.
Ray crown languished in prison for a crime that some of the country's top forensic experts said he didn't commit.
Just before chrome second trial.
Dr Richard super on one of his defense experts sat next to the prosecution's forensic expert Dr Ross and at a scientific conference.
His comment to me was I meant to date he knew he was wrong but he'd already committed and if that isn't a scary sight I don't know what is and I hated to see him get sucked in on something like this and told him you know.
Get out of this deal just I don't want to do it anymore or I've changed my opinion or theirs I've listened everybody else and you know I've rethought my position anybody can make a mistake that we were not none of us are about making mistakes but he said I mean to date.
And that was the end of that conversation.
Through a spokesperson Dr Ross and denies that the conversation described by doctor super on ever took place.
It wasn't until two thousand one that a new law offered Crohn's simple.
Arizona one of the first states in the United states passed a new bill for post conviction DNA testing which allows convicted offenders access to evidence and post conviction DNA testing if they contend that they were innocent so crowns defense team asked the state of Arizona to test every piece of human colonists clothing for DNA the saliva on Kim's blouse had already been tested and the results were inconclusive.
Altered genes have small blood stains.
The jeans were sent to the state crime lab for a new DNA test that analyzes thirteen different genetic markers the test yielded unanticipated results the blood on the G. wasn't and conus and it wasn't great.
To find out.
Rancic scientist entered this new DNA evidence into a national DNA database with genetic profiles of more than a million convicts from across the country.
Profile after profile was checked and cross referenced and the database came up with a match.
To this man.
A thirty five year old native American Kenneth Phillips who is currently in prison for child molestation.
At the time of Kim and Kanye's murder Kenneth Phillips lived just six hundred yards away from the C. B. S. line.
He lived right behind the bar.
And his nationality was an American Indian which which was consistent with some of the other DNA results we had in the here's was found to sing the crime when interviewed by police Phillips made a startling admission he said on the morning after Kim's murder he woke from an alcoholic blackout to find his hands covered with blood.
Then he saw on the news of the murder on.
His fingerprints were among the unknown fingerprints found in the bathroom where the murder took place.
And despite impression at the same level two protruding from the rest of his teeth.
After serving ten years and four months for a crime he didn't commit.
He walked out of prison a free man.
It'S been over ten years in prison.
So I won't ever forget.
Rancic odontology say that the problem with the trump case was a doctor Rosen told jurors marks could match like fingerprints but that is rarely possible.
The best that a forensic dentist can give is reasonable certainty and that means that that's the highest level we give there is always a remote possibility that there's someone else that has T. sim or they could have left the pattern.
Nine to resume his life.
Experts say the lesson of his case is the bite marks are rarely definitive and should only be used to exclude not include suspects.
Market analysis is more opinion than fact.
There should always be made clear to jurors.
Gross case was bad science scientific explanations given by people who were unscientific in their methods transportation a bite mark is what convinced me that this item not the fingerprint Sittin batch mate that's the big had footprints in the Knesset she used to here not the not the the DNA none of that stuff they use interpretation a bite mark to convict me that has no place in the court room anymore than perjury has a place in the courtroom we shouldn't allow witnesses that why no matter what they say whether it's regarding a scientific issue or any other issue in this case it was clear that some of the scientific experts were actually misrepresenting their data and scientific validity of what they were talking.
