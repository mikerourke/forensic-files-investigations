The man was dead in the Michigan junkyard.
And there were no clues or forensic evidence at the scene.
But computer forensic experts found evidence of a crime that had everything sex lies and videotape.
On November eighth nineteen ninety nine Chuck Miller got a frantic call from his sister in law his brother Bruce was missing.
Bruce hadn't come home for dinner and he wasn't answering his telephone network.
Chuck drove out to his brother's junk yard to look for.
Bruce Miller was dead of a gunshot wound to his chest.
Telephone receiver was near his head Bruce normally kept around two thousand dollars in his front shirt pocket to make change for its customers that money was missing.
The motive appeared to be very.
Two thousand dollars cash in the pocket would look good a lot of people in the area we just thought it was a just a random someone just walked in and shot him because he always get monies from pocket.
Took that money and just to be another robbery another day in flint.
Criminalists from the Michigan crime lab used one sided tape to collect possible evidence from Bruce the shark.
That type of thing I took from this particular victim only had his his own head here on it there was nothing for and that was determined on the table.
And there were other signs that this crime scene was a little too clean.
We'Re talking about a business that had been cleaned and probably since it opened regarding grease or oil everything that leaves a good light right a good question.
So he knew what to touch one not to touch and might have even taken other protective measures in order for him not to be found it was also troubling that Bruce was on the phone when killed.
To whom was he speaking.
No one calls it I was on the phone with Bruce Miller and I heard a gunshot there's no latent prints that were no bloody prints.
They'Re taking the money out.
Bruce Miller was forty eight years old six months earlier he married twenty eight year old Siri and he was about to adopt her three children.
By all accounts seem to be a very hard working kind of mellow guy.
You know took a chance with Merion sherry Miller and her kids and taking on that load as well as having two jobs working at General Motors as well as running a child care.
According to friends and family it was a happy marriage.
She would talk to the.
Bruce Miller how is the best thing that ever happened to work how he was a good lover how her kids in Indira this was an older gentleman.
That caught the young woman and he treated her like a princess Shuri had been at home all day with their children and several friends and wasn't considered a suspect.
But she had a pretty good idea of who might be responsible.
She told detectives that one of her former boyfriend's John Hutchinson told her husband several thousand dollars.
Use it had run ins with John in the past arguing over him stealing auto parts from the business late at night and they are you just recently over a sale of a twenty dollar tire to John Hutchinson step son Arjun Singh claimed he was at home alone at the time of the murder it was an alibi that couldn't be corroborated.
It would take a second death.
The four detectives would get to the truth.
John Hutchinson emerged as a key suspect in junkyard owner Bruce Miller's murder.
Options and agreed to take a lie detector test.
He collapsed during the examination.
John Hutchinson had some kind of episode where he ended up going to the hospital but apparently he was pretty stressed out by this polygraph which he did not pass.
But police needed more evidence than a polygraph.
The autopsy revealed Bruce had been killed twenty gauge shotgun.
In a search of Hutchinson's home police didn't find a twenty gauge shotgun bloody clothing or the missing money the feeling was here probably don't.
We'Ve exhausted all of our leases are best prime suspect what are we doing what can we do differently to make it work so we can get the truth.
Weeks went by then months there is been no new leads in the case.
But something unusual happened seven hundred miles away in Kansas city Missouri.
The former homicide investigator named Jerry Cassaday was found dead in his home.
His gun still in his hand there was a Bible in his lap divorce papers were on his desk and a report showing he had recently been treated for depression.
In a trash can outside the home.
It appeared to be a home video of a woman dancing seductively.
Definitely seductive tool something you would send a guy.
that you're trying to seduce.
Raines told police they thought the woman on the tape was Jerry's girlfriend who lived in flint Michigan and that her name was sherry.
When investigators called police in flint.
They knew just who they were talking about.
It was like getting hit upside the head of the sudden shocks like and I can't believe it she duped me.
Sherri Miller was brought into police headquarters for questioning.
She claimed that she did not even know J. Cassidy.
This is an audio recording of the actual interrogation.
I did that.
When we showed her that we had this videotape of her for Gerry Cassidy written right on the tape for Jerry's eyes only she went from not knowing Jerry Cassidy deterrent I know all these crazy.
I mean the time just to figure out something new to do I mean everybody does that.
Computer forensic experts confiscated cherries computer as well as Gerry Cassidy and what they discovered inside.
Answered some important questions but raised in many others.
This is one of most bizarre cases are handled in the ten years I've been dealing with the subject matter there was deception there was a love triangle whenever there's an internet connective itty issue that relates to a murder case of course is going to be six.
Things were starting to get interesting.
Police century Miller's computer and the one used by her suspected lover Jerry cast today to an expert in the new field of computer forensics.
I get the stuff that's been deleted I get the space that are used by the computer I get everything and that's what I examine has a computer forensics specialist.
Charges dropped was able to mirror the hard drive which means he kept the hard drive in its original format but makes a mirror image of it we as investigators can use to download.
The information on there with out ever tampering with the original best evidence.
Branch a computer specialist can also gain access to password protected accounts on the hard drive.
Passwords locked documents away from anyone except the owner.
Investigators easily made their way into Jerry's injuries private files I believe we have like three four hundred bookmarks fragments that I'd found that were relevant.
There were probably thousands of hits on her name on the justice retired thirteen.
Investigators found incriminating evidence on Jerry's computer and in his private.
It was an instant message conversations in which Jerry injury discussed merger.
I'Ll call Chris at five PM and tell him to call when he's leaving Jerry I'm scared is the gun loud it's deer hunting season here inside with the best possible to pull up to the left of the building right to the door he'll stay at the desk inside take his wallet take the whole thing.
There was discussion about pull the car up I believe it was to the right side of the door of the office to the auto parts place because then when you open up the driver's side door of the car it would help hide a gun in your hand as she stepped out and went towards the front door of the business.
Police confronted Chery with this computer message.
In front of me about how you injury casting planned his murder.
Okay why would you even think about changes I.
It doesn't make sense does.
The jury said the instant messages were forged officials at A. O. L. confirmed that this was a possibility.
We first informed the prosecutors and investigators at this is an instant message that may not be authentic.
Possibly could have been edited but I couldn't say in fact it was authentic and did come through the America online service and its exact for.
It was very important for us to forensically backup this instant message and show that there was a relationship and and show how she got Gerry Cassidy to kill her husband.
Under a court order A. O. L. released information regarding Cassaday centuries computer activity.
Okay well verified the cherry injury were both signed on to the AOL service on the same day at the same time and for the same length of time as the instant message indicated.
Shuri also took steps to cover her tracks a day and a half after the killing of her husband she calls America online to change her first and last name to change her street address city state and zip code after she learned of the suicide of Jerry Cassaday she did the same thing.
And Jerry's home computer showed hundreds of emails from the screen name charade ten thirteen that had been deleted.
The data is still there until such time as the computer needs to write something new and the computers all that spots open all right there now.
And so the data resides on the car drive until it's over with.
Among a stack of papers on juries computer desk investigators found the name John o'connor which was misspelled and the telephone number injuries hand writing.
In the instant message witchery claimed was a fabrication Jerry Roach.
If anything happens to me call him John o'connor with the same the spelling and his telephone number which was also incorrect.
Certainly corroborates the fact that.
They had been communicating in that instant message it was one two quintillion chances that that alone.
Could have happened by coincidence that's nineteen zeros after the two the forensic computer analysis also revealed the motive for the murder in a moment how sure re Miller managed to fool a seasoned homicide investigator.
The rent six computer experts found proof that you remember and Gerry Cassidy conspired to kill sure res husband Bruce.
It was like reading a diary of the relationship it showed for saying things to this kind of really kind of bring is blind to opposes sexual emotional boil to really bring him in to her and her world and she was showing it to him.
Only a month after she reads marriage to Bruce Miller she met Gerry Cassidy in America online chat room.
The two struck up a friendship Jerry was going through a divorce sure we said she was on happy to.
Eventually they met face to face and became lovers.
When the two were a part.
Sure recap the spark in their relationship by sending Jerry Roddick pictures of herself through email.
She also recorded the video tape.
Later found by investigators in Jerry's trash.
At one point sure we told Jerry she was pregnant with twins and the jury was the father although she had had her tubes tied years earlier.
Chery emailed a picture of a positive pregnancy test she had taken from a friend and sonograms of the fetus which were actually taken five years earlier of her son.
Sure he claimed her husband Bruce was a member of organized crime a drug dealer and was physically abusive towards her.
There was no evidence that any of this was true.
She claimed Bruce had beat her so badly she miscarried Jerry's on born twins.
Sherri email Jerry pictures of her bruised and battered body a feat she accomplished with make up.
This is a situation woman very plodding lean purposefully created an artificial universe to cause this guy to believe that he would to be doing the quote unquote right thing to come and murder Bruce Miller.
He couldn't see.
What the truth was anymore and what was a lie he was going to be the white knight for Sri Miller he was gonna kill the dragon.
In an instant message Jerry injury made plans for the murder.
Chery said she would keep her husband on the phone about Jerry went in to kill him.
Telephone records confirmed this is precisely what happened.
Jerry'S experience as a homicide detective meant he could commit the crime while leaving no forensic evidence behind.
Just a few weeks after Bruce's merger.
She stopped answering his calls and emails.
And she found another boyfriend.
I think he was grief stricken.
What have I done what is she.
And for what she didn't give a darn about.
Among Jerry's personal papers was a suicide note addressed to his parents.
It was painfully obvious Jerry still believed most of sherry slice.
Keep the crap out of her and killed My Baby I'm sorry mom these are my babies I love them I wanted them I drove there and killed.
But Jerry finally realized he had been used.
I was so blind and so stupid and so much in love little did I know she never met any of it she just wanted all her money and no more husband Shuri was involved and help set it up I have all the proof.
To get what's coming.
There was no doubt you know Jerry city.
In a situation like this he he wasn't going to shoot himself and then leave this for somebody with if it wasn't for.
In December two thousand sure we went on trial for murder and conspiracy.
The forensic computer analysis was the state's primary evidence.
Did you help anybody kill your house you know I did not.
The July yes I did.
The first jury continued to maintain the instant messages were a forgery she claimed Jerry was the spurned lover and did this in an attempt to frame her.
Are you saying this entire instant message is fake yes I am so they talk about the deaths in the pictures on your back and legs and what not the bruises that has never had a conversation no I didn't.
But the forensic computer analysis proved otherwise and provided a possible motive for the murder.
Money from Bruce's life insurance policies and the sale of his junk yard business.
I told my wife that I think three's going from here to here the money she's going to get from this that was my thought maybe got killed.
Because she was that kind of person just a money hungry person right after the homicide she we did the house she spent a lot of money even down Bruce's mother bought her car with some of the money that was left her.
So money may have been a motive we we don't know prosecutors do not believe John Hutchinson had anything to do with Bruce Miller's merger.
In December of two thousand.
re Miller was found guilty of second degree murder and conspiracy to commit first degree murder.
She was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.
No respect for the man she she married that she had no respect for brother she had no respect for old kids put them through this.
She got what she deserved I've seen.
Gunshot wounds I've seen knife wounds I've seen dismemberment I've seen axe murders see people who've drug people buy cars killed by autos I have never seen anyone killed by computers.
For investigators the verdict was a triumph of high tech detective work and old fashioned gumshoe investigation.
If we have been unable to find hard evidence to back up the printouts the emails the instant messages.
We would not have had a case by doing the computer forensics we showed that a century Cassidy and what brought him to killing Bruce Miller and then taking his own life.
She thought she beat the system she thought she planned the perfect murder she thought those those things that she typed in never ever come back to haunt her.
But she was wrong.
