In four years time this man suffered the loss of two wives and his business went bankrupt.
Was it bad luck or as one forensic scientist asked was it too coincidental.
In nineteen ninety four thirty six year old timbers Caskey and his three children moved to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to begin a new life.
Just a few months earlier in North Carolina Tim suffered the deal loss of his business and the accidental death of his wife Elaine.
Tim started a small company to make crowns and bridges for local dentist.
And just seven months after the death of his wife he met thirty two year old merry and Fullerton.
She met him at a dance she came home all excited St them she met the most wonderful man at the Catholic singles club that night in all her friends figured you know they hadn't seen her that excited in a while and it just might be the person.
Merry and soon fell in love with him and his kids Randy sandy and taught.
And the couple married merry and included Tim's children in the ceremony.
She vowed to love them and cherish them and take care of them as long as she could she had to Randy.
She kissed sandy she kissed Todd and his very emotional when she said this printer.
Looking from the outside in you wouldn't have known that she wasn't you know I really mom mother per se.
But just eighteen months after the wedding.
Tragedy struck ten Boskalis ski yet again.
Shortly after midnight on November seventh nineteen ninety four ten pound his wife unconscious in the family hot top.
Marianne was rushed to the trauma center at Allegheny General Hospital but it was too late she was pronounced dead.
That'S probably the worst feeling in the world.
Tim told police that he and merry and went into the hot tub together around eleven o'clock.
They ignored all we're on aware of safety warnings that they should spend no longer than ten or fifteen minutes in the hot water.
And doctors warn against drinking alcohol than a hot.
He was really pushing the fact that she was drinking heavily thirteen to fifteen beers let's water beer.
Leader Kim left to take a shower and he said merry and stayed behind.
When Tim returned twenty minutes later.
If found Marianne's lifeless body in the water she was immersed in the hot tub spa that had a temperature of approximately one hundred four degrees the outside air in early November was in the thirties she probably attempted to get out of the tub and had an episode of light headedness because of your blood rushing out to the corporate strategies and had a fainting spell.
Fell into the tub and drowned.
Marianne'S blood alcohol level was point two two over twice the legal limit of intoxication it's never pleasant nor easy to to bash the deceased they're they're not here to defend themselves but the long and short of it in this case was that Merion Bosco ski did have a history of drinking she had to leave to the whites.
we had an episode where we had witnesses that were in the car with her church were concerned about her drinking once again Tim Boskalis gate was the weather where.
Lose both wives and a four year period.
On the night merry and Boskalis D. di police investigating the case were not sure whether it was a freak accident or something else.
On the hot tub to wet beach towels.
On the bottom of the tub lay the temperature gauge which had broken loose from its housing and care of women's eyeglasses.
On the deck officers also saw a weapon pack of cigarettes an ashtray two cops and a small box that held the breeding device team used to administer CPR on Marianne until paramedics arrived the device typically is used on strangers to prevent disease that was suspicious.
Personals right mind would want to use this device on his own wife.
And take the time to leave her alone atop the run down in the basement the farthest thing to bring it up.
Something else bothered police a scratch on Tim Boskalis keys neck detectives asked him to remove his shirt they saw on multiple scratches on both sides of his waist and shoulder and left arm and his left cheek and was Bruce the superficial scratches on his back did not bleed okay they were not surrounded by bruising or black and blue or hematoma contusions on his body there were just little scratches didn't necessarily take a I I train police officers to to figure out that there was really something wrong here.
Marianne'S family was suspicious they had heard rumors to Tim's first wife died under similar circumstances I ask Marianne I said I had heard that she had drowned in a bath.
She choked on something and I said what in the world was she in the bathtub that she would choke on and she said I don't know she said ten doesn't like to talk about it it gets too upset.
Police in Greensboro North Carolina confirmed the team's first wife Elaine died in a bath tub accident.
Four years earlier team said Alain was intoxicated when she came home from a church social function.
Alain went to take a bath Kim said he went to bed.
At the time the couple's daughter sandy was six years old both she and her father said they heard a loud noise in the bathroom I remember hearing.
I remember getting up and being the one who with my dad at.
Teams at the bathroom door was locked which he forced open with a screwdriver.
Inside he found his wife on her back in the bathtub unconscious submerged in the water Jim said he pulled her out of the top and placed her over the shower door tracks to try to revive her he later across the two thinking that he could get the water out of.
Because he felt like she had swallowed water and that was keeping her from breathing paramedics rushed to lane to the Wesley long community hospital where she was pronounced dead.
I admired her strength.
She had such beautiful qualities.
At the scene.
Eastbound vomit in the bathtub from Tim's resuscitation efforts no water in the tub or nearby how do you get around and not be with.
How do you get around and not be water everywhere.
Even the shower door tracks were completely dry.
Brenda Vance was a rookie police officer in nineteen ninety and the same size as Tim's first wife Elaine.
Disturbed by the lack of water in the bus the bathroom.
Vance conducted an experiment in your own home back.
The officer wanted to see how much water it took to submerge her head.
So that didn't make any sense to me.
The lane Boskalis skis autopsy revealed no water in the air away.
Just say water is not always present in the lines of drowning victim.
Three parallel lines mark the lower chest and upper abdomen.
Consistent with the shower door tracks on the Boskalis keys back.
The explanations that he offered for the marks on the body couldn't be refuted by the autopsy findings when he said I put her over the edge of the tub to to try to resuscitate or or an attempt to save her life well we we have a mark that's consistent with putting a body over the edge of the tub the toxicology report showed Elaine alcohol level was zero she was not in the brigade against him.
Despite the inconsistency.
ruled the cause of death undetermined white collar and term because I don't really believe a story but I can't say that it didn't happen that way but I'm suspicious but you know there's just not quite enough there I understand why she made the call that she did to begin with I think hitting at your question directly I think she did the best she could under the circumstances.
I also believe that that she probably felt very badly personally when the second woman that.
Kim Bosco ski got away with murder the first time.
Would he be lucky enough to get away with it again with wife number two.
Jambos kowski had been married two times both whites died under suspicious circumstances the first in a bath tub the second in a hot tub.
Friends and relatives say the two wives strongly resembled each other.
And that was another similarity both of them were very much involved in the Catholic Church the investigation into the death of Tim's first wife was inconclusive.
Investigators were hoping for more in the autopsy of ten second wife it is impossible to know exactly what happened but we can piece together some things in.
An intelligent and logical fashion the medical examiner found fifty three bruises externally and in turn.
On the upper arms the back and the upper neck.
We find some bruising and emerging on the lips and at the base of the gums at the inside bottom portion of the lips can we find these bruises on the arms that are strongly suggestive of fingernail impressions we do have several areas of focal hemorrhage in the neck in those small muscles we call strap muscles because they resemble small elongated rectangular straps and we find small hemorrhages in the surrounding soft tissues.
Pressure to the side of the neck halts the blood flow in the carotid artery to the brain and pressure to the vagus nerve alongside the carotid slows the heart muscles and respiration.
Brady cardia as we call it that slowing of the heart can set the stage in some instances uncontrollably unpredictably quite a radically of a cardiac a review and abnormal beating of the heart in other words the heart just stopped beating belongs and stop functioning and in a matter of forty six minutes your debt.
I think you know that Mister bush Kaski strangled her I think he pride pressure to her neck I think that he and held her arms he may well have held her underwater although we don't have any definitive evidence of prolonged immersion in water I think that day was a staged and drowning I think that the death was due to strangulation.
Marianne'S blood alcohol level.
Dr Wecht says being intoxicated made it difficult for Mary and to fight off her attacker the official ruling.
As negotiations you to compression of the neck as the medical evidence incontrovertible in our minds indicated he strangled her.
It'S not that easy to get away with something the second or third time that you try to do it.
Gift him murdered both of his wives as alleged what was the motive.
When prosecutors interviewed Marianne Boskalis keys family and friends they learned that came and merry and had recently been on a cruise and all was not happy Merian said if things don't get better.
When I by the time I get back I can always leave and I'm taking the children with me there was evidence Tim's first wife Elaine was planning to divorce him as well.
As a grown woman in her thirties a mother she was discovering rock and roll from the sixties and seventies she was really pursuing.
Wholeness as an individual.
James first wife had no life insurance to speak on ten purchased a one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy on his second wife.
If then when the time came if he ever had to kill or he would do it next time you have a lot more money than you got the first time.
Even after these two suspicious death the children steadfastly defended their father.
Tim Bosco ski was arrested and charged with first degree murder in the deaths of his first wife Elaine and his second wife Marianne Moscow ski insisted he was innocent.
The evidence does not support that charge.
Prosecutors in Greensboro believed him follow the lane into the bathroom that night in nineteen ninety a later interview with one of the children revealed there was an argument.
Before Elaine got into the shower Tim Forster over the edge of the tub and held her there for four or five minutes preventing her from breathing.
At some point in the struggle Alain vomited before she died.
The lack of water in and around the back top and the bruises on a plane's body told a tale of violence.
Tim second marriage to Mary and there were problems once more.
Got away with the first one get away with this one.
Prosecutors believe Timman merry and argued in the hot top possibly about her drinking or interest in having children.
The evidence suggests team quickly overpowered Marianne possibly covering her head with the beach towels to muffle her screams.
Marianne fought for her life splashing water on to the desk and scratching teams back.
He knew from the first merger that strangulation victims sometimes vomit this may be why use the CPR mouth piece in Mary Ann's case as protection while performing CPR when paramedics arrived charade and all just to play the acting.
It was terrible actor by the way.
Team'S defense lawyer says that his client had no motive to kill his wife.
Tim'S business up here was successful a new house things were going well for them the only bone of contention that anybody could point to at the time was that they had some arguments over the kids and if that's the other reason to charge a man with murder then we're in trouble.
In the Greensboro case and the Pittsburgh case teams defense claimed that both of his wives had underlying heart conditions cause accidental death.
If you believe in fairy godmothers and things like that and you're prepared to believe that something with a hundred million to one odds it can happen then maybe you could argue that.
In Greensboro North Carolina the jury found him Boskalis ski guilty in the first degree murder of a lane wife number one.
He was sentenced to life in prison.
In the murder trial of merry and wife number two it was the same verdict guilty.
I was always against the death penalty.
Having lived through the situation.
Team boss because he continues to maintain his innocence.
His children say their father didn't receive fair trials because jurors in both cases heard about both deaths well without forensics of course this case would have been missed and if a case like this happens in a jurisdiction in which there is no competent forensic pathologist it could well be best you know the marks on the neck very very subtle very minimal.
She left a message for all us with trauma but her body to prove that this was an accidental drowning he basically told the same story twice with two wives you know in both cases neither story hell water you know so it was basically just always.
