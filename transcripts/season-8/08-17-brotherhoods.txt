Two men were murdered while sleeping in their bed.
One night later an arson fire destroyed a family planning clinic.
Investigators wondered whether some shards of glass paint chips and chicken thighs could link what appeared to be two separate crimes.
On the morning of July first nineteen ninety nine Oscar match and called his son Gary.
No one answered the phone.
But there was an unusual message on the answering machine.
And at that point they became very concerned.
Family members drove out to Gary's home.
Came up to the house and called loudly nobody answered we walked in and saw a foot sticking out on the bed.
Every point you realize what happened Gary and his partner Winfield monitor had been shot to death in their loft bed with a twenty two caliber pistol.
It was just a tremendous shock when I you know I don't know that I was ever in the miles in instant depression.
The trail of empty cartridge cases and the location of the blood spatter told investigators where the shooter had stored.
Shooter walked towards a loft I think the people in the loft got up to see what was going on and then they start being shot and the shooter got closer to the law and then basically finish them off.
There was an overfilled basically with each of them being shot multiple times like that it was like somebody was trying to send a signal to us or there was something that they want to say about how they killed these people.
The killer then recorded a new message on the telephone answering machine saying the two men were away on a trip.
The autopsy revealed Gary in Winfield were killed between midnight and four AM.
Winfield'S car was missing from their home along with Gary's credit card and driver's license.
Gerry'S family didn't believe the murder was a random act.
We felt very strongly early on that it was a hate crime they were murdered because they were gay because they both were.
They were active in in gay rights issues so and we we just had a strong feeling we just knew it was a hate crime I did anyway.
You know everybody was looking over their shoulders you know wondering what was going on if they would be next I think the fact that someone goes into your home and she cheated death in your bed disturb everybody in this community.
Gerri Mattson and Winfield mount or had lived together for sixteen years and owned a landscaping and nursery business they have no known enemies.
Six days after the murders police found Winfield's car on a deserted road about one hundred miles away.
Gary match since driver's license and credit card we're not inside.
Investigators asked the bank when the credit card was last used.
And they got a surprise the card had been used after Gary's murder to purchase some gun related equipment.
They had purchased almost two thousand dollars and reloading equipment ammunition reloading equipment and the person that had made the purchase had requested that it be sent to a PO box in Yuba city.
That is really done.
A little still dumb things you have to wonder whether they have a.
Investigators set up surveillance hoping the killers would walk into their trap.
When Winfield motoring Kerry Madsen were murdered the only items missing from their home in one match since driver's license and credit card.
Immediately after the murders match since credit card was in use.
They used the victim's credit cards within hours of the.
The murders were.
Probably committed around three o'clock in the morning on July first and that same day in the afternoon the spend about a thousand dollars a shoe store.
And the credit card was also used to purchase some gun related equipment.
Person using the card at the item shipped to a post office box in a town about a two hour drive away.
Police headed straight to the address where the items had been shipped sure enough they saw two men carrying boxes out to their car.
They were identified as thirty two year old Matthew Williams and his twenty nine year old brother Tyler.
Inside the car detectives found Gary maxims credit card and driver's license.
In the brothers home police found several newspaper articles about an arson spree that occurred two weeks before Gerry and win fields murder.
Three synagogues burned on the same night all our sins.
And that each one.
Eight literature littered the crime scenes the flyers were found kind of randomly dispersed thrown throughout the synagogue and also on the outside as well then in almost a random fashion.
Police found similar literature in the boy's apartment.
Thousands of pages of literature anti semitic literature.
Gas chromatography identified the chemical makeup of the excel and used in the arsons.
In the boy's possession was a book on our sins which recommended the same chemical mixture.
A second book describes the best techniques for breaking and entering.
It describes the best times to break in between the hours of two AM and four AM at all our sins were within that time frame.
And the third book recommended wearing coveralls to commit crime.
Investigators found cover roles in the brother's closet similar to the ones the book recommended.
Investigators found nothing in the Williams home that tied them to the murders of Gary Matson and Winfield louder but they found other forensic evidence.
I looked out the suspect's car first in probably the only thing that I recovered that was of significance was class.
The glass appeared to be safety glass the type used in windows and doors.
When it breaks you actually have hundreds of notes thousands of small particles of plastic that will come back towards the the person breaking glass in it'll become embedded in your clothing even though you can't see it.
In the trunk of the car were two black crowbars one had green paint scrape marks.
Could forensic scientists make any scientific connection between the murders arsons and the Williams brothers.
It'S hard to describe the one to see especially.
The film footage of the today Israel and the flames pouring out of the structure.
Initially we worked out the extremist groups in the Sacramento area there were several groups such as neo Nazi skinhead.
hate groups that had in the past vandalized synagogues and other houses of worship.
They inadvertently found evidence linking their murder suspects to the arson fires set three California synagogues in the same night.
All of the evidence from Matthew and Tyler Williams car and department was sent to criminalist face Springer an expert in trace evidence.
She started with the glass shards found in the suspect's car.
This is not an organic material so it's it's just made from.
Silicon dioxide Sam basically and melted so glass varies a lot by.
Depending on how it's made and what materials go into making it.
Three wavelengths of visible light.
Ask through the glass the reflection of that light is measured under the refracted light index.
Springer compared the glass in the suspect's car to the broken glass at the synagogues.
Glass the person at the synagogue was similar to class in the suspect vehicle it was the same type of glass and had the same physical properties and chemical properties blue coveralls found in the Williams brothers home also contain glass fragments.
So did to other objects found in the brother's car.
The crow bars were sent down to my laboratory tests we suspected that their synagogue arsons who either used crowbars or bats eventually we found a some glass fragments that were similar to glass that was collected.
Microscopic examination of the crowbars also revealed green paint.
So I called and asked him you know.
Where is the green paint came from because I knew none of the synagogue on I'd been to all of them and they said well the only thing that we have is this fire at this.
Medical clinic office building.
The medical office building was actually an abortion clinic which had burned the day after Gary and win fields murder.
The abortion clinic had green trim around the doors where the arsonist entered the building.
Springer compared the samples to the paint on the crowbar using pyrolysis gas chromatography what it does is it allows you to look at the organic profile of the paint in with paint so it's not just one chemical that goes into making a payment.
The paint on the crowbar at the same chemical composition as the paint from the abortion clinic.
So there we had a double transfer from the medical clinic going to the macro bar in that crowbar going to that synagogue.
And forensic scientists got lucky with some other evidence not all of the fire bombs placed inside the synagogues ignited.
Extremely fortuitous that you would have on burnt material left at a crime scene.
The surviving fire bombs were plastic containers of flammable liquid with home made wicks made of cloth.
But in the class for some unusual items including dog hair cat hairs and even check and that is.
When Springer went to the Williams home.
She knew she had something.
They had three dogs they had a chicken coop in the back taking the chicken samples wasn't easy.
In terms of their flopping all over the place and then we get the loose for others.
To hear from the Williams dog and cat as well as the chicken feathers were microscopically consistent with their hair and feather evidence contained in the wake of the fire upon.
And the chemical make up of the light blue paint on the Williams family tool shed matched the blue paint found on one of the synagogue firebombs.
It was just too many coincidences the the feathers the dogs the same kind of pain.
I had a lot of confidence in.
These materials were going to show that the bottles came from them.
With the synagogue and the portion twenty dollars to solve there were still two remaining questions.
Did the Williams brothers killed Gary and Winfield and was there forensic evidence to prove it.
After the two Williams brothers were linked to the four California arson fires investigators still needed to solve the murders of Jerry Mattson and wind field Molitor.
What we wanted to do was to see a forensically.
We could get evidence that would at a later time lead us and help us proof which individuals committed the crimes.
Detectives searched a small cottage behind the Williams brothers parents home and found guns and a book on how to make homemade silencer.
A twenty two caliber pistol in the brothers possession at the same homemade silencer.
This had some great tape or duct tape on the end of it and had a small hole in the into that.
And you could actually visually see light through that whole.
On the end of the tape.
Was a tiny speck of blood.
Which was sent to the lab for DNA analysis.
One of the victims was.
A couple feet of the victim when it was fired to put that smaller droplets on the end of that.
He said take mark Fisher process the Williams gotten.
Hi the process was a mark two twenty two caliber pistol.
Which I developed three politely oppression promotions and ultimately identified all three as the main by James Tyler Williams the younger brother.
Was this the gun used to kill Winfield and Gary.
Firearms experts test fired the twenty two caliber pistol and compared those spent cartridges with those found in Kerry and Winfield.
Based on this comparison.
Finally the DNA testing of the blood found on the end of that pistol confirmed the blood was Winfield monitors.
The Williams brothers lived only a few miles from the home Gary in Winfield shared.
Prosecutors believe the Williams brothers targeted the couple because they were gay.
Matthew Williams new wind field model because they had worked together briefly at the local farmers market.
Investigators also discovered the brothers were heavily influenced by groups that expressed contempt for days Jews minorities and abortion rights.
They are absolutely a part of that extremist Christian movement that strongly believes that homosexuals are evil scourge of the earth.
On September eighth two thousand and one.
The Williams brothers pled guilty to arson.
While awaiting trial Matthew Williams committed suicide is just fine with me that he killed himself that's fine with me except for the fact that it could have been nice to have him.
Stand up in court and let the world see what kind of a person he was.
Although they did kill two individuals and cause millions of dollars worth of destruction they failed to ignite this so called revolution this uprising against against certain institutions his younger brother Tyler pled guilty to arson and first degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.
Every year on the anniversary of Winfield and Gary's death.
There'S a celebration of life and diversity in Redding California.
Today in memory of Gary in Winfield I ask all of you to begin teaching respect for people's differences.
This was a case where the forensic evidence identified trail.
From the abortion clinic and blast from the synagogue is transferred on to the two crow bars found in the suspect's strong.
All identified by forensic scientist who often see evidence that to others looks like.
Weather ain't chips are the glass fragments that dog here's where the chicken feathers each one is an independent action and so then it becomes very significant when you have multiple independent actions all associated with the same flex is great for us because it.
It helps prove the case at the same time.
Well it's it's made my job easier it's made it harder for criminals to get away with Iraq's even smart ones.
