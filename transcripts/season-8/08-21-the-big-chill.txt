Hi Carol Heller went to the hospital thirty one times complaining of various ailments that are doctors thought were all in your head.
That is until she died.
This is how a forensic toxicologist and a middle aged woman in a cheerleader's outfit cracked the only known case of its kind in the history of forensic science.
After her divorce Carol Heller moved to the small town of Perry Oklahoma to be closer to our family.
With only five thousand residents and almost no violent crime.
Seems like a good place to start over.
Carol was fighting a lifelong battle with manic depression also known as bi polar disorder.
Caroling became active in the local church and developed a circle of friends it wasn't enough.
There are a lot of people who don't feel fulfilled unless they have a spouse they they want someone in their life and she wanted a man in her life.
So Carol decided to place a personal ad in a local Christian newspaper she was looking for a Christian male person who could take charge of the household debt finances and Dennis was the one that answered the A. and.
Dennis Heller was a fifty one year old handyman.
When the two started dating Carol's family made sure Dennis was aware of her past my parents talked to him about it so he was aware that she had had cinema mental health problems.
Within a year Carol and Dennis were married.
And it wasn't long before some of Carol's old demons resurfaced should one away from our house and and we would go find her and take her back home sometimes you end up in emergency room at the hospital sometimes she was taken to a mental health facility a free evaluation they're trying to get out good oral medications.
And my dad asked her one time.
Six zero have you ever thought about killing yourself and she says.
Well yes she said I have thought about it before.
Doctors prescribed lithium a common medication for bipolar disorder.
Like maybe a lot of people with the bi polar she had a lot of manic phases but as far as being real depressed.
She she handled it pretty good the medication cause nausea drowsiness and slurred speech doctors reduced her dosage of lithium but her symptoms persisted.
To get relief Carol sought the advice of other doctors but none were able to help her.
She had been in Perry still arm Tonka Oakland city in Denver Colorado hospitals in those ten months I thank the doctors and nurses who treated her intended to turn around after a while to get to the hospital amid stabilizer and made.
Just determine that they either had solved the problem or couldn't figure out what the problem was and they sent her home in a month later it would start again it would happen again.
Carol'S health problems were also causing strains in her new marriage.
When I talked to Carol she was just so down and out she said I think Dennis is getting disgusted with me she said I have been sick the whole time we have been married.
Carol was convinced that it was the lithium that was causing these symptoms so against doctor's orders she stopped taking the medication all together.
That'S what her problems really started.
Sunday about a year after her marriage Carol Heller was uncharacteristically absent from church.
Her husband Dennis told the congregation that Carol's condition had taken a turn for the worse.
Later that night.
For an ambulance.
Carol was in a coma so they transported her by helicopter to a larger hospital in Oklahoma City some sixty miles away.
About an hour later I got a phone call when the phone rang and knew what funds.
Carol had never regained consciousness.
Doctors believe Carol died of natural causes.
Also the death was congestive heart failure that's what they believe that she died from.
The medical examiner was overwhelmed with cases from the Oklahoma City bombing which it happened just six weeks earlier.
Many of the one hundred sixty eight victims of that blast still work unidentified.
So no autopsy was performed on Carol Heller in accordance with her wishes Carol's body was cremated that was her wish so my dad said there was no sense of bombing her.
In a town as small as Perry.
News of Carroll's death spread quickly.
So did word of her husband's insensitivity.
When the M. S. crew arrived at his home.
Dennis was on the couch on the telephone when they walked in and he did not acknowledge them or do you speak to them.
He did not respond so they went looking through their apartment and found curled unconscious in a coma.
And it was another peculiar incident at Carol's funeral service Dennis was sitting back in behind us about four rows or so.
And of course we got reports said he had been does enough to sleep during the memorial service.
The jury is about the situation detective Farrow went to the Heller's apartment with the building manager told him and even more bizarre story.
The day before Carroll's death she saw huge flames coming from the outdoor grill behind the couple's apartment she thought at first he was cooking something but then after he went back and she had looked into the grill and there was nothing in there but a bunch of pieces of paper so she really won sure what he was doing out there but and this was all prior to Carol's death.
And later that same night the apartment manager saw Dennis carrying boxes and boxes of trash to the dumpster.
Thorough discovered those boxes were filled with Carroll's personal items found a Bible that belonged to Carroll was a gift from her father and it was very cold so you could tell it was an heirloom there were some documents original letters how got there just I mean just basic stuff that you would find in someone's you know drawers you know like dresser drawers and stuff that have been tossed in the air.
But why would Dennis dispose of Carroll's belongings on the day before she died.
In the Heller's apartment investigators found something on in the kitchen pantry.
of anti freeze.
I'Ve never known anyone keeping a freeze in the kitchen garage yes but not a kitchen.
But according to Dennis it was Carol's idea to keep the anti freeze in the kitchen he said that she had drank half a gallon of anti freeze back in November.
And he had bought a new gallon of anti freeze and half of it was gone so he thought that.
Corroborating this unusual story was the fact that Dennis told Carol sisters the same thing shortly before her death.
He said I found some anti freeze sing carols closet and some of its gone you know it just really flew all over me why would somebody mentioned something like that.
Yet on the night Carol died doctors found absolutely no sign of ethylene glycol systems which is the primary ingredient devante free.
If investigators suspected foul play they had no way to prove it since there had been no autopsy and Carol's body had already been cremated.
I'M assigned detective David Farrell joined forces with his colleague buzz buzz bait to look into a suspicious death the fifty two year old Carol Heller.
Almost everyone they talked to told stories about Dennis Heller is unusual behavior both before and after Carroll's death.
To get to the bottom of the mystery Busby and Farrow sifted through four thousand pages of Carol Heller is medical records.
To organize the materials they use the spare courtroom and sorted the records by month.
Each chair represented a different month in Carol's life.
When all the records were arranged the chair representing March of nineteen ninety five was empty this was just three months before her death.
We can understand that.
Since we haven't had a chance to go through the records to read all of them yet why would there not be records on those records for every other month.
They soon discovered a possible explanation.
In March of nineteen ninety five Dennis Heller was in jail in Oklahoma City for shoplifting.
District attorney mark Gibson responded to the news with caution.
Well my policy has always been that I will not file charges on the case of any kind until I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that I have evidence to show someone beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was committed.
And a little deeper and Carol's medical records investigators found another shortly before her death Carol went to a hospital fifty miles away in Ponca city complaining of slurred speech and confusion.
Dr Dani Cassidy treated Carol that day and found evidence that the acid levels and Carol's bloodwork elevated a condition known as metabolic acidosis when he saw the elevated metabolic acidosis levels.
He realized that there was only a couple of things that would cause that.
In response Dr Cassidy ordered more tests I was testing for other unusual forms of acidosis things like methanol.
Please what alcohol that is highly toxic.
Dr Cassidy told Carol those test results would take about a week but Carol didn't want to wait for the results.
She did not want to be in the hospital and she didn't represent a threat to anyone or to herself and so she could not be forcibly detained to be in the hospital and so she left willingly with her husband.
Gas chromatography tests found ethylene glycol and Carol system six milligrams per deciliter.
Sadly Carol was already dead by the time her personal physician got the results.
Now there was an even bigger question.
Did the ethylene glycol get into Carol system.
We'Ve never found another case in the United States or anywhere for that matter where someone was gradually being poisoned with antifreeze.
But investigators had no way of knowing whether Caroline just did it intentionally and accrued suicide attempt or whether her husband had poisoned her.
To find out investigators look for an expert in anti freeze poisoning.
We took his book we contacted some of the people in there and sing like everybody we talked to and kind of give them our story they pointed us to doctor published in in Virginia.
Noted toxicologist Dr Alphonse poke places one of the world's foremost authorities on ethylene glycols.
He reviewed Carol Heller's medical records and immediately noticed a discrepancy.
Carol told doctors she had slurred speech confusion a lack of coordination Norcia and dehydration.
Doctors attributed this to listen.
But the symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning were virtually identical this is almost a great tragedy is you read the medical records the sicker she gets the more she becomes convinced the medications of physicians are given are making a real the more she complains about it the more the physicians thank god she's becoming paranoid.
The six milligrams of ethylene glycol found in Carroll system was about one third the lethal dose.
Doctor Popa says this amount is consistent with slow poisoning not suicide.
That'S a strange way to commit suicide I don't know anybody that's going to poison themselves with Aveling glide call arsenic or anything and make themselves repeatedly yield for nine or ten months to kill.
But there was no scientific evidence to prove Dr publicist hypothesis there'd been no autopsy Carol's body had been cremated and there was no ethylene glycol in her blood the night she died.
It appeared that if Dennis Heller had poisoned his wife with anti freeze he was going to get away with it.
Investigators in Perry Oklahoma faced a dilemma.
Gas chromatography found six milligrams of ethylene glycol and Carol Heller system just a few weeks before she died.
At least on fourteen different occasions Dennis Heller would talk to people about Anna freeze.
And the effects of it have on you if you drink it one of the common things he would say and it seems like this was always out of context I'm not sure what context discussing average closing would be appropriate the people would say we were talking.
And this just came up with a statement did you know that one teaspoon of antifreeze taken everyday for ten days will kill you.
So investigators tried a different tack they knew that Dennis Heller spent quite a bit of time in Oklahoma city about sixty miles away he had a girlfriend there for most of the time he was married.
Her name was Karen Dawson and she was more than willing to talk to police after Caroline.
The girlfriend kind of put it all together and was very willing to work with us to assist us in any way she could he had actually taken Carol's wedding rings down to care and to have her try Iman this is prior to her death had Karen to try these things on to see how they because that would soon be hers according to Dennis.
Karen told police that Dennis was attracted to girls wearing cheerleaders outfits and he bought one in a second hand store.
It'S a lemon yellow nineteen sixties cheerleading outfit with pleats that he gave to her that he had bought for Carol to work at fifty three years old.
Investigators convinced Karen to wear that cheerleader's outfit on the couple's next date along with a hidden microphone.
The two went to a drive in restaurant.
Undercover officers listened from a van across the street.
Karen began by telling Dennis that if they were to have any kind of a life together Dennis would have to be completely honest with her.
Karen asked Dennis if he had anything to do with his wife's death.
I put it in her food myself and detective for or listening on a receiving device even describe how I done it with an eye dropper at center.
That was a huge moment that was a confession.
Have to lean fly call as a distinctive taste and odor.
How Dennis placed anti freeze and carols food without detection will not be revealed in this program.
Surprisingly when investigators arrested Dennis Heller he wasn't at all concerned he did say to the investigators that it only takes one person on a journey with reasonable doubt.
And slow poisoning is hard to prove Dennis Heller thought he'd commit the perfect murder he thought he'd cover his tracks medically.
But there was one thing he hadn't counted on.
Also there hadn't been an autopsy on Carol due to the Oklahoma City bombing the medical examiner took some tissue samples for analysis.
When tested he found calcium oxalate crystals in her brain and kidney samples.
Prolonged exposure to ethylene glycol can cost calcium oxalate crystals to form causing renal failure and death they were getting clogged up.
She probably got a pretty good does.
Two days before she died from what we know.
He'S a cold hearted killer is what he is.
And anyone who can sit around and say somebody suffer I cunning stand to see an animal suffer all that time much less your spouse.
But what was his motive Dennis was a sure means than Carol she had apartment Shekar she had a J. C. penny's life insurance policy or at least Dennis believes that she did he wanted what she had and he water all the way.
When confronted with this forensic evidence Dennis Heller played guilty to manslaughter in return he was sentenced to life in prison.
Had it not been for investigators persistence one doctor's suspicions and the cheerleader's outfit Dennis Heller might have gotten away with murder in all those visits to doctors.
That'S one of the most fascinating things about the case from my perspective is that there is a simple relatively simple test that will detect it.
Carol'S family credits forensic science for bringing Dennis Heller to justice I would like to say to the doctor have finally figured out what was going on thank you very much.
From the whole family from the bottom of our hearts and I hope that is say some lines and I hope that this program will save more lives and people.
They tipped off to symptoms data.
What is happening.
I don't think deters anything that we can't find or do we use for instance.
Anyone who was going to commit a crime.
You know you're gonna leave something you're gonna say something we're gonna find it one way or the other by using forensics.
