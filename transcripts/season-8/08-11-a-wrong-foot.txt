Police in Illinois a search for a killer who was careful enough not to leave fingerprints.
To mask his identity.
This is how a forensic scientist with some fancy footwork identified a perpetrator when not one but two witnesses.
July nineteenth nineteen ninety one was typically hot and humid in Peoria Illinois once the sun set and the temperatures subsided it was a perfect night for a cookout.
Only had the windows open in fact does something G. C. Johnson and a roommate Jennifer logs then spent the evening with Jennifer's fiance Tommy Smith.
After we ate dinner we went to the grocery store and got stuff to make blizzards.
They all watched a Stephen King horror movie and less than fifteen minutes later Jennifer fell asleep.
The songs that didn't come from the television second here screening she turned and saw the writing an intruder was armed with a knife Casey ran to the phone to call police.
You need for police arrived the intruder wounded tiny band he went after Jennifer just kept screaming he just can't stay out of male.
Incredibly grabbed a knife from her assailant five stars thank.
Twice and just last Friday.
He then found Casey in the bedroom on the phone.
Jennifer managed to run to a neighbor's home for help I can't.
When the police arrived the intruder was gone.
But it was too late for twenty one year old Tommy Smith.
He was pronounced dead at the scene Jennifer and Casey were rushed to Saint Francis Medical Center.
My father came to get me at work and.
He told me that Tom had been killed.
And I I immediately freaked out in in disbelief you know no it wasn't him you know not Tommy.
And it was a soon after that that it is finally sunk in that you know he was he was killed.
Talisman section work quite a rowing he took it upon herself to apprehend the suspect put him in a chair and stand over top from holding there until police arrived.
And in doing so a sacrifice fly.
I don't think Tommy could have ever lived with one of them getting killed especially Jennifer.
Please hold the two girls would be able to identify their attacker.
Connie Smith had to do what every parent dreads.
And the funeral of a child.
This little boy loving young man.
He would've made a great dad.
Tommy'S fiancee Jennifer was in the intensive care unit near deaths she had sustained multiple stab wounds cut throat and a punctured lung.
If Tommy Smith would've been in that house.
those those two young ladies would be here today they'd be dead.
And I I believe that.
The crime scene gave testimony to the girls intense will to survive.
He really did a number on both of the young ladies they both exhibit a great deal of courage they had very strong constitution they had a very strong will to live.
Gradually their conditions improved but when they spoke to police they could remember very little.
You just can't stab at me all over and into nothing hurt but I and I didn't see any blood either she did state that a black male had entered the home she wasn't sure how.
And I can't remember what he looked like investigators would have to rely on the crime scene for clues they quickly concentrated their attention on the assailants point of entry a bedroom window.
The outside screen was jarred not a place and and cut investigators were shocked by the amount of blood found in the home.
Once you started cutting he went into a frenzy.
And at that point he felt the only way that.
Prevent the police from finding out who did this to these kids was to kill all three of.
One of the bedrooms amid the clutter police found a wooden handle of the murder weapon.
When the handle of the knife was located.
At the crime scene it speaks.
Of our suspects panic in his.
This is Johnson grabbed the blade of the knife and was able to break it loose from the handle.
Unfortunately there were no fingerprints on.
Police found a party invitation on the floor near the point of entry police use black magnetic powder to see if the killer may have knocked it to the floor during the struggle.
They were looking for the friction ridges of a fingerprint.
On top of the friction ridges are porous and that's where the perspiration comes from when the person sweats and when they touch an item they may or may not leave their identification to those unique characteristics.
On the invitation.
Gary Stevens all found what appeared to be a partial palm print.
Print that did not belong to me Jennifer Casey.
While interviewing neighbors police were surprised to learn that despite the girl screens no one saw the killer leave the crime scene.
Police thought they had solved the case when they found blood on the screen door of the neighbor's home Jean brown.
And he explained that he had cut himself on the.
On the lower leg carrying the garbage up earlier test revealed the blood was brown and investigators found broken glass in his trash can which brown said had caused the caught.
Brown'S palm print did not match the print on the party invitation at the crime scene.
Neither Jennifer nor Casey identified their next door neighbor as the assailant.
Police suspected the killer lived nearby since he fled the scene on foot.
And it was the foot which would lead police to the killer.
Gary C. but not all refused to give up in the search for Tommy Smith's killer in reviewing the case even call recall something Jennifer and Casey had both remembered about the intruder.
I ended up taking the knife away from him because he had socks wrapped around his hand.
She did describe him as wearing she thought khaki shorts he was also described as being a black male.
Actually six foot six foot one slim build with a mustache.
And the girls remembered something else the intruder was barefoot.
Why would a killer enter a home wearing socks on his hands but nothing on his feet.
And if the killer live nearby.
Why didn't the coverage face.
He'S breaking into a home where people can recognize and will certainly recognize.
And I think that the fact that he went in there quietly armed with a knife.
His intention all along was to do great harm to both young ladies are living there.
But the fact that he was barefoot quickly became the central focus of the investigation.
That leads a little insight into what the strange Pratt was on the cards.
Because it didn't look like a palm print to the crime scene investigators of something strange that they really had.
I hadn't seen before suddenly it occurred to see beneath all that the print on the party invitation might not be a palm print at all.
If you look at all of certain parts of the home they they can mimic of parts of the foot because they are the same characteristics they help all dots short rages and bifurcations and try for cations was it possible that the perpetrator not the party invitation to the floor and then stepped on it.
If so the hot muggy July night created the perfect conditions for leaving a print behind.
Simmons hall began the painstaking task of identifying the print.
Using a microscope and the pointer he examined the friction ridges every bifurcation and try for cation which are points where one line divides into two or three.
Police have a fingerprint database they can refer to but they don't collect footprints.
On a hunch police asked the girls next door neighbor Jean brown for his.
We took his foot prints to research one the taking foot press is something that the average person doesn't have to do when they're taken into custody.
You have to look for the uniqueness of those points of identification and we found it all on the outside left heel print gene Autry brown.
It was the first time in the history of the Peoria police department that a footprint had been recovered from a crime scene.
Why he'd had no shoes on I'll have no idea but.
It was a very smart it wasn't the smartest thing you can do the average person doesn't realize that their foot prints in fact are inherent to that particular person they are as individualistic as fingerprints are.
As well off to leave the socks on his feet.
And for another pair of hands.
In a search of brown's home.
Police discovered a set of knives which were identical to the murder weapon.
And they also found Casey Johnson's purse.
Police found bloody socks with the broken blade of the murder weapon inside.
And in one of the socks was Jean brown's wedding ring.
Finally investigators found tiny traces of blood in brown's hair he must've had a great deal of blood on him when he left.
The house after attacking the three individuals.
And he had still had blood on his body DNA tests of the blood sample showed it was from all three victims Tommy Jennifer and Casey.
Jeanne brown was arrested and charged with murder.
He had a family that cared for him.
You know because he chose drugs he took my son away from me.
Entered the house.
Do you understand that you have the right to remain silent and you do not have to talk to me or answer any questions unless you voluntarily choose to do so.
Yeah when police confronted Jean brown with the mountain of evidence against him for the murder of twenty one year old Tommy Smith and the attacks on Jennifer Luxton and Casey Johnson and.
It was more or less he was trying to get denied when I was trying to keep the night but at the same time.
Is being cut.
Say about forty five seconds.
Walked away fell to the floor.
Brown admitted to using crack cocaine on the day of the attack.
After having dinner with his wife and infant son brown said he needed the money to buy more cocaine.
my clothes on.
Right next door.
He removed his shoes so we could walk quietly and used his socks to cover his hands to make sure he didn't leave any fingerprints.
He entered the victim's home through an open window by removing the screen.
But he never realized his feet could leave the very same prince as his fingers just as distinctive just as incriminating.
Tommie Smith for valiantly but was no match for brown's knife.
Jennifer slipped out of the house when brown was in the other room T. C. survived by playing dead after she was attacked.
Prompt medical attention save them.
Tommie Smith's best friend still struggles with the absurdity of it all.
They discussed in me that somebody would take a life like that for a dollar.
So he could go get high it was very very senseless very sense of fact.
You know losing him so early what made it bearable was he had twenty years in him join everyone up he knew how to enjoy a long time despite his confession there are still parts of brown's story detectives don't believe.
Jennifer and Casey live next door to brown police think the brown broke in with the intent to rape and kill the two girls and didn't realize the Tommy Smith had stayed over that night.
He deliberately went to barefoot just a stop and hold the noise down.
He wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints.
Took a knife with him that was still in case in a cardboard sheet so that he would not injure himself.
He took no it made no effort whatsoever to cover his face.
And he's going into the home next door.
To take a life hand hand let alone attempting three.
He went from.
In exchange for his guilty plea Jeanne brown was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Tommie Smith and thirty years for each count of attempted murder.
He did this.
In order to escape chance of facing the death penalty in a trial.
It was a capital case and.
Like probably was a good move on his part.
Little did Jean brown no the Tommy Smith's mother would not have pushed for the death penalty.
I could not stand the thought.
Have another mother standing over a casket with her son so cold.
Kevin a son in prison for the rest of his life is bad nothing is worse than very.
Know where to begin.
But at the same time people protect himself for not being able to recall just what occurred.
Jennifer Logsdon is now married with children but she still lives with emotional and physical scars from that attack.
And I can't forgive him yet.
When you get caught doing something he said I'm sorry.
Would you say you're sorry if you get caught.
I don't know I I don't believe that each.
If Jean brown hadn't gone barefoot that night investigators wouldn't have recovered the valuable footprint that placed him at the crime scene.
Well I think it's the greatest army of all be so smart to get caught just because the show is the best laid plans of mice and men.
He in fact.
Try to going barefoot.
So that he would be quiet and be able to move through the house quietly in fact left behind tremendous piece of evidence when you're able to point out to your suspect that they in fact to the best witness that we have against themselves in the case of this particular footprint let's let it COS.
