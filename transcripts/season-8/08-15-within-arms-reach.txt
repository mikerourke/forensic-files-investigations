Police officer and his estranged wife have a fight in their bedroom.
He says it was suicide investigators said it was murder there's only two people that know and one can't speak with us.
Ballistics last will and the physics of a shop pedal to tell what really happened in the bedroom that day.
In the desolate beauty of northwest New Mexico the city of Farmington is one of the few green spots.
The streets are generally quiet traffic problems are usually handled by police on motorcycles.
All done used to be one of those officers.
I love my job always you say there's only two things I was good at it's been a traffic cop.
And being a dad and I enjoyed most all the simplicity of the animal cop because everything you do an axe investigation accident reconstruction this is man.
It was a good motor officer good police officer took his job you know real serious.
I was married to Monica Sanchez don and together the couple had to show.
She was the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life.
But after several years of marriage there were problems.
Monica discovered Paul was having an affair with another woman and the couple separated.
Early on the morning of April fourth nineteen ninety four with Fulham was on duty and heard a police radio call about a shooting at old and Monica's house.
I saw Paul performing CPR on Monica and he was just covered in blood.
The girl was rushed to the hospital.
But it was too late she was pronounced dead on arrival with a gunshot wound to our app.
Paul told police he went to the house to have breakfast with his daughters.
As he walked in.
It was just about ready to leave for work when they met.
She said and filing charges on and I said.
She said I'm filing charges on you for battery.
Stormed off down.
Through the living room and down the hallway in.
Into the bedroom and slammed the bedroom door.
All followed Monica to the bedroom.
Said he picked her up ran to the garage for the driver to the hospital but he wasn't sure there was enough.
His friends on the police force.
Leave the suicide story you know I suppose anything's anything's possible but I always have that philosophy there's only two people that know and one can't speak with us.
Investigators needed to analyze the forensic evidence in the bedroom to determine whether Paul's incredible story was true.
Since it's all done with the Farmington police officer his wife suspicious death was assigned to another department the New Mexico state police.
Investigators couldn't find any usable fingerprints on the shop.
And they removed the back wall containing the shot gun pellets for later analysis.
Investigators found a domestic violence complaint form.
Just the day before her death Monica had gone into police headquarters to have photographs taken of injury she said inflicted during upbeat.
She had a bruise on her cheek she had a bruise on her thigh and a couple of other places on her legs she was gonna file these battery charges that was going to cost him his job.
When police photographed Monica's injuries they violated standard procedure.
A witness said a male officer photograph Monica's injuries alone in his office with the blinds closed.
They would have a woman officer coming to take the photos and he didn't do that and she didn't have anybody in the room with them it's just him and Monica.
So there alone it took about ten minutes to do these photos the kind of questions on what happened in that room during that ten minutes.
Monica'S autopsy the path although just noted to abrasions near the entrance wound identical to those call shot gun.
A plastic Cup with four equally spaced holes the pallets together in the shower.
When fired the shot cop opens like a flower with four petals.
It will catch air and this will open the petals you'll see a shot cups opening and being spread out in the form of a cross road into the path of the bullet.
Since the shop opened before entering Monica's body this meant that the muscle was one to three feet away from Monica's body.
From muscle to trigger the gun was twenty nine inches long.
If the muscle was twelve to twenty four inches away from her abdomen Monica's arms would have to be almost twice as long to pull the trigger.
Vehemently denied killing his wife and offered to take a lie detector test.
Based on the forensic evidence he was arrested and charged with murder.
Police officers take an oath to protect and serve the public comments very disheartening please also engages in this kind of conduct.
Since he was a police officer he was separated from the rest of the prison population.
I was locked up twenty three and a half hours a day seven days a week.
Paste in X. in the paint on the floor.
Police department turned against him.
Once he gets charged once he's out of the group.
then I think they they pull ranks and stay together.
All the family friend Victor Titus to defend.
Ironically Titus had been a pallbearer and Monica's funeral and he couldn't understand why the family asked him.
They'Re very very family oriented and they would pick folks solely within the family and it wasn't just me but the other folks that were in the is as pallbearers as well let me know that those are hand chosen by Monica some.
And it just didn't feel right.
Monica have chosen her pallbearers if she was dead.
I just suspected Monica had left a suicide note and that it had been withheld from the defense.
At a pre trial hearing tightest demanded to know whether a suicide note existed.
Mr Sanchez among his father was in the courtroom in judging rich ask him directly he stood up and said yes I have something at home in my file cabinet.
Monica had given the note to a family member almost a month before her death.
It named Paul Ferris for her funeral and designated who should get her belongings when she died.
I now realize life isn't fair most of the time it seems very cruel.
Please tell the girls I love them very much I know they will greens.
I'M really sorry about this I just don't have any more strength or power to go on.
Prosecutors said the no didn't say anything about suicide it was Monica's last will and testament.
Prosecutors refused to drop the case based on the forensic evidence.
It would be left to a jury to decide.
Whether Monica don's death was a suicide.
More cold blooded murder.
In preparation for trial.
Don'S defense team hired Dave Pfeffer a private investigator with twenty years of police experience to examine the crime scene.
The evidence showed that the shot gun Alex went through Monica's body.
And ran them straight line indicated to us the line all three lines came directly to the fourth actually about a foot into the water better so that was very unscientific but it gave us a good general idea.
This contradicted the state's theory that Monica was standing when shot.
For a more detailed ballistic examination for contacted Nelson Welch the former chief firearms investigator for the New Mexico crime land.
In examining the autopsy photographs Welsh noticed a substance called.
In and around Monica's.
Fired a shotgun into ballistic gelatin covered with a cloth about two feet away which is where prosecutors say Paul was standing with the shotgun.
None of this was on the outside of the dress at the entry.
There was a large amount of graphics on the inside of the dress both on the front and on the back.
Intermingled with the blood and so almost all of the graphics that I could find enter the wound there was not outside.
The absence of graphics on the outside of Monica's dress well the gun was pressed against Monica's abdomen and was two feet away when fired.
A career army surgeon who had been the military's expert on gunshot wounds also examined the autopsy photographs.
Prosecution experts identified two shot Petaling.
Russians on Monica skin proving they say that the gun was two feet away.
Fackler says if the gun was two feet away.
Four petals would have been visible each ninety degrees from one another.
But this is an old twenty or more degrees off from where we have to be if it were shot hello and besides it doesn't look like a shot pal market because there's a little mark that most certainly has the front sight.
And so they just misinterpreted that.
Paul Dunne's defense experts were convinced that the gun was against Monica stomach when it went off.
But regardless of the government's position they would still need to prove that Paul Dunne did not pull the trigger.
Monica don's family insisted that their son in law Paul be held in prison without bail until the murder trial.
He didn't see his daughters and he was fired from the police force they broke they broke a map once a solitary confinement break anybody.
He decided that if he were convicted he would kill himself rather than do hard time.
He did keep part of a plastic razor he got rid of the plastic part of the razor and just kept you know the little tiny razor and he just decided you know he was not going to go to prison because what no inmates due to cops in prison.
At the trial prosecutors presented their theory that Paul shot Monica from two feet away.
While both were standing.
The defense presented a very different version of events.
In the court room they recreated bonkers bedroom using the actual bed and wall.
Snelson Welch showed the jury but the path of the shot gun pellets were inconsistent with the prosecution's theory.
Where it came from.
From the sheet rock the angle is downward.
And slightly towards the bed.
Through the sheet rock to the exit wound in Monica's back to the entrance wound to the muscles.
The lines converge much lower than prosecutors say.
The only way to get all these lined up is in the position of which we have it now which meant that Monaco was sitting on the bed with the part of the shot gun resting on the bed when it went off which was consistent with polls original statement to police.
Using a model the same size as Monica the defense showed that Monica could easily arrange the trigger by leaning the evidence showed that the gun was upside down and pointed up toward.
Making it virtually impossible for.
Hold the trigger it had been down at the foot of the bed.
It had been had to be down low in order to reach the trigger because it's way down on the bed and Monica would have had to allow that gun to be pointed at her stomach area contact.
All this was going on.
I made a comment to her if I was wrong in this case I would never work another farms case in my life they overlook all the evidence that absolutely contradicted the distance of fire being anything but a contact.
First wife and girlfriend both testified in court that he had never been physically abuse.
The jury had to decide between two competing theories.
Whether Monica killed herself.
The jury reached a verdict within minutes.
They all indicated a lenient.
Took an initial vote they all agreed it was a not guilty and everybody went to the bathroom colder here in basically kill time because they're afraid that the judges for me madam if they didn't take a little time.
Assocation has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and in this case it was the defense who proved innocence.
Not just beyond a reasonable doubt.
It'S not nice.
Still doesn't smell good.
Hold on didn't return to his job on the police force and he now works as a foreman for an oil company.
He says this case changed many of his long held beliefs.
As a cop he used to believe everyone in prison was guilty and although he denied ever hitting his wife.
He concedes his infidelity brought some of these problems on himself you don't go to jail for sing into Latin church.
Of the person I was then.
That I know the difference no.
It'S the mentality police officers assumed by the nature of the beast.
Did Monica commit suicide.
Many believe she simply couldn't stand losing call to another woman despite evidence she had been unfaithful herself.
Medical records show Monica had an abortion during her marriage long after Paul had a vasectomy.
Just how Monica got the bruises remains unknown.
And the letter she left behind raises more questions.
Recess on me will show she writes about a month before her death.
How do you know a month before you die that you're gonna have bruises on your body.
Statements like that just make it look like not only did she plan to kill herself but she planned to set him up.
Misinterpretation of the crime scene.
The prison for life.
But a more complete forensic examination ultimately set him free.
Scared to death because their Big Brother my pockets were tapped in my.
They were crying they want to put me in prison for the rest of my life.
Knowing that I didn't do it.
Make it easier for me to sit through the trial.
I'M scared to death.
The most difficult thing.
For people to do this to say I made a mistake.
And I just never I don't know that they will do it today.
The jury sure found out they made a mistake.
