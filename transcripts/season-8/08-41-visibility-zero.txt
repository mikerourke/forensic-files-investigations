In nineteen ninety three the Amtrak railroad experienced the deadliest train crash in United States history.
Forty seven passengers and crew were killed a hundred and three more were injured.
The clues to this mystery were attached and twisted steel and buried in the mud of an Alabama by waiting for investigators to find them.
Amtrak'S sunset limited is the country's only remaining trans continental train sunset limited has an interesting history kind of and dates back to the romantic time of train travel when it was very elegant posh to travel by train.
On September twentieth nineteen ninety three Justin and her husband Larry boarded the sunset limited in Deming New Mexico headed for Florida.
And I could sit there and look and talk to other people but the best part is going to the dining car we went the dining car three times a day and you just try it back over and they were really nice to you.
After dinner Trudy M. Lowry returned to their seats to wrest.
The train stopped briefly in New Orleans to fix a broken air conditioner.
By two thirty AM it was running about thirty three minutes behind schedule.
It stopped in mobile Alabama where the engineer waited until the freight train cleared the bridge up ahead.
then the sunset limited started on the last leg of the trip seven hundred fifty miles to Miami.
The train throttled up to a cruising speed of seventy two miles an hour but visibility was hindered by fog.
Shortly before three AM the sunset limited approach the bio cannot bridge.
In a matter of seconds the trains three engines and next four cars plummeted into the water.
The engine's fuel tanks ruptured igniting the diesel fuel then the people start yelling we got to get out of here because this is going to explode.
The tugboat motel I was the first to report the accident.
It was a hell on earth kind of environment it was just a horrific horrific sight.
Trudy grabbed her husband Larry and swam for shore the fire just was getting bigger you see nothing I heard people say and we're gonna die we're going to die and I heard the lord's prayer the mobile headed towards the flames through the dense fog to investigate I didn't know where the pope came from we had no idea all we know is that the spotlight on us and of course we could see that it was you could hear it.
The crew pulled seventeen passengers from the water.
Others were less fortunate the parents of a little girl she was ten years old and handicapped they pushed her to the arms of a rescuer through a window on their car and they did make it out.
Of the two hundred twenty passengers and crew on board forty seven people were dead or unaccounted for.
The FBI immediately flew to the crash site to investigate the possibility of terrorism.
The Coast Guard and the national transportation safety board also sent investigators.
The locomotive was found buried in the mud at about a forty five degree angle and three quarters of it you could not see it just buried itself into the marsh.
Third was on the opposite side of the bridge for derailed cars were nearby.
As a local salvage crew began the grim task of pulling the dead from the bio investigators wanted to know what caused the deadliest accident in Amtrak history.
In the early hours of September twenty second nineteen ninety three Amtrak's sunset limited plummeted off the bio cannot bridge in Alabama killing forty two passengers and five crew members.
Ten minutes before the sunset limited derailed freight train crossed the bridge in the opposite direction without incident.
So what happened in those ten minutes.
Divers recovered the train's event recorder from the bio which is like an airline's flight data recorder.
The tape revealed the train was traveling at seventy two miles per hour and there was no break application.
Whatever caused the crash the engineer never saw it.
Investigators also discovered the signals on the tracks were green.
The signals are controlled by a current that goes through the rail and if the rail breaks the signal will immediately turn red so the signal didn't turn.
The bridge was originally built in three sections the southern section was a one hundred sixty five foot steel truss bridge the center section a single one hundred forty foot steel girder was originally designed to pivot so river traffic could pass through the northern section was simply one hundred ninety two feet of track laid on top of the wooden trestles.
The center section was totally destroyed.
Despite its design the swing feature of the bridge was never use and investigators discovered it wasn't connected properly.
Since they never did use it as a swing bridge they never did put in the same amount of tie downs at the ends of the bridge to hold it in place.
Divers also examined the wooden pilings that supported the bridge.
We wanted to determine if the piles had undergone any kind of deterioration such as damage from wood destroying organisms like us soft rot or brown rot decay.
Under a powerful microscope scientists examined the cell walls of the samples they look for triangular shaped micro organisms like these which would indicate brought since we didn't find the present then we're fairly comfortable that there was no appreciable deterioration of the piles contributing to the collapse.
All that remained were three concrete piers.
When investigators looked more closely they discovered that the steel plates used to connect the bridge to the concrete were displaced forty eight inches out of alignment.
Carly also examined the bolts that attach the metal plates to the concrete those attachments were poorly maintained in several cases the holes that were supposed to have balls through them didn't have anything recognizable in them when we took the material out there was in those holes we found that it was Russ.
When the sunset limited was pulled out of the water of bio cannot with sections of the bridge it was evident that something terrible had happened.
Investigators found that one of its sides a metal girder had been sheared off as if struck on the hand by a powerful force.
Carly measured the spacing of the girders rivets and compared them to scratches along the side of the train's engine.
The rivets made lines down the side of the engine and you could match the lines made by those ribbons with the bridge and confirm that that was what destroyed the girder of the bridge.
But how did the train hit the side of the bridge.
While structural engineers examined all the evidence Coast Guard investigators began interviewing eyewitnesses.
What they were about to learn would provide a surprising lead to the investigation.
Investigators had many questions but few answers to what caused the crash of Amtrak sunset limited.
Coast Guard investigators also interviewed the man and women who helped in the rescue my first stop was actually to interview the crew of the tugboat mobility.
And that was because they were the reporting party of the accident.
On the night of the crash.
The mobile it was making a routine run up the mobile river pushing a load of coal and pick up.
The villa was pushing six barges so the pilot was four hundred feet away from the front of the barges.
Investigators learned that the pilot willing to call the coastguard three hours before the train crash to report the fog on the mobile river.
About a half hour before the accident Jim said he steered his six barges around the band in the mobile river and saw what appeared to be another tugboat on his radar he said he steered towards it hoping to tie on to it until visibility improves.
But before that could happen with the Oldham said his tug boat ran aground.
At this point captain Andrew Stabler took over command of the Marbella and called the Coast Guard asking for help.
Around two fifty AM the motherless crew heard a crash.
Then saw a fire through the fog.
What I'm looking at all have it out there.
What is the most fellow was on the mobile river how were they able to see an accident on the bio cannot six miles away.
But that was a mistake the accident was on the bridge going across the bio cannot hold water way that was closed to commercial boat traffic by you cannot is a subsidiary of the mobile river and in the very dense fog the operator of the tug mistakenly turned down into bite you cannot thinking it was a bit in the river a couple miles further up river than worry really was.
How could this happen.
Investigators discovered that the mobile I had no maps on board or even a compass.
The mobile it was equipped with radar which wasn't required at the time but the pilot Willie Odom wasn't trained to use it the conclusion we did not know anything about the radar could turn around if you look at the picture of it with you know I think about the function of the red raider.
When investigators heard Oldham story they went back to the bridge to examine what now seems like a key piece of evidence.
The railroad bridge had a concrete pier that was holding up the bridge structure and there was very fresh damage to the concrete of that bridge pier something had hit the point of the pier.
Was it one of the mall Phyllis barges had the mobility because the sunset limited to derail when we found the the left hand barge there was a similar.
Mark of spray paint and an indentation in the middle in fact it kinda looked T. shape which would indicate to the barge hit the top or flat portion as well as the age of it and I kind of gave it a T. shaped more.
The other barges revealed more surprising lose.
The centre barge also had damage they were vertical scrapes and and indentation.
When we pull the girder out of the water we did a.
Visual inspection and we noticed that some of the vertical steel members colts defenders who were on the side of the order had been banned flapped against the court.
Investigators measured the distance between the staff nurse and compared them to the vertical marks on the barge.
They were a perfect match.
Now they had solid evidence to prove what caused the fatal crash of the sunset limited.
Authorities knew that the tugboat mall that what was in the vicinity of the bio cannot bridge shortly before the train crash and not on the mobile river as the pipe that talked.
Investigators discovered concrete chips on the mobilised front left barge.
The chips along with samples from the bridge's pier was sent to the FBI for analysis each mix of concrete is unique it has a specific amount of rocks sand cement and water.
The investigators cut the concrete samples into razor thin slices then study done under a transmitter light microscope.
The microscope shines polarized light through the samples revealing the specific optical properties of the rocks sand and cement the FBI after they examined the samples they found on the barge determined that the concrete on the barge was the same as that found in the pier at the south end of based on all the evidence the national transportation safety board concluded that Willie Odin had gotten lost in the heavy fog as he piloted the mall fell out the mobile river.
He mistakenly veered left on to the bio cannot instead of continuing on the mobile river.
Then mistook the radar image of the bridge for another toll barge.
As he tried to maneuver towards it his front left barge struck the concrete south pier the other two barges struck the bridge itself knocking the bridge and the train tracks forty eight inches out of alignment.
When Odum struck the bridge he didn't know what in part because he couldn't see the bridge through the fog since it was on the lighted.
Odum mistakenly believed he had run aground.
Inexplicably the collision bend the track in an S. shape but didn't break it which explains why the electrical current running through the tracks didn't break either.
At the track and seven sure that signal would have gone off down the line and we'll put a warning in the field that something was wrong at the track ever by a counter.
Postcard records show the mobilised drug the bridge only eight minutes before the sunset limited arrived as the engineer headed towards the bridge he saw a green light telling him the track ahead was all clear as the train approached I believe that the engine derailed just as it was getting to the portion of the bridge that had been moved sideways and it hit that portion of the bridge dragging the entire bridge along with the engines and destroying it it's a big piece of steel out of the bridge and the train struck at seventy two miles an hour and then from that you could tell that it just tore the hell out of it.
As the track collapsed the lead engine and the next four cars flew into the water.
Some of the passenger car stopped on the bridge or the fidelity count might have been higher.
Tragically the train was running about a half hour late due to the stop to repair the air conditioning.
At the train ban on time it would have crossed the bridge before the mall villa ran into it.
I think this investigation just confirm for me a couple of of long standing philosophies that I've had one is that every accident is a kind of a chain reaction there's five or six links in the chain that all have to happen in order for an accident to happen.
They never did put in the same amount of tie downs at the ends of the bridge to hold it in place therefore it wasn't as resistant to a barge hitting it as it would have been if they had tied it down at the end spider.
People call us excellence and that was clearly the case here.
A year after the accident survivors gathered to remember those who lost their lives.
By then new regulations were in place to prevent similar accidents.
Tugboats are now required to have radar on.
And all operators are required to have formal training and how to use it.
The boats are also required to have a compass on board as well as the necessary maps and revert charts.
If the Mozilla had only had a compass on board this accident might never have happened.
Has there been a compass Willie Odom might have realized he was making a left turn and not going down the wrong channeled into by you cannot.
There is also a requirement for all bridges to have lighting even those on waterways closed to commercial traffic.
Willie Odom was cleared of any criminal charges.
But he never again to talk.
I think my main interest in.
All of the jobs I get into is to determine what went wrong.
So that we can learn from.
Bad things have happened in the past and do better in the future.
I can't prove that what's happened but if I learned lessons from that and then make changes in rules regulations and procedures I've done a lot to prevent that next one from happening.
