A man died in his home after a long history of heart disease it was assumed that this was the cause of his death.
A few weeks after the funeral rumors surfaced that the death was no accident.
When the body was exhumed scientists needed to know whether the debt could tell tale.
On a January night in nineteen ninety oh woman call for an ambulance saying her boyfriend was unconscious and barely breathing.
Emergency personnel were at the home in Westport Massachusetts within minutes.
We arrived on the scene went into the house we found a male.
The man's girlfriend said he had a long history of heart trouble.
As soon as I took his role hi I saw that he had a scar from a past cardiac surgery which indicated that he had a bypass surgery at some point in time and stuff we begin CPR.
But the CPR brought no response.
Sixty one year old Richard Alfredo was pronounced dead an hour later at a nearby hospital.
Because of his heart disease the local medical examiner decided not to perform an autopsy.
Mr Alfredo had a long history of severe heart disease which necessitated a surgical correction of his blocked coronary arteries in the heart.
Coronary bypass procedure so at the time of his death he had every reason to.
From his heart disease.
Richard Alfredo was buried four days after his death.
All of his assets worth about twenty five thousand dollars went to his estranged wife and children.
Alfredo'S girlfriend thirty nine year old Christina Martin continued to live in the house the couple shared along with her two children from a previous marriage.
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until Westport police officer Michael sales started hearing rumors.
We had a room is that Mr Alfredo's death was due to poisoning and this is just facts that we couldn't prove at that time was just information and as a police department we had the obligation start looking into this.
The rumors emanated from some students at a nearby high schools.
Richard Alfredo's girlfriend Christina Martin had a fourteen year old daughter Tisha who attended Westport high school.
T. shirt allegedly told school friends and Alfredo what made sexual advances towards her on numerous occasions.
And she admitted that she and her mother were angry about it.
The teenagers were telling as miss mine was trying to locate anything that would take the life of Mr Alfredo.
Investigators now wondered whether they made a mistake burying the body without an autopsy.
Four weeks after Richard Alfredo stats rumors circulated that his death was no accident.
The daughter of Alfredo's girlfriend Tisha allegedly told friends that Alfredo had made sexual advances towards her.
And she also said that her mother put the drug LSD and Alfredo's gelatin dessert internet for to kill him.
They made the Jello they waited two separate dishes they eat Jello but his dish was kept to the side at that time they spent on the job and then they went out of the house and they came back and it was basically dead at that time they called rescue and he was transported to Saint Luke's hospital was pronounced dead.
LSD is a powerful hallucinogen known on the street as acid.
A dose or hit usually comes in tablets or in liquid soaked into paper.
A single drop can cause hallucinations for six to ten hours we've been told by people that have taken Ellis.
You seen all kinds of different things animals running across the room at you things crawling up the wall things crawling on you so you know it would have put him in a position where he had no idea what was going on.
And the listing can also cause a rapid increase in heart rate.
Local drug dealer admitted selling thirty doses of LSD to a small group which included Alfredo's girlfriend Christina and her daughter Tisha.
They identified miss one is sitting in the vehicle and they brought drugs to her and they left the area at that time.
During police questioning Christina denied buying LSD or giving Richard Alfredo any harmful substances.
Miss mine was trying to locate anything that would.
Take the life of Mr Alfredo the metal with a with a some type of a medication or pills or.
She even tried to get some of the teenagers to if you would they would take him out with a weapon.
she was gonna provide the gun for them which was just offering those guns.
To see if LST had caused Alfredo's death the medical examiner his body six weeks after the funerals.
In a living person LST leaves the body within thirty six hours of use but in a dead person the drug can stay indefinitely although the embalming process can complicate matters.
Is such that all the blood in the body is removed and replaced with embalming fluid a conservative so that.
Any attempt at trying to find poisons is hampered because there is no blood left in the body.
They found some other tissue samples to test.
There was some intestinal contents dilution stomach contents.
The samples were sent to two different labs for testing the state crime lab and another private laboratory.
Dr Louis Amoruso perform the testing at the private land and used what is called a radio immuno essay task or are I a.
It'S similar to the test used at sporting events to screen athletes for the presence of performance enhancing drugs.
If LSD were present in Alfredo's body he would have formed anti bodies to fight.
Both the private land and the police lab found two drugs present in Alfredo system one was diphenhydramine.
Common over the counter cold medication.
The more important compound as far as we're concerned was LSD because there are no prescriptions frosty and that would indicate something that would not be found except under realistic conditions.
Cause a fatal heart attack.
Richard Alfredo's death was no longer considered an accident it was now.
A heart attack brought on by acute LSD intoxication.
When police went to arrest Christina Martin and her daughter Tisha they found that they had fled the country.
This one leaving town led us to believe that she definitely had some involvement in his death that's what made us look even more closely to her even though we were on that track anyway.
Telephone records indicated they fled to Montreal where they were apprehended.
Christina Martin was charged with first degree murder no charges were filed against her daughter Tisha.
Prosecutors presented the toxicological evidence of LSD and Richard Alfredo system and a drug dealer testified that Christina was present when he sold LSD to teaches high school friends.
Christina Martin was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.
And that's where the case.
For seven long years.
That is until it came up for a routine appeals were Christina's lawyer found something in the case file he wasn't supposed to see.
Christina Martin had served seven years in prison for the murder of her boyfriend Richard Alfredo before her case came up for a routine appeals.
Christina'S new lawyer was a public defender Kevin Mahoney.
His first task was to go to the courthouse to pick up the case file.
While I was standing at the counter waiting for the evidence to be brought to me by the Clark I struck up a conversation the gentleman next to me one of being an assistant DA.
The assistant DA told Mahoney to look very closely at Richard Alfredo's official cause of death well I was stunned that a prosecutor would make such an admission to make I definitely took it as a red flag this is something I should follow through with.
The first murder case Mahoney ever handled.
And he read every page of transcript of Christina's first trial paying particular attention to anything related to how Richard Alfredo had died.
The transcripts so fascinating I couldn't put it down it was like a great novel at first blush it seems that the evidence was overwhelming because these toxicologists chemists to getting in there the testifying that this massive amounts of out of state Jeez is it didn't sound good.
He came across this document.
Richard Alfredo's death certificate stating the cause of death as cute LSD intoxication.
Mahoney made a telephone call to doctor David Benjamin highly respected clinical pharmacologist.
There had never been a case reported a person had died from the direct effects of LSD so right away that allegation was inconsistent with the whole body of scientific information dating back to the mid sixties that's a thirty year period of time.
Dr Benjamin noticed another potential discrepancy.
B. R. I. A. test was designed to work only on fresh urine samples which the medical examiner didn't have after the body was autopsy.
The labs tested tissue samples and degraded block all of which had been embalmed.
I called the manufacture and I asked do you have any experience with using this task in samples other than fresh urine in particular forensic samples obtained from the exam bodies or from dead people and they said absolutely not.
And even if the urine tests positive for LSD the R. I. A. test is only for screening.
Any positive results must then be retested to confirm the results.
On the R. I. A. test kit outer box the manufacturer makes this clear.
It states that all our I a results are preliminary and that is specific alternative must be used to get a confirmed analytical results.
Even the scientists who conducted the original R. I. a test for the prosecution agreed with that assessment.
In order to save with one or percent certainty that it was L. S. T. that was present in the body I would have to go to a confirmatory test the gold standard all the tests that is considered to be the most dependable is the one that's called gas chromatography mass spectrometry.
For whatever reason.
Christina Martin's first lawyer never questioned the test results.
The defense attorney at the trial.
This performance was so bad that the judge called him up to side bar and asked to.
You'Re not doing very much examination of these witnesses this is that is that intentional is that deliberate.
And the attorney tried to reassure the judge and tell them don't worry it'll all come out my defense case but it never did.
If the scientific tests were only preliminary why wasn't a confirmatory test ever performed.
Kevin Mahoney found the answer to that question in the evidence files information prosecutors never presented at the first trial.
Information prosecutors thought would remain secret.
When Kevin Mahoney examined the case file from Christina Martin's first trial he found an important piece of evidence.
It was evidence that prosecutors never presented at the first trial.
Prosecutors had commissioned a confirmatory test on Alfredo's tissue samples using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer it's a test that can identify every substance in the sample.
That test detected no LSD in any of the samples.
Even though they tested and retested and retested that would desperate to confirm the what they've learned from the radio in the west a test but they they weren't able to do that.
Only discovered this exculpatory forensic evidence was not given to Christina Martin's defense attorney before the trial.
This violated the legal provision known as the Brady doctrine.
The Brady doctrine says that the prosecution has a duty to turn over all exculpatory evidence to the defense without even being asked for.
In this case the prosecutor but had the ball with the exculpatory evidence the gas chromatography mass spectrometry evidence should have been disclosed to defense attorney it never was.
This may explain why an assistant DA told Mahoney to look carefully at the official cause of Richard Alfredo staff.
And this new forensic evidence was put before an appeals court judge who was unusually qualified for this particular case.
Ninety nine out of a hundred judges eyes would just glazed over when they started hearing cheesy mass back and all this other stuff.
The judge in this case judge cordoned off for.
Was a chemistry major in college.
How lucky we.
In his decision.
Judge door first sighted defects in the scientific evidence and the prosecution's failure to disclose critical exculpatory evidence as grounds for a new trial.
But prosecutors decided not to retry the case.
Christina Martin agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a sentence of time served in other words Christina Martin was a free one.
Moments after leaving the courtroom Christina Martin told the press that despite the plea bargain she had nothing to do with their boyfriends.
I pleaded guilty because of the plea bargain and the chance that I might go back to jail I didn't want that I would have liked to have had this woman found not guilty but this is not the first person in Massachusetts to say they did something in order to get out of being prosecuted when you feed a being held to the fire you gonna do things you really don't want to do.
She may have had a guilty conscience about some of the things that she was thinking about doing and maybe some of the things that she had done plus there's also the possibility with her daughter involved that our daughter might have done some things to this gentleman without her knowledge.
But while science rules out LSD it reveals another possibility.
When Alfredo's body was exhumed the medical examiner found ground water in the casket the water mixed with the embalming fluid may have contaminated the tissue samples.
Basically LSD has a chemical structure and that chemical structure is not unique to LSD there are many substances in the body and in nature in general that possess similar chemical structures two of them that we would find in the body would be the amino acid tryptophan and the neuro transmitter serotonin there are also get derivatives that are in there the grass and the ground and then fungi and fungal material that could been washed into the coffin when all of the water seeped into the coffin.
And the preliminary drug test was supposed to be used on fresh urine samples not tissue samples.
Dr Benjamin also believes it may have been cold medicine diphenhydramine Alfredo was taking for his cold that caused his death since it can increase one's heart rate.
I will tell you what reasonable doubt arose for me that was first of all nobody dies from LSD they commit suicide but they don't have direct toxic effects that lead to death the original prosecutor in this case refused all requests for an interview.
Officially a prosecutor still maintain the Christina Martin killed Richard Alfredo defense experts say LSD has never killed anyone.
Richard Alfredo's tombstone is not engraved with the date of his death.
A metaphor for the uncertainty that still exists in this case bad science and bad ethics resulted in miss Martin being sent to a prison cell.
Was good ethics and good science the Colorado the prison cell so bad science put her in good science got around.
