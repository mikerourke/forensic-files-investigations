Just weeks before testifying at a criminal trial one of the key witnesses.
For fifteen years there were many suspicions but the little proof ironically advances in the very research the victim had been working on hello nailed her killer.
When you ask friends and colleagues about Helena green would you hear words like brilliant Y. honest and hard worker.
Earned a PhD in microbiology and was an executive in the biotech industry.
She not only was an excellent scientist but she had marketing skills and those two things often are not concurrent.
Specially looking at technology.
But she also knew the power that technology by itself doesn't market a product.
Basically it's the human need there's a human need this product.
And her husband Roger landscape designer lived in after ten.
Suburb outside San Francisco.
Our story begins on a Saturday night in April of nineteen eighty four when Roger was out of town on a business trip.
In the middle of the night.
A man suddenly appeared in Helen's bedroom had threatened to kill.
Dr Greenwood described her assailant is being fairly tall slender athletic with a complexion perhaps of part half black or Hispanic person name all of Kentucky complexion.
She couldn't see his face because he had a hooded sweatshirt pulled up so that only his eyes showed.
The assailant entered the home through a kitchen window.
But it was helping his friend who found a key piece of evidence that police had overlooked.
Outside on the deck near the kitchen window was a teapot from hell in this kitchen fortunately the friend had the good sense not to touch it.
The teapot was taken into evidence.
Taken to the crime lab and finger prints were developed imagine the teapot there were three fingerprints in this position as though someone had picked up the teapot from the windows cell and placed it on the deck.
Helena told police she made tea before going to bed then placed a teapot on the window sill.
It appeared the assailant moved before crawling through the window.
Unfortunately the fingerprints didn't match any on file with the police department.
With no other leads the case went on song.
Until one year later.
A man was arrested while exposing himself to a twelve year old girl outside an apartment in Belmont California.
That suspect was David Paul Freddie Yanni.
The suspect David pull free Diani was a forty two year old accountant with no prior arrests.
Since Freedia honey resembled the man Helena described police compared his fingerprints to those found on Helena's.
One of things I asked him was he denied even being involved initial sexual assault against Mrs Greenwood.
I remember asking him he never assaulted this woman he says no I never did any of that they then told them we have your fingerprints at that point according to detective should pull.
Freddy I took a deep breath let it out began trembling he could actually see his chest moving in and out and made a statement to the effect as I was really drunk when I did those things.
He then asked for a lawyer and refused to make any more statements.
At the preliminary hearing we're both Helena and Freddie Yanni were present she was asked if she could identify them and she couldn't not positively.
And out of that arise is one of the great mysteries of this whole case.
The fingerprints on the teapot we're all the prosecution.
So the case headed to trial.
Sadly Helena Greenwood didn't live long enough to testify in court.
While her sexual assault case was pending in the green wood and her husband Roger moved from San Francisco to San Diego.
She took a new job with Jan pro of biomedical research firm that was looking for ways to diagnose disease through DNA.
It would be more specific one more accurate.
It would also allow the testing to be more rapid cutting down test from that would take sometimes weeks just two days or things that would take days just down two minutes.
One morning before work Helen was at home on the phone making last minute preparations for an important company meeting.
Was very prompt she would always come in at nine o'clock.
But on this day.
She never arrived.
Over percent Morishima had a feeling that something was terribly wrong.
And again she was very precise on her arrival at Jan pro being at night Stacey if she had a meeting with some.
Co workers called Helena's husband at work.
He immediately drove home.
I found the front gate lock.
When he peered over the fence.
He saw his wife's body.
Roger was in total shock.
And the first call Jan pro we didn't call the police to call Jim crow that shows how disoriented he was.
To the house the police tapes were up they wouldn't let us through the gate but you knew that it.
Just from the top that was going on that Helena was assaulted.
The crime scene appeared to be staged it had the earmarks of a robbery but no money was missing from Helena's want.
First it was strewn about the preserved all of that for fingerprints or other evidence of which unfortunately there were there were none there was no physical evidence left.
Obviously he wore gloves I mean one safely consume that I guess.
And it was clear.
Helen of valiantly fought her attacker this woman put up a hellish fight obviously was evidenced by the fact.
At the autopsy the medical examiner discovered the T. Kiel hemorrhages in Helena's eyes an indication of strangulation.
There were no signs of sexual assault.
But under Helena's fingernails were tiny traces of what appeared to be blocked unfortunately the sample was too small for forensic analysis.
I mean what comes to mind when when there's a bizarre murder yeah the strangulation in broad daylight you think marital trouble you think crime you think drugs I mean hello never got within a thousand miles of any of those things and that's simply deepen the mystery.
Helena'S husband Roger was the first person police interview.
At the time because he was just.
They were accusing I mean he was a suspect in he was just saying this is this is this is why are they doing this to me whenever a woman is killed.
The prime suspect is generally the husband and statistically that bears out most women who are killed or killed by someone well known to them usually a romantic interest and the husband is often the the the perpetrator.
Roger said he left home at eight AM and was at work at the time of his wife's murder around nine AM.
Records indicated Helena had been on the telephone until nine AM about the time a neighbor heard a commotion.
One man who lives next door said about nine o'clock when he was shaving he thought he heard human you know an abrupt human cry but who knows.
When police confirmed Roger was at work forty minutes away at that time he was eliminated as a suspect.
Hello this merger also meant that she would never testify at the sexual assault trial back in San Francisco.
Got a call from Roger Franklin who was Dr green was husband Roger told me that his wife had been murdered in San Diego the San Diego area where they had moved after the sexual assault.
I was a sickening moment because he also told me that.
Purse was found near her body her car keys were there her credit cards were there it didn't appear that there been a robbery.
David Paul three D. on the man accused of having a sexual assault had been out on bail at the time of Helen this merger but insisted he was five hundred miles away in San Francisco.
Investigators were naturally suspicious.
He was the only person who conceivably had a motive for doing this.
The prosecutor refused to drop the sexual assault charges against.
But everyone wondered whether the prosecutor would ever get a conviction now that his witness was.
Just three weeks before she was scheduled to testify in her sexual assault trial.
Hello the green wood was murdered in her front yard.
Prosecutors had his fingerprints on Helena's T..
And they also found serological evidence.
We also presented evidence that the semen on the pillowcase in Helena Greenwood's bedroom first that it was semen.
Second that it was from a type individuals who assists the creator and that A. T. G. M. type phosphocholine co mutase of one plus all matched Freddie Yannis HBO type.
D. N. A. testing in nineteen eighty five was still in its infancy.
At the last minute when faced with the fingerprint and serological evidence free Diani pleaded no contest to the assault and was sentenced to five years in prison.
The treaty on he said he was innocent of her murder.
They knew who killed hell on the green they knew it was David ball Freddie Yanni but they couldn't prove it.
Eventually coming to Greenwood's merger was relegated to San Diego county's cold case files and forgot.
Over the next several years Helen's parents died her husband Roger develop cancer and he too passed away.
And who is there to mourn.
Very few and growing fewer.
And Jan pro what about the work Helena had been pursuing before her death looking for ways to use new DNA technology for quicker faster medical diagnoses.
David treaty on the server only three years of his five year sentence and was released he returned to his accounting practice.
This is a very egotistical self centered.
Obviously sociopathic person Hey I just got away with murder yeah and his life went on and he prospered.
And that's where the case stood for another ten years.
Until investigators in San Diego's cold case unit decided to take a second look at Helena green woods emerged.
And deep and Helen this file was a piece of information that immediately caught investigators attention.
Seven days before Helen this murder David Paul free Diani was involved in a minor traffic accident in southern California not far from Helen is home.
The defendant had no business being in southern California we knew he knew she lives down here although we didn't know how he had that information.
But it just seemed a little bit strange that is awaiting trial he lives in San Francisco and he takes a trip down to southern California.
As detectives look through the evidence they noted it was a tiny speck of blood under Helen his fingernail at the time far too small for DNA testing.
I had a rain check science advanced to the point that it could identify a speck of blood almost too small to see.
For thirteen years the merger of biotech research scientist Helena Greenwood went unsolved.
The medical examiner found what looked to be blocked under one of her fingernails.
At the time it was far too small for DNA analysis.
By nineteen ninety eight however work the Gen probe and scientists like calendar green would have been working on led to new developments in DNA testing.
One of the most important was polymerized chain reaction or PCR which enabled scientists to copy my new DNA samples until they were large enough to test.
Polymerase chain reaction allows you to make a geometrically increasing number of copies for you start with the one after one round of P. C. are you end up with two and then four and then H. and so on the big advantage of PCR for forensic work is that it is so sensitive you're very small amount of DNA can yield a very large amount of information it's unfortunate thing that they didn't try to tested at the time because you test of biological material it is it's destroyed and had they at the time of Helena's autopsy tested that material they would have found nothing in the material would have been destroyed.
When the biological material from Helena stinger nails was tested using PCR scientists made an important finding.
On some of the fingernail clippings they found the only DNA that was consistent with Dr green wants in on one of the clippings they found.
The DNA that was essentially.
And that's when I got very interested because of course the possibility isn't that's the perpetrator's DNA.
And investigators found even more evidence on Helen is closing.
On her nylon stockings were grab marks so they decided to test that area from microscopic traces of blood.
And found some.
And here are the numbers.
The odds that the DNA under Helen this fingernail and stockings with someone other than David three D. on these was one in twenty three billion.
He could hardly believe it when police arrested him.
Mr Freddie Yanni came out of his house and began walking to his car and that's when we approached him and placed him under arrest his reaction was all the color just fresh from his face he turned white I think he knew at that point that he was gonna be looking over shoulder anymore was over.
Great satisfaction for us.
All three D. on a was charged with first degree murder.
One of the tragedies of many tragedies in this case is that.
Roger never lived to hear that Freddie Yanni who he knew.
I had done the murder he never lived to hear that San Diego authorities were able to identify Mr Freddie Yanni as the murder.
Prosecutors believe three D. on the murdered Helena in the mistaken belief that her death and the sexual assault case against him he was a smart enough to understand that just because he killed Mrs Greenwood.
He drove five hundred miles from his home in San Francisco to Helena's home in San Diego the stock the couple and learn their schedules.
His first mistake was getting into a car accident a few days before the murder proof that he was in San Diego before the crime.
Free Deonte learned that Roger left for work every morning around eight AM about an hour before held.
Prosecutors believe three D. on the waited for Helena outside her front gate he was wearing gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints like he did when he assaulted Helena a year earlier.
When he heard Helen close the front door he made his nose.
Three D. ani probably believed the clubs would protect him and didn't realize he left crucial forensic evidence behind.
Ironically it was Helen who grabbed it.
I can only imagine what's going to help us mind at this man who assaulted her is off she coming to do harm to her maybe it's just a little too much to think but.
Check out this guy we know sh we know she did I almost wonder like Hey I'm gonna leave some evidence behind.
Show my killer was I may not survive this but by god I'm gonna leave something behind to tell you who killed me and I think this is what happened in this case.
The trial under cross examination free Diani admitted to the sexual assault but he did not confessed to her murder.
Regardless he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
We expect victims to testify and that's what Helen agreement did.
Testified against defendant at the preliminary examination and then the tractor down and the killer.
No conviction is justice for what happened to her.
Ironically the science that she was working on in fact help the way her killer.
