A young walked out of this department store got into a rental car and was never seen again.
The signature on the rental car agreement was a forgery.
French scientists hope that either the hand writing or the from the.
Solve the mystery.
Nestled in the hills sixty miles northwest of Los Angeles lies then Torre California.
May sixth nineteen ninety six started like most other days for thirty year old Cherie Dalley she dropped her two children off at school.
But on this morning she went shopping before work.
Sherri was expected home by noon.
She never returned.
Cherise van was found in the parking lot of a local store.
It was unlocked with their personal items from the store still inside at this point we're still trying to figure out where to go.
Thinking that she might be with a relative or there were there might be some I've gone off for some friends for some reason we don't we don't know.
Detectives asked the store employees if they had seen anything suspicious.
A security guard recalled seeing sherry in the store earlier that morning she stopped and spoke briefly with a friend of hers who was head of security at the department store at that time.
Then she went about her business and did some shopping.
Checked out she walked out of the the department store and walked over towards her.
The surveillance camera shows a cherry left the store at nine twenty two AM.
I mean sure is the backbone of the family and now she's missing they were gonna try to do the basic venture of river bottom friends and family passed out fliers throughout the community.
Television and radio reports asked citizens for information.
Many new Cherie Dalley and her husband Michael since they both grew up in the area he was the first real boyfriend she ever had she was just so much in love with him that she could see nothing else I mean the sun rose and sat in my.
Cherian by Kevin married for twelve years and had two small children Mike worked as a manager at the grocery store.
Background check revealed the couple had a history of marital problems we know that he represented to her that he wanted to make a call with the marriage.
But his actions did not.
Coincide with his expressed reason for going back to the home.
Why friends said Michael had a love for a woman he worked with it was a former model Diana Han.
He did not keep it a secret his co workers knew about it family members knew about it and of course sherry daily actually learned about it as well she.
The day after sherry's disappearance investigators decided to question Diana Han at her home she answered the door in a skimpy outfit obviously.
And behind her as Michael Dally.
Naturally police were suspicious.
I would expect a concern husband.
To be at his girlfriend's house.
Wells wife is gone it's disappeared.
Soon a witness came forward claiming to have seen Cherie Dalley in the parking lot and said she appeared to be in some distress.
Just a few days after thirty year old Cherie Dalley disappeared an eyewitness told police she saw sherry in the store parking lot and it looked as if she was being arrested.
She was seen by witnesses standing at her band or.
And the woman approached her.
Sure he turned around spoke with her briefly just to exchange some very briefly.
Whereupon sherry turned around the woman placed handcuffs on sherry.
Walked over to the car.
Put her into the back of the car as police officer would.
The person was described.
Female wearing a tan pants suit.
This didn't resemble Diana Han who was Michael Doughty's lover Han was a brunette and she didn't own a car like the get away vehicle.
Description was a teal colored car that to me wasn't a common car color to be seen on the road.
So my attitude was it's got to be a rental.
Detective bird and his partner visited all of the local car rental agencies in the area skip is asking the lady behind the counter did Michael dalli rent a car from you folks and so she gets on the computer and nothing comes up for Michael down and he asks well what about Diana on hand but he goes to the computer and low and behold she says Diana Han rent a car on the fifth may fifth.
May fifth was the date before sherry disappeared we looked at each other and it was like who.
Diana Han denied renting the car claiming the signature on the rental agreement wasn't hers Furthermore no one at the car agency could positively identify Han as the person who rented the car.
The rental car had recently been returned.
We looked in you could just look inside the back windows and you could see on the rear floorboard a brownish color in the carpeting.
Forensic scientists perform tests on those brownish stains in the backseat of fino Dalene test was positive it's a chemical reagent that turns red when it comes into contact with the hemoglobin content of blood.
It appeared as though this was an area in which blood had pooled or huddled an individual sitting in the passenger backseat had been leaning forward and bleeding producing blood running in dripping into this area on the floor.
Investigators venues luminol to look for blood that may have been clean from the car and truck what we were told by the crime lab is that when the looming all the inside that car let up like a candle.
I mean there was blood everywhere on the door panels up and then headliner everywhere.
With blood samples from sherry's parents forensic scientists concluded that the blood inside the rental car was added sherry Delhi.
I knew something seriously was wrong because I knew she would never leave our children.
I mean she would never ever have left children on her own free will.
And scientists found something else.
In the backseat of the car five long pieces of what looked like human hair.
When I examine them microscopically I found out they weren't cares at all.
An infrared spectrometer identified the molecular structure of the strand not as a hair.
Twenty five days after sherry tallies disappearance from the store parking lot search volunteers found some bones off of a remote role.
Just three miles from where she was abducted.
They called about five thirty this Saturday evening.
I want to tell you before it hits the six o'clock news because it's gonna hit the news that we have found the remains.
Sherri Delhi's dental records were already on hand for identification purposes the correlation between the dental X. rays I fell at the time.
Sufficient to tell them the investigators said even without me taking X. rays and.
And forensic scientists were also able to determine the cause of death.
Room six experts at the crime lab were able to map out the different stab wounds different terriers in sherry shirt indicating that there were multiple stab wounds more in fact than were located in the bones sherry suffered a devastating attack.
There was in the right chart here you go.
A piece of metal.
That was embedded in the bone that was removed by one of the forensics experts at our crime lab Jim Roberts Roberts analyzed the metal fragment using an electron microscope which produced a three dimensional image and the picture he could identify.
After some study on the microscopes we became convinced that it was part of the serrated knife blade actually the tip of one of the teeth of the serrations sherry's husband Michael was one of the two suspects in the murder he said he was at work at the time of her reduction.
Everything pointed to Diana and we knew Michael was at work so he has the alibi of not being the hatch a plan.
Michael'S mistress Diana Han was the other suspect.
The car used in cherry Delhi's adoption was rented by someone who signed Diana Han's name.
On tonight it was her signature and insisted someone else had rented the car and forged her name.
Jack Harris is a forensic document examiner who specializes in handwriting analysis so if anyone is going to forge your name you're going to make it look like the signature on the driver's license and get this sent a very.
The capital letters on the rental car agreement were noticeably different than Diana Hines known signature sample and the writing also had a different slant.
Question signature on the budget rental agreement I have a little letters and then it went straight out to the right.
Paris then compared the signature on the car rental agreement to signatures Diana Holland signed ten years earlier.
And in those signatures Harris found a surprise.
Diana Holland signatures of a decade earlier were strikingly similar to the signature on the rental car agreement sure enough every so often she went straight out to the right and didn't curl back.
I concluded that my best judgment she signed the rental agreement an initial.
Paris believes that in signing the rental car agreement on thought she was creating a forgery but she was unknowingly using her writing style that she had used years earlier.
And investigators found more forensic evidence a lady that worked in a wig store in Oxnard recognize Diana horn as a person who approaches to wake from her just shortly before sherry direction on had paid for the items with the check.
Detectives search times records and found other checks written shortly before sherry's disappearance.
Checks were interesting written in green ink.
Not too many people carry and cleaning pen in their purse.
Diana Han was arrested she was found in her purse and green ink pen.
Detectives sent the checks and the green pan to a forensic document examiner who specialized in think analysis.
First test of reform or non destructive in nature in their intended to evaluate the in formulations not the pan the information.
The most common technique in comparison is to use a video spectral comparator.
Infrared lighting can identify give two examples are the same or different.
The spectral comparator showed that the eighty down the checks was from the same batch as the pan in Diana Han's purse and Diana Hans checkbook revealed she had made some other unusual purchases.
Based upon those checks had been written to the detectives followed up went to another department store and didn't factor in the Diana Han had purchased an axe lighter fluid matches sunglasses various items that would have been used during the objection.
Diana Han was arrested and charged with cherry dollies merger.
Was Michael Dally involved.
Narcissistic egotistical sociopath total lack of conscience.
Despicable disgusting human being.
Witnesses told police they saw a blonde woman up doc Cherie Dalley from a department store parking.
The prime suspect Diana Han was a brunette in a search of her home investigators found evidence that Han was a master of disguise is.
When we executed that search warrant her room we found all kinds of photographs showing her in different get ups in weeks and makeup as she posed for a modeling agency we asked.
Mother if she could pick out her daughter in any of these photographs and their mother started shaking your head no that this wasn't her daughter and harnessed telephone records showed something curious.
Diana and Michael spoke by telephone numerous times immediately before and after the abduction.
Based on the telephone calls and the forensic evidence prosecutors say Diana Holland rented the car under her own name because rental agencies require a valid driver's license to conceal her identity on attempted to forge your own signature a forgery detected by the forensic experts.
Unfollowed Cherie Dalley to the department store parking lot.
On was wearing a blonde wig and sunglasses to mask her identity.
When sherry left the store on may have posed as a member of law enforcement because witnesses say sherry was handcuffed and placed into the backseat.
At some point sherry in evidently recognized Diana and knew her husband and his mistress we're going to kill her.
The forensic evidence shows the Diana killed Shari in the backseat of the rental car through her body down the deserted Rabin the murder weapons in the trunk and drove to Ventura marine.
There she changed out of her bloody clothes and called Michael from the pay phone to say the murder was done.
From there on drove to a car wash and attempted to clean the blood from the backseat and trunk but she was unsuccessful.
Luminol fino saline and DNA testing confirmed the charity Dolly was brutally attacked him on his rental car.
The five week fibrous confirmed the disguise.
Corrente canned writing and analysis also revealed that it was Han signature on cheques used to purchase the weak and the axe you have to be maniacal you have to be evil you have to have something inherently vicious inside of you to be able to do what she did to sherry telling them to leave those two young boys without their mother.
The telephone calls haunted place to Michael dell the before and after the murder was evidence of his complicity.
The nights we arrested Michael we did a search warrant on his home in on the bed where he and his wife had slept was a full length hello that you can get probably through some company where you can actually take somebody's photograph and have it actually.
Printed on this pillow will guess whose face was on the pillow.
And that pillow was there well sherry was still alive.
I still get hurt for the betrayal.
I think he betrayed us and he betrayed sherry.
And the worst possible way.
And and the fact that she loved him and he used that love.
Titled action find Michael Anthony gallium guilty.
Diana Shawn and Michael Donnelly were both convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Church life and upbringing tells me that I should be able to forgive him unfortunately god is gonna have to forgive me for the fact that I will never be able to offer the forgiveness to him.
Can you describe sherry and Diana's relationship.
That'S not my fault the two men women let me.
and I think it was any trip.
I think you know exactly what it was to.
One thing that I'll never forget about this case.
And this was the man that killed me.
And that's something that I'll always remember.
I'M saying and I'm sure it's something that he can't.
I don't see how we would have solved the case.
