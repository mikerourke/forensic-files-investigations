One time tourists in South Florida where a favorite target for criminals.
Hundreds of visitors were robbed some were assaulted and date were murdered.
It was an out of town journalists to made an unexpected journey tourist victim advocate.
In September of nineteen ninety three movie fell how Morocco Braun and his wife flew from Germany to Florida to spend their honeymoon they rented a car for the short trip to their hotel.
The two German tourists were less than five minutes from the airport just time enough to read safety precautions in a visitors guide when they became the newest victim.
The couple knew this wasn't an accident but a ploy robbers use to get drivers to stop their cars they call it the bump and rob but the rock a bronze did what they were supposed to do did not stop then the gunman pulled alongside and fired a single shot.
Thirty three year old who they feel helm was killed instantly his twenty seven year old bride Catherine was unharmed.
By the end of the year there were eight tourist murders in South Florida hundreds more were rock and many more seriously injured.
Tourists were easy targets.
You can't change people's behavior the lost tourists looking at street signs the holding up of maps the camera bags the luggage in the backseat.
You know it's not too hard to identify tourists especially around the airport.
And they have what criminals want cameras jewelry video.
Top computers and they usually carry plenty of cash.
Hello the loose covered these tourists crimes as a journalist for German television I was working on a piece that was focused on there a rash of crime that had taken place in the United States specifically tourist directed crime in Florida and during the course of that piece we talked about safety tips for German tourists that would be traveling to the United States.
Hello and her mother had scheduled their own Florida vacation before the crime spree started we decided to keep our plans of flying into Miami and then going on to the Florida Keys just for four days very brief stay but particularly because I had just done this piece about safety tips.
And felt that my awareness was you know pretty strong at that point.
Their vacation was relaxing and uneventful.
A return to the airport was not.
They got lost looking for the airport rental car area.
Hello good drove onto a side street to turn around she soon realized someone was following her.
The man reached through the window put the car into park disconnected the horn and assaulted the two my mother said take whatever you want but please don't hurt us the passenger from their vehicle said shut up bitch we're going to kill you.
Both of the perpetrators were coming taking turns beating me through my window and.
You know every punch that I took we can to me.
The attackers tried desperately to grab the car keys I was able to get in a good couple flows myself.
The got the car into gear and drove away to try to stop her the attacker better on.
I hit the driver from their car with the front of our car after a short distance the man was forced to let go.
I had tremendous injuries to my head my neck my back dislocated jaw loss of feeling in my left side of my face which I've never regained.
And down the bite wound was very painful.
To the punch somebody almost killing paralyzing her and biting her and destroy her life.
Some need for that at all.
L. the described the attackers as young man approximately twenty five years old they were driving a large dark colored car with tinted windows.
This crimes happen and take place in less than two minutes it's a hit it's a it's a it's an assault and it happens in a matter of just.
So positive identification of the suspect might be difficult.
With no other witnesses or leave.
Police hoped held this car would contain the forensic evidence they need.
In nineteen ninety three twenty four year old hell go lose barely escape with your life after a harrowing encounter with two men who attempted to overpower.
Two different detectives some food down and laurel of faith with the Hialeah Florida robbery squad were assigned to the case.
This would happen about ten blocks north of the airport and.
It'S a mixed residential commercial neighborhood.
That neighborhood surrounds leisureland road the only exit or entrance to the airport here criminals often lying in wait for their victims.
It'S the main artery it's easy to hide it's easy to follow.
One way in and one way out of Miami International Airport.
Hunters are hunting for robbery victims it could have been your family they could have been anybody in the community I'm sure as they followed her in a tailed her and targeted her on the discussion was how how were they going to do it and when were they going to do it in what manner.
At the time rental cars were easily identified with stickers of the rental company and special license plates beginning with the letter Y. or Z..
Despite the increase in tourist crimes south Florida's overall crime rate was less than the previous year.
Never the less the press coverage had an impact.
Miami was being hit with tourists robbery cases almost on a daily basis this is a city that.
They viewed as a violent city and they had no interest in coming back years.
European governments discouraged travel to Florida and hotel reservations drop by twenty five percent.
Ending the crime spree was difficult victims were often unwilling to return to Florida for court hearings and trials.
This kept criminals on the streets.
Most of the crimes were a bump and rob leaving behind little forensic evidence but hello this robbery had been unusually violent.
She had a bite mark located on her upper arm it was rather clear I have sexual battery background and no.
That they were developing by mark comparison techniques and the state of the art place to process or was the photo lab the medical examiner's office.
She'S very sharp to immediately address that before the victim left or before the victim sought treatment perhaps sutures or other medical treatment which can damage or alter the bite marks on the victims are.
Held a greed to have the forensic photographer takes pictures of the wound.
It'S not enough just to take a photograph it has to be measured properly it has to be put into perspective it has to be documented properly it's important to get it done as quickly as he can things change very rapidly skin tends to discolor bruising tends to set in.
In every picture forensic protocol requires the use of a ruler to provide scales sent L. ruler it has three circles on it that allows us to make sure that our cameras perpendicular to our subject and that will also give us a sense of scale we take the flash only hold it off to an angle where we can emphasize the surface texture of the skin.
And forensic photographers take pictures under many different light sources conventional light ultraviolet infrared and fluorescent.
The show detail and texture not revealed by light in the visible spectrum.
Many times there's something there that you can't see with the naked eye.
After what investigators examined the rental car hoping to find fingerprints.
Fortunately the weather was against us processing the outside a vehicle was impossible.
The car was wet because Helga had driven through a thunderstorm on the way to the airport.
The interior material was textured which shielded no usable prints.
No fingerprints no witnesses and no suspects.
Helga and her mother left Miami not knowing whether the crime would ever be solved.
And maybe it wouldn't have been at the perpetrator not left behind a piece of forensic evidence.
Three weeks after helical looses assault she was asked to return to Florida to look through stacks of mugshots.
She didn't see her attacker.
Then the detective showed her a photo array of six suspects how to look at the lineup and should look at each patrol car fully once he got to his pitcher test on the chorus but Germany is seen immediate reaction her physically anybody reaction when I saw the defendants face.
It was very very weird mix of emotions one of joy because I found him.
And one of complete terror.
Because it was the first time I've seen that face since it was locked on my own biting through the muscle.
Twenty four year old Stanley cornet was a factory worker with a long criminal history.
Since the terrorist attacks happened in different jurisdictions near the airport police formed a task force to exchange information.
That'S how the faith first learned about Stanley cornet he was arrested a few days after Helga's attack for a nearly identical crime.
He allegedly stopped an elderly man in a rental car and robbed him at gun point but he picked on the wrong man.
The victim's son was a Miami policeman who lived just across the street.
He called for his son and he came running out of the house will struggle ensued and the victim tried to hold back the robber Wallace calling for his son and the robber at that time.
The similarities in the crimes were striking but despite the identification cornet denied he assaulted held the loose.
I have tried a number of these cases previously and the issue was always whether the identification was enough to pass muster with the jury especially on a on a case where all you have is a single I. D. in a robbery case were were took no longer than twenty thirty seconds.
So investigators wanted to know if there was any way to tell whether cornet was the man held his arm.
To find out police went to the same forensic experts who matched a bite wound to the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy follow up bite marks if it's a good one you can actually get a dental profile of the suspect for instance an outline of what his teeth look like if there's a gap or crooked teeth or whatever.
That profile can exclude a suspect or increase the likelihood that he made the bite mark.
Doctors who were on hand the photos of hell does bite wound but he needed cornet's dental impression for comparison.
Cornet refused to cooperate.
You'Re not going to touch me basically is what he said.
Just basically you know what you're not getting anything out of my mouth.
Except maybe the swear words.
They left empty handed but returned later with a court order specifying the use of force if necessary at which time he reiterated that he didn't want to cooperate he wasn't going to open his mouth the doctors to run very casually brought out what's called a John Jack four on opening the jaws of cadavers there in full rigor mortis input in the joint you ratchet on this thing and it could it open any it'll break your jaw if you try to resist partner when Stanley was shown the judge Jack Stanley decided he wanted to cooperate supplies with dental impressions I had so we obtained our dental impressions from Stanley corner.
From those impressions Dr silver on made these plaster models which allowed him to duplicate the bite patterns.
Test bites are made either in wax or in styrofoam to be able to analyze the patterns that these teeth are gonna leave.
For further evaluation the biting edges of the plaster teeth are blackened and the pattern copied on clear acetate for easy comparison with the photographs.
Odontology just use a number of different techniques because there's no way to accurately estimate the elasticity of the victim's skin.
The chiefs have variables the skin has variables in when this lady was bitten she didn't just sit there and let this man you know biter is hard as he could.
We'Re showing this is the dynamic of the fight with movement going on in key numbers twenty four twenty five the the March should be zero point two and then is the fight moved the twenty six to make it.
There is no such thing as a bite impression match.
All the experts can say is whether a bite wound is consistent with the person's teeth even if they are it's still not a hundred percent certain.
But with the model wax impression acetates and precision photographs Dr silver on zeroed in on three lower teeth in the bite mark which were slightly crooked overlapping.
Even to one train dies it looks like our next team because the bite wound in the photographs Dr Seuss Iran was confident in his assessment his teeth were consistent with that bite and there was nothing that they could exclude him.
Stanley cornet was charged with attempted robbery and aggravated battery.
But cornett said he was innocent and that he had an alibi.
A jury would have to decide which side they believed the alibi for the bike impression at that.
The ironic situation of having done Anne's piece about safety tips.
And then going to Florida and becoming part of the crime statistics even when you think you have all the tools at your disposal to keep yourself safe if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time anything can happen.
As the trial approach for the brutal assault hello the news Stanley cornet claimed he had an alibi that he had been at work at the time of the crime.
His work record showed that he was indeed at work that day.
Cornet'S coal worker said he didn't always punch the time clock when leaving for a break and he worked just ten minutes away from where healthcare was attacked.
His supervisor remembers that day in particular and remember he left and never came back he was soon after look go out that job because of that so that now to dial by it's incredible that an individual would punch a time card go to work like we all do in the morning and he he would leave during his break and go commit a violent crime against interest but that's precisely what's family court it did.
Through various legal tactics cornet delaying his trial.
If my victim doesn't want to cooperate then I have no case and that's what these criminals count on that's why they targeted tourists and in this case it picked the wrong tourist and Stanley cornet was relying on wearing a loose down to the point where she just gave up he underestimated how come loose she was going to wear down she came back for every trial date every appointment she flew back for.
At the trials hello again identified cornet as the man who attacked her.
Facing Stanley cornet in court was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do through all of my testimony the defendant had a smirk on his face.
So I tried really hard not to focus on him and focus on the prosecutor and the jury and the judge the people that were there to embrace justice.
Sarah T. of the by depression photographs taken by a qualified forensic photographer alongside the cast of cornets teeth were what ultimately convinced the jury.
Stanley cornet was found guilty of attempted robbery and aggravated battery.
Because he was a repeat offender he was sentenced to life in prison I tell the detectives if you have a bite mark case don't tell the Senate that you have a bite because they certainly can alter their teeth it happened two weeks ago where the defendant when I saw it had all of his upper and lower front teeth pulled while I was in prison he told me to to say can they pull these teeth.
As a prosecutor at the time if it was someone new to me imagine how new it was to a jury they had certainly never heard of anything remotely similar to bite mark evidence the bite mark evidence I think sealed this case on it put the final nail in Stanley cornets coffin as far as the jury is concerned I think it was our strongest piece of.
Cornet'S accomplice in the crime was never identified.
By the end of nineteen ninety three the crimes against vacation travelers in South Florida stopped.
Police increased their surveillance of the rental car areas.
Rental agencies remove their stickers from the cars and ended the practice of identifiable license plates.
After her ordeal held to form an advocacy group for victims of crime called witness justice.
She can meet them on a totally different level that a police officer came.
And she can advocate for them she can be their voice when sometimes they can't find their voice maybe it'll be the hell because of this world that make more victims come back to court and get more convictions.
