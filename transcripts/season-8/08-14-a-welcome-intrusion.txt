A young woman complained about a shuttle van driver who took her home from the airport.
A few days later there was a confrontation that left both the passenger and the driver.
Police first thought the incident was revenge.
The blood patterns and old hammer and the hastily scrawled note told forensic scientist something really different.
In August of nineteen ninety five thirty two year old Donald winger and infant daughter Bailey flew into the Saint Louis airport after spending a week in Florida visiting her parents.
During the ride home the shuttle van driver Roger Harrington drove a radically and exceeded the speed limit he also said he heard voices telling him to kill people.
At home Donna documented the details of the incident.
I felt as if my life and the life of my daughter in the hands of a not.
When she and her husband reported the incident to the shuttle van company Herrington was suspended.
The winger's hope that would be the end of their involvement with Roger Harrington.
They were wrong.
Springfield police what is your emergency.
When police arrived they found on a winner face down on the dining room floor.
Roger Harrington lay a few feet away on his back.
Paramedics rushed him to the hospital where you were both pronounced dead on arrival we all lost something in our hearts.
When she lost a lifetime to be a mommy.
Daughter sister friend we've all lost everybody lost.
Mark winger told police he was in the basement when he heard a commotion upstate he grabbed his pistol ran into the hallway saw Harrington beating his wife with a hammer.
And killed him.
Mark blurted out this is the man that's been stalking my wife says the man has been harassing my family we did ask mark why Roger would be over at his house on that day.
Mark said that he had no idea.
Police found Roger Harrington's car parked in front of the winger house.
Donna'S hand written account of what happened in the van with Harrington was on the refrigerator door that was the one piece of evidence that Donna spoke to us.
She was not alive so we couldn't ask for what it occurred but she did document what happened on the ride with bar transportation from Saint Louis and that was supportive of March tracks.
Background check revealed Harrington had a history of mental illness and the twice been hospitalized for psychiatric treatment he was an individual that like many Americans have a mental illness and it was being addressed.
The hammer Harrington used to attack Donna winger had been on the dining room table.
Donna wanted a picture hung in the house to remind.
Mark Hey hang the picture she placed a picture in the hammer on a table.
so mark will remember to hang the picture.
Also on the table were Harrington's coffee mug and a pack of cigarettes.
Police speculated that Harrington sought revenge for the wingers complaint.
Immediately determined that is more plausible that a mentally ill subject had attacked Donna and killed her.
When the investigation was over.
Mark winger was called a hero for trying to save his wife Natalie had lost his precious wife but he also had to shoot the man.
Trying to protect her.
The newspaper published a letter mark Weiner wrote thanking the community for its support.
Roger Harrington's family refused to believe it I never have ever seen Roger B. violence to anybody.
Four years later.
Check evidence came to light that raised new questions about what really happened that day and the winners home.
And Joe DiMaggio children's hospital in Hollywood Florida.
On a winger's family established a memorial plate room in her memory we are making this.
We are thankfully estranged his life around but only after many many months of difficult adversities and tribulations.
Back in Springfield Illinois mark when they're married his daughter's nanny Rebekah Simic and together had three more children.
Although four years have passed Donna winger's best friend Dan Shilts was still having a difficult time.
She was suffering from such a deep depression she had to be institutionalized she was given electro convulsive therapy to treat her depression probably the most extreme measure you can go to to try to become while she was on numerous medications for.
She was not getting any better.
One day she tells her doctor.
This is what I know.
This is been burning me this is what I now.
The doctor says you've got to tell someone about this.
Our story was devastating.
Dan told us that she had an affair with mark winger.
Prior to and after the murders taking place.
The end said her depression was caused by her suspicions about Donna's death.
Motive was that he wanted out of the marriage and D. N. was under the impression because rings have been purchased that at some point they would be married.
But after Donna's death mark didn't marry demand as she had hoped instead he married his daughter's name.
An effort to get back at him.
Because they're no longer together she is the the the jilted individual.
Hotel receipts and telephone records confirm dans claims of the affair.
Police were faced with another discrepancy.
Mark winger told police he had fired two shots into Roger Harrington but a neighbor reported hearing because of perhaps five minutes in between the two shots.
The recording of the nine one one call mark winger made to police told a similar story.
He says there's a manager and he has a bullet in his head on the nine one one tape if you listen to it is there a bullet.
In the background.
You can hear a man.
Was it possible that while mark was on the phone he realized that Harrington was still alive and then Sean Harrington the second time.
Lieutenant Doug Williams and always had been nagging doubts about mark winger story.
At the time his superiors disagreed and the case was closed.
That day of the murder and for at least several weeks if not months after the murder occurred most people at the police department that were there on the scene thought that March story was true.
And Williamson was also bothered by the fact that paramedics found on a winger face down on the floor.
If mark cradled his wife in his arms as he claimed.
Why would he put her face down.
In the case file four three photographs of the crime scene shot before the victims were taken to the hospital.
The bodies were not in the position mark originally described.
When you look at the pictures Rogers head is facing the same direction it's Donna said so it's not possible that he fell backwards as market repeatedly as stated during interviews.
The photographs of the death scene we're never compared to the statements swinger had made to the police.
That little read my report in the find the pictures been placed in evidence and find either that night or the next morning.
The final straw may have been the multi million dollar lawsuit mark winger filed against a transportation company that employed Roger Harrington.
Police decided to re opened their investigation and called in some of the world's best forensic scientists to help.
Four years after the shooting.
The St Springfield Illinois took a closer look into what really happened that day between mark winger Roger Harrington and Donna winner.
Mark we are told police that he ran down this hallway and saw Roger Harrington facing him kneeling on the floor striking his wife with a hammer.
Winner says he shot Harrington twice in the head.
But the physical evidence contradicted this story.
Ballistic tests on wingers pistol showed the shells are rejected back to the right mark winger when he told us that he fired that first shot he indicated he was standing in his hallway.
Therefore that showcasing could not have landed where we found it in the dining.
And there was evidence Roger Harrington's body had been moved before the second shot was fired.
On the floor were two separate pools of Roger Harrington's blood.
The smaller pools where he was shot the first time later he was turned over and shot again that's where he was at rest the longest.
In that larger pool of blood what's in a bowl.
Forty five caliber semiautomatic project this was consistent with the next door neighbor story that she heard one shot then a long pause before hearing a second shot.
To analyze the blood spatter police turn to world renowned forensic blood stain pattern analyst Tom bevel in the winger case we were taking the physical evidence and ultimately comparing it against the statements that were given by mark when.
First if Roger Harrington had been striking Donna winger traces of Donna's blood would have been on his shirt but the only blot on Harrington sure it was his own.
When your story that Harrington fell backwards after he was shot was not only inconsistent with the crime scene photographs it was physically impossible.
He would literally have to either do a back flip for levitate or some sort of a circus act in order to get to his feet point away from her body as well as the length of his body his height also away from her.
This is real life this is not the movies when you get shot a lot of times when people get shot on the movies news very violent movies people get blown backwards the body whole body gets up and moves.
Finally the blood spatter evidence shows that who never struck down a winger did so from an entirely different location than the one mark described.
When a person is hit with an object it produces what is called castoff blood spatter.
Blood is being cast off in the direction that I'm swinging and if there's a close enough object you'll go for example.
Castoff blood spatter of Donna's blood on the walls and ceilings shows that Donna had walked down the hall towards the dining room stopped then turned towards the front door as if trying to get a.
And was attacked from behind.
A single elongated castoff blood spatter Adonis blood identified as stain number seven was on mark winners right sleeve.
Apple says this proves mark winger was closer to Donna during the attack that he admitted which then makes it much more consistent that he is the person that is delivering the blows verses Harrington.
Police found evidence that mark winger had invited Roger Harrington to come over to his house that day.
Harrington'S roommates told investigators that mark Weiner called Harrington at home gave Harrington his address and the time for the meeting four thirty.
Corroborating that was a note found in Harrington's car with the winner's home address and the time for thirty.
Roger Harrington's family hoped that a court of law would vindicate their son and convict the man they always believed was responsible for Donna winger staff.
I believe that mark winger is a cold calculated.
He thought he could outsmart everyone.
And he was unable to do so.
In nineteen ninety five investigators called mark when you're my hero for fatally shooting an intruder who he claimed was attacking his wife.
Four years later there was a dramatic change of opinion.
Mark the winner was charged with the murder of both Roger Harrington and his own wife don.
This is exactly the sort of apply that to a fiction writer would love to work up as is often said you know reality is stranger than fiction and and in this case are almost like that fits the bill.
The motive was partially financial.
Donna had two hundred thousand dollars worth of life insurance and mark was suing the shuttle bus company as well.
He made the mistake of being just a little too greedy he had the perfect crime.
And he blew it because.
He wanted to press forward and see if you can get more money.
And marks mistress DeAngelis told prosecutors that mark no longer wanted Donna as his wife.
Donna'S bizarre trip with shuttle van driver Roger Harrington gave mark the perfect setup he needed to commit murder.
He knew that was the guy.
And then set things in motion to get him inside his house.
After Harrington was suspended from his job the evidence shows that mark called Harrington inviting him over to discuss the matter with the hope of settling it amicably.
Barrington showed up at four thirty the time he wrote on his note and walked in with his coffee Cup cigarettes.
Hardly the weapons of the psychotic killer.
Prosecutors believe mark winger walked Carrington to the refrigerator possibly to see Donna's note mark then pulled the gun ordered Harrington to its knees and fired a single shot into his head.
The next door neighbor that shot.
So did don a winger she turned towards the front door.
Mark get her with the hammer causing the cast off of blood spatter area inconsistent with his statements to police.
During the call.
Realized Harrington was still alive.
Instead of going to a doctor's room winger turned Harrington over.
And shot him a second time.
The neighbor heard this second shot five minutes after the first one.
He finished him off he executed until the case is a shot in the head both times but that last one ensured that Roger Harrington did not survive.
I also have a one moments later the dispatcher called back.
I mean what's going on.
The police photographs taken as paramedics arrived showed Roger Harrington street pointed in the same direction as Donna's inconsistent with their husband story.
Picture'S worth a thousand words it shows the thousand words mark gave us our correct their ally.
Although mark Wenger maintains his innocence he was tried and convicted of two murders and sentenced to life in prison without parole.
The forensic evidence proved Roger Harrington was not a killer.
And in a sense they call in the middle of a diabolical scheme of merger.
The forensics are absolutely crucial.
Roger has been the villain and mark has been the hero and now we we come to find out that of Harrington's name has been unjustifiably smeared Roger was not a violent individual he was not a homicidal maniac as mark tried to betray him he was an individual that like many Americans have a mental illness or had a mental illness and it was being addressed.
The beauty of friends together I say this many times the beauty of a fingerprint the beauty of DNA is it doesn't have an interest bias prejudice or.
It is what it is.
And that constant of the forensics in this case.
Showed the other evidence for what what it let it be a building block to show the judge and the jury our community what happened and I was thankful that we have.
I hope someday I can meet you face to face.
