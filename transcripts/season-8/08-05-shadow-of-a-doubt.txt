An unknown assailant walked into a retail store and fired three shots.
Killing the owner.
Police said suspects but all had alibis.
Marin six scientists found more than a crime perpetrated in broad daylight.
In the shadows was a killer.
Adam is a particularly pretty time in spring Grove Pennsylvania.
Landscape photographers and local artists usually found their way here to the gray fox gallery the owner Jennifer Myers was a well known picture framer.
Just a wonderful woman a wonderful mother a wonderful life and a good friend to a lot of people managing a retail shop is an easy one year earlier Jennifer was robbed in the store at gunpoint.
Since then her husband Steve stopped in every afternoon on his way home from work at the local factory.
Most afternoon visits were uneventful by October twentieth nineteen ninety seven was different.
Ringo okay Sir thank you no I don't see where.
When police arrived Jennifer was dead on the floor behind the counter.
She had been shot three times.
Several workers nearby said they heard popping noises a few hours earlier around one PM no one thought they were gonna fire.
Several witnesses saw a man with long black hair running from the shopping center sometime around one PM.
This was someone that went in there with the sole intent to kill the victim there was no struggle a fight didn't precipitate this homicide a robbery didn't precipitate this.
No money was missing from the cash register or Jennifer's purse.
Something like this happens people feel as though their world has somewhat been changed and their sense of security is gone because of something like this can happen in spring Grove Pennsylvania.
It can happen anywhere.
This brazen attack in a busy retail area at mid day told police that the killer was willing to risk everything kills Jennifer Myers it's somebody who definitely wanted her dead they had a problem with her.
And excluding robbery is being a motive.
that's we just are looking at who wanted Jennifer Myers dad.
A ballistic examination identified the murder weapon as either a three fifty seven or thirty eight caliber revolver.
That'S a there's a database as far as register hand guns so we begin to look at that and we found that Siva Myers did have a three fifty seven PM.
Steve Myers willingly turned over the pistol for forensic analysis but he didn't resemble the man seen running near the shop earlier in the day.
Witnesses said they heard popping sounds which police suspected were gunfire near the gray fox picture frame shop around one o'clock in the afternoon.
Approximately two hours later Steve Myers discovered his wife Jennifer shot to death on the floor of the store.
Another witness saw a man running from the area wearing light blue jeans and a blue plaid flannel shirt we believe that this shooter came in the store use a bullet style tackle her walking right towards her firing the first shot and striking her in the shoulder area.
And then firing a second shot striking her in the abdomen the last shot to the face.
Ballistic experts examined the bullet fragments recovered from the victim and concluded the killer used to thirty eight or three fifty seven caliber revolver.
The victim's husband Steve owned a three fifty seven revolver.
When the bullets from the crime scene were compared to those test fired from Steve Mars revolver analysts concluded they were not a match.
Police also confirmed that Steve Myers was at work when the murder took place you need an alibi but as far as him being at work that just was one more piece to fit in that he was not involved in this killing whatsoever.
Police had another promising lead.
Jennifer'S murder took place just one day before she was scheduled to testify against forty year old Kevin Dowling the man Jennifer claimed had robbed her at gunpoint a year earlier okay one now we have perhaps a motive for someone to want.
Kevin downing had the opportunity to commit the murder since he was free on bail that day however when questioned by police downing said he had an alibi.
He was fishing on a boat in money run late story confirmed by his wife.
This is down was very cooperative she truly believed that her husband was not involved in this homicide whatsoever and therefore is very helpful in proving her husband's innocence.
Downing also had evidence to support his alibi he said he made a home video of his fishing trip that day his wife willingly turn the video over to police.
Because I wanted to help prove him innocent that he did not do this so I was more than happy to help them and it was sort of like a slap in the face for them haha he did not do it if this is true tape of him fishing.
It'S an airtight alibi I want to secure it there is evidence so that there's no further questions.
The first thing police noticed was that the video tape was recorded with the date and time of day the footage was shot.
The tapes show Darling fishing in the middle of the lake from ten forty six in the morning until four PM on the day of Jennifer Myers murder.
Muddy run lake was a forty five minute drive away from Jennifer store.
Downing also had store receipts for fish bait and the branch.
But something about the videotape looked.
He'S trying to get something on tape of him fishing but this is clearly not someone who's interested in catching the fish.
Kevin darlings family confirmed the tape was made on October twentieth the date of the merger.
In fact that evening when he came home and my girls were home after dinner we all sat around and watched the tape of them together.
On the tape Kevin spoke to his children about his impending robbery trial he also expressed his hope that if convicted the children would not miss behave while he was imprisoned.
My main concern is what's gonna happen.
They seem to perfect.
As far as.
Kevin downing insisted he did not kill Jennifer Myers despite the fact that she was scheduled to testify against him in an upcoming robbery trial.
Dowling also had an alibi claiming he was fishing at the time of the merger and he offered this time and date stamp video tape as evidence.
Contains scenes shot from ten in the morning until after four PM Jennifer's murder took place around one PM and her story was only forty five minutes away from the lake.
Dowling'S videotape gave him an airtight alibi.
But police were still suspicious.
Although Dowling shot scenes throughout the day the entire running time of the tape was only twelve minutes.
She talked sometimes it takes about catching fish yet you never saw any fish from the tape which again struck me odd that if you're catching fish we want to show them on your videotape.
Something else about the tape bothered Mowery Kevin Dowling repeatedly glanced at his wrist watch which struck because on his views on a casual day of fishing line he was so concerned about the time of day.
In some parts of the tape darlings watch face the camera.
Investigators isolated and in March clips of the watch.
Mari asked scientists at the federal bureau of investigation to try digital enhancement.
The tape quality was too poor for the process to work.
Determining the time when dialing shot the video was critical since police were well aware that the time and date stamp can be manipulated the sun was out periodically throughout the tape and was casting very good shadowing by determining shadowing positioning can we work backwards and calculate the time a day using the sun its position in the sky.
Detectives posed the question to NASA scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center in greenbelt Maryland.
Surprisingly NASA identified a local astro physicist to help them the guy that could probably do this was right our own backyard and I would be doctor Robert Boyle at Dickinson college.
Dr Robert Boyle is an associate professor of physics and astronomy.
When he first saw the tape he wasn't optimistic.
Heart just dropped because this was clearly not going to be a cut and dried case of all their shadows use them like sundials you can tell the time because here was a picture where the camera was on moving both.
As the earth rotates the position of the sun changes creating different shadows.
When using the sun to tell time to characteristics are observe the sons high overhead or altitude and its direction along the horizon or as a math north point being zero degrees as with the east point being ninety degrees south point being a hundred eighty degrees west point two hundred and seventy degrees.
Boyle said he needed more than just the videotape to conduct a study he needed specific scientific information he would need some measurements of the boat you need the measurements Kevin dialing you need the measurements of the hat Kevin ward of ideo.
The most crucial piece of information Dr boiled needed was the magnetic north compass heading up the boat when the videotape was shot.
To find out police took the same boat on to muddy run lake and identified its exact location by matching the landscape shown on the tape then they identified the heading of the boat with the compass out of the eight frames that professor or given us we believe that we had matched seven of the frames and we used a degree of plus or minus five degrees as far as our degree of accuracy.
Next using an artist's model a light bulb and the protractor Dr Boyle calculated the sun's azimuth or direction based on the shadows.
The model represented Kevin Dowling.
Dr Boyle adjusted the light to produce the same shadows that were in the video.
The protractor identified the sun's position based on the angle between the model and the light essentially measure the angle between the direction of the camera in the direction of the sun which is being mimicked by labels.
Dr Boyle used the Voyager two computer program which identified the sun's exact position in fifteen minute increments on the day of the murder.
When he compared the exact position of the sun to the shadows on the video Dr Boyle discovered that the times stamp on some of the scenes were bogus.
Late afternoon time stamps could very well have been correct there was a whole bunch of times in the middle the just word were inconsistent with the astronomical data.
For example in this scene.
The background analysis shows the downing is facing north get stamped eleven twenty four in the morning.
But you can see that the sun is clearly positioned to Darling's left which is west.
At eleven twenty four the sun would be in the east.
Dr Boyle estimates this scene was shot closer to three PM.
Kevin downing now had the opportunity to commit this crime because he was not one twenty one like at one o'clock in the afternoon.
And he also had a motive.
But prosecutors needed more than shadows on videotape to get a murder conviction.
Two when police confronted Kevin Dowling with the scientific evidence that his time and date stamp video tape was a forgery Darling confessed not to Jennifer Myers merger.
He now said that after a few hours of fishing he went to a nearby strip club and alters the times on the videotape so that his wife wouldn't find out.
I don't need to point out the the strangeness of that theory a first of all why do videotape yourself at all why did you just say I decided when I videotaped myself of course his wife would have never been the wiser.
The videotape revealed something else.
Dowling was wearing clothes similar to the man witnesses saw running from Jennifer Meyer store I do not want to believe that my husband the father my children could do something like this to another human being.
Police found the clothes Dowling was wearing on the fishing trip in his home they sent them to AJ skip will pull an internationally recognized expert in forensic gunshot residue.
When a pistol is fired the firing pin.
Ignites the elements in the project which then turned into a gas.
The gases solidify into tiny particles which are then deposited on the hands clothing in immediate proximity of the discharge.
Detest clothing for gunshot residue Strobel first used an adhesive to extract any microscopic particles.
The particles were placed in a scanning electron microscope which subjected them to extreme magnification and provided an elemental analysis.
An electron beam bombarded the samples causing the elements within to emit characteristic X. rays the characteristic X. rays show up on the video screen speaks or pulses at different energy levels each energy level is assigned an element.
Tests revealed gunshot residue on the left side of each of Kevin darlings garments this was significant since Dowling was left handed we find that every item had to some extent some gunshot residue present.
Prosecutors say Kevin Dowling carefully planned to eliminate Jennifer Myers to prevent her from testifying against him in his robbery trial.
On the day of the murder Darling went fishing on Monday run lake and used his video camera till eleven forty five.
Wearing a wig as a disguise Dowling enter Jennifer store around one PM.
The gun powder residue embedded deep into short fiber is invisible to the naked eye but perfectly clear to forensic scientists.
Dowling was back in his boat on the lake sometime around two PM.
When he reset the time on his video camera to eleven twenty four he never realized that he was a human sundial.
I would like to kick his ass he has no remorse at all and then you wonder how sick this man really S. when he has no remorse for what he's done.
And that is very scary.
Despite the forensic evidence Kevin Dowling insisted he was innocent but he was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to death by lethal injection.
His wife Joanne says she knew nothing of her husband's Secret Life.
Considers the death sentence too lenient.
I truly hate Kevin Dowling for everything he stands for the person he is what he did to people I hate him more than I can even explain why you can't ever forget the the infamous fishing tape because.
How ridiculous is it to think that he would get away with something like that I mean there's technology today that's going to determine that this tape has been doctored it's one thing to have a motive to kill it's another thing to actually prove to someone did it and the forensics were able to give us the proof necessary considering they never found the murder weapon it's amazing what they can do nowadays and without a lot of people go free.
It'S ironic of course we often talk about fighting shadows don't want and in this case the shadows were actually.
