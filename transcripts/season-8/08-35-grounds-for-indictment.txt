It was a drive by shooting that left one man dead and another seriously wounded.
A witness said the perpetrator was driving a red jeep.
There were thousands of vehicles just like it but it was nothing more than a handful of dirt that made one stand out from all the others.
Front royal Virginia is an area steeped in civil war history.
And the nearby Shenandoah river makes this a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts from hundreds of miles away.
Very laid back community mainly mountains for hunting and fishing is the main things to do in our area.
On the night of September twenty six two thousand two there was a terrible rainstorm.
A motorist driving by the low water bridge sought to man on the ground bleeding next to a truck he immediately called police.
Both men have suffered serious gunshot wounds.
The man on the driver's side of the truck twenty year old Joe Kovaleski was still alive but just barely.
He'S in dire straits.
Leeson was no stranger to law enforcement always been trouble I've actually charged him with robbery before and salute to a lan and picked him up.
Police found two empty twelve gauge shot gun shells on the ground nearby along with three cellular telephones everybody has a cellphone but very few people have multiple cellphones so therefore there's possible drug involvement and the an aspect of this crime.
Investigators found drug paraphernalia in the victim's car and they were circular tire tracks nearby a possible indication the man had been ambushed.
Since it was a cold rainy dark night we didn't think someone was just down there and enjoying the beauty of the river and the in the woods in that area.
The inclement weather made gathering evidence almost impossible.
The head that's about a truck reign in blood all over the place.
Couple shot gun shell casings and one dead bodies the so it was a.
Reality check real quick.
Joe Kovaleski was in a coma for several days when he finally regained consciousness he said very little about the incident except that the shooter was driving a red jeep.
I saw it coming around to the right side of my truck and fishtail stop.
He thought it was it was the police thought it was a flash bang a distraction.
Investigators hoped that forensic evidence could help find the driver of the mysterious red G..
Investigators found two shotgun shells at the scene of a double shooting that wounded Joe Kovaleski and killed his co worker tightly from.
J. Mason a firearms expert with the Virginia division of forensic science examined the evidence.
I was asked to make any determination I could as to the number of shots that were fired and the direction angle which they were fired from from the evidence Mason concluded that at least four shots were fired during the attack.
Mason also wanted to determine how far away the shooter was from his victim so he fired the same type of shotgun shells at varying distances to analyze the dispersion of the pallets then compared them to the shot gun holes in the victim's truck there is a rule of thumb that we can use which states that we expect to find an inch diameter pattern.
For every three feet or yards of distance after the first yard.
It was a two inch wide color pattern on the passenger door of the truck.
Indicating the killer was between six and nine feet away.
The trajectory revealed the gun was pointed upwards this would be consistent with someone firing from a vehicle pulled up alongside the victim's vehicle and firing from the window of the vehicle.
The ballistic evidence suggested that the skid marks near the victim's truck were most likely those of the killer.
But analyzing tire impressions was impossible because the parking area was mostly gravel.
Police also recovered three cell phones at the scene of the murder one was Joe Kovaleski he's the other belonged to the dead victims tie lace.
Assumption on our part was that the one that was found on the ground on the passenger side possibly could have been the suspect's cellphone maybe drop by accident.
Cell phone records revealed that the third song belong to Julie grubs who was a friend of both victims.
She lived in Annandale Virginia about an hour's drive away I knew that she was heavily into drugs I had heard that she was in two different ways of obtaining money.
Different things so I I my opinion of her was not high at all and investigators found something else.
A second cell phone registered to Julie Grubbs was used to call tie late then twenty two times in the hours leading up to the shooting.
It doesn't strike you as odd as the phone calls being made to somebody and it was stretches out is the sheer amount of the phone calls in the and the town allotment leading up to the murder.
The last call was just minutes before the merger and all of a sudden his call stop at seven fifty six PM then there's obviously some incident that happened at seven fifty six PM that he did not make any more phone calls.
Investigators were about to interview Julie grubs when they developed another leading.
Hi Lisa had told friends that he was involved in drug trafficking with the sheriff's deputy Kevin Kinsey who is a supervisor at the work release center we're late and was living.
Skews my language but they'd have all our prostitutes come up and they're all kind of stuff we deal with like two investigations at the same time because Kevin Kinsey did no Tyree life and.
And then now you have the possibility or the theory was Kevin Kinsey involved in shooting himself.
With the allegation that a sheriff's deputy might somehow be involved the F. B. I. was brought in to assist the investigation.
Also Joe Coveleski survived the shooting that killed his friend Tyler Layton Coveleski wasn't immediately forthcoming in his interviews with police.
Kovaleski was also suspicious of law enforcement since he knew Kyleigh Finn was involved in drug trafficking with a sheriff's deputy.
The killer is still out there on the loose I was defenses in hospital I can get away.
Yes I was.
Kovaleski said he went with the tide of the low water bridge to buy drugs then a red jeep approached and someone inside opened fire.
But he never saw the shooter space.
But the sheriff's deputy Kevin Kinsey didn't own a red jeep can see had been implicated in dealing in illegal drugs with the dead victim tie lace and.
There are other suspects Julie grubs didn't own a red jeep either.
But when police visited rubs apartment they noticed a red jeep in the parking lot.
A check of motor vehicles revealed a jeep belonging to Julie's boyfriend.
Phelps was allegedly involved in dealing in illegal drugs and both new tie Layton and Joe Kovaleski the times it I assume strong out.
Five day binges of smoking meth and crack and.
Talking about how much life hurts literally talking about how much of a rush would be to kill somebody.
During the surveillance of Phelps red jeep investigators soft belts walked towards his vehicle with some cleaning materials if you've been given an opportunity to wash away any blood or DNA evidence that had been transferred from the homicide scene to the jeep and it doesn't take much to war seven things away so ultimately we we had to act it was it was that important that we could not let him clean that G..
After confiscating the jeep investigators search Julie drops apartment and found the cell phone used to call tie late on the night of the shooting.
They also found twelve hundred dollars in cash marijuana PCP and crystal methamphetamine.
But they didn't find the shot gun used in the shooting.
Dolson grubs both denied any involvement in the murder they claimed they were both in crops apartment in Annandale more than sixty miles away from the crime scene.
But investigators noticed something unusual on felt G..
A lot of dried mud in the wheel wells.
Here you have G. supposedly is in Annandale you don't have reporter you don't have so much to her personally if you would ask for or or concrete.
To see if this dirt could link it to the murder scene investigators contacted forensic geologist Dr Eric Jonker.
One of the most important things that we do within forensic science try to solve what we call a forensic triad and this is where we link the victim suspect in crime scene together that triangle if we can make that work is crucial to most of our investigations.
Dr John says that mineral ratios erosion and other environmental factors can often distinguish one soil sample from another that makes everything unique so that basically the idea that the soil is dirt is dirt no matter where you go and it doesn't change for miles around dirt is different thirty feet apart from each other.
First soil samples were carefully collected from the jeeps wheel wells.
Then they were put through a series of mesh sieves to separate the course materials from the fine.
Under a microscope.
Dr John saw a lot of common materials like clay and vegetation but he also found something else a sparkling blue fragment he identified as as you're right.
And an emerald green malachite fragment both work copper based minerals they're not very strong and typically you can take these particles in your fingers and just grind it all fall apart without much trouble at all.
It told me that there had to be a source for these minerals nearby because these are not going to be transported twenty or thirty miles downstream.
The murder took place at low water bridge just a few feet away from the Shenandoah river.
Investigators discovered the just one mile upstream was a working quarry.
We'Ve all seen people look for copper bracelets for long periods of time and then it turns their skin green underneath the same effect is happening this is what's happening in the water there and once I'd seen that I knew we'd found the source of the malachite azurite.
Soil samples were collected from the murder scene in the area where police noticed the circular tire tracks next to low water bridge if we think the suspect came in one direction left in a different way we take samples along those tracks because again the social change the samples from the parking area were analyzed in the same way as the soil samples from Lewis felt G..
In both samples with the same mineral components of Asher right and malachite.
Mr felt his vehicle was at the crime scene when the murder took place no question it stands but it's about it's not a hundred yards up the road her yards down the road down or whatever he puts his vehicle right there.
Dr John Kerr believes that the minerals from the quarry got into the Shenandoah river traveled a mile downstream and were washed ashore into the parking lot at low water bridge around the time of the murder.
He'S the man you know he's he's the No all tell all god of this and for forensic geology.
Now investigators had to prove who was in the G. on the night of the murders we're in the position of being able to convict the vehicle of the homicide but we were much weaker on food and actually pulled the trigger.
Julie Grundy center boyfriend Louis felt C. merged as the prime suspect in the double shooting at low water bridge.
Witnesses placed Julie grubs at her apartment around the time of the murder but someone using her cell phone call tie late then twenty two times in the hours leading up to the murder every time you push that send button you hit the tower and that information's being logged in and kept.
A check of cell tower records showed that Julie grubs cell phone use many different cell towers during those calls the cell phone started making phone calls at three thirty three PM on the twenty six today the murder and they were using Washington DC cell site towers around between the six to seven o'clock hour they roll over in the Fredericksburg towers and then ultimately in the Winchester towers which is straight down from Fairfax so we're actually able to show that that cellphone traveled west on on fifty and ended up in the sand or valid that nine was used.
And investigators discovered that several local residents solved it was felt in a nearby convenience store earlier that day in addition.
Hi Layton step mother was with Ty about two hours before the merger when he received a cell phone call early said Lois dammit I told you I'll meet you at near light and slammed the finding.
Fells consistently denied being in Warren County for a number years prior to the murder.
It'S so it's vital to our case to be able to put him here in Warren County put him near the crime scene and we're able to do that through the cell phone records.
And investigators discovered even more forensic evidence.
Mike Kennedy a friend of Louis Stokes came forward with the startling revelation that he had sold felt's a shotgun three weeks before the murder.
Kennedy also said he had several spent shells from that shot gun still in his possession they might never believe me or whatever but I told them that I fired the gun they won no where.
Investigators recovered nine shell casings in Kennedy's yard.
When a shot gun fires the firing pin leaves a distinctive mark on the shelves.
I like to refer to is a fingerprint of the firearm this impression on the back of the shop showcase.
Firearms expert Jane Mason compared the shell casings from Michael Kennedy to the shells found at the crime scene.
He saw double horizontal lines with the slash on all of the samples.
The fact that I was able to identify the shot showcases all having been fired from the same farm with the the murder weapon in the hands of the suspect.
Prosecutors believe the motive for the shooting may have been old fashioned jealousy the classic love triangle there's some evidence that there was jealousy that had developed by felt it was suspicious that tie had been with his girlfriend.
The forensic evidence shows that Lewis felt cold high late then while driving towards front royal and asked him to meet at low water bridge.
There he saw tie late then and Joe Kovaleski parked and waiting.
And moving Kovaleski the trajectory analysis shows that fired from his G..
Two shell casings fell to the ground.
As felt's drove away the minerals malachite and azurite lodged in his wheel wells giving investigators a precise geological record of his location.
When felt saw the amount of forensic evidence against him he accepted a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to one count of capital murder one count of attempted murder.
Phelps was sentenced to twenty five years in prison I think our case show that lose files.
Is a heartless killer and deserved every minute behind bars and.
Prosecutors say there is no evidence to suggest that Julie Grubbs was involved in the shooting.
Joe Coveleski is blind in his right hi and has limited use of his right arm.
Kevin can see the sheriff's deputy implicated in drug dealing was later convicted of distribution of crack cocaine and sentenced to fourteen months in prison there was no evidence he was involved in life and smarter let me tell you something I'll be the first man of Kinsey had anything to do with the death of Thai relates and he'd be in jail for right this second I can guarantee you that the science and technology really came into play in this case and in a tremendous way we could not complete this prosecution without it your witnesses will change your story victims will change story there's just too many other.
things that can change put your physical evidence never change never change and to me that's one of the key things physical evidence tells it like it is.
