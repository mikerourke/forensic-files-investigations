It was supposed to be a routine motorcade for the queen of England but along this two lane highway leading to Yosemite National Park a car carrying secret service agents collided with another killing three people.
What went wrong who was responsible get in in this photograph was the clue to the mystery.
In nineteen eighty three Yosemite National Park in California was selected to be the site of a royal visit by the heads of the British monarchy.
We know little but the second and prince Philip was scheduled to tour the park following a visit with president Reagan and his California home.
Don Schneider a photographer and a reporter for a local radio station monitored the preparations for her arrival on the shortwave radio.
In advance of that there were three carloads of secret service agents that were going to use somebody to provide security at that location for they were not directly involved in her transport we were supposed to be preceding her and and have things ready up there in the in the park.
Four cars carrying secret service agents traveled along highway one thirty two a two lane road snaked its way through the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.
There were three agents in the second car the driver was George labarge forty one years old he was married with a young son.
George will barge with a fourteen year veteran of the secret service from Dayton Ohio he had been for many years assigned to the protection detail of the vice presidents as the three agents made their way eastward toward Yosemite deputy sheriff Ron St Clair of the Mariposa county sheriff's office was preparing to check the road closings for the queen's visit.
Rod was a a big man heavy and was quite macho and authoritative we had heard but we never Disini hard evidence of this fact that Sinclair was something of a loose cannon.
Sinclair and another deputy climbed into a Chevy impala patrol car similar to this one and sped west on highway one thirty two to check on the road closings.
At the same moment the secret service agents continued eastward in a small rental car.
None of the agents was wearing a seat belt the road was wet from a light rain.
Both Sinclair and the convoy of secret service agents believe the road had been cleared of traffic.
The sheriff's car was coming from our right around this curve the secret service cars are coming from R. left the road curved around a small hill that blocked the driver's view of approaching cars that location had been the scene of seven accidents in the previous three years.
At ten thirty one AM on March fifth it happened again the two cars entered the curve at the exact same.
The three agents were killed instantly.
Acted by seat belts the two deputy suffered only minor injuries.
It appeared to be a terrible but unavoidable tragedy.
The answer lay in the scarred surface of the roadway and the twisted metal of the wrecked cars.
Car with three secret service agents and a sheriff's patrol car with two deputies collided along the back road near Yosemite National Park.
The collision demolished both cars and claimed the lives of three secret service agents.
S. jin facing investigators was why.
Within two hours a special unit of the Fresno California highway patrol called the multi disciplinary accident investigation team or mate arrived at the scene.
Their job is to take a look at everything that's there.
Documented classify it photograph it and then I have use it later in the reconstruction process to develop a model as to how the vehicles were moving you want to know what the damage patterns are where's the contact damage where sandy's damage what is the nature of the damage how does that relate to objects or other vehicles are other people are anything else the vehicle may have come in contact with the investigators found the point of impact mark by scattered debris a pool of brake fluid and more than a dozen gouging scrape marks.
They also found a set of skid marks sixty four feet long.
They began in Sargent St Claire's lane across the yellow center line and ended in the oncoming lane traveled by the secret service.
It was clear the skid marks would be a critical clue.
They photographed the roadway in detail that was their first job and they need to do that before it was lost before the road we could be open.
The maid investigators then interviewed eyewitnesses one of whom was driving behind the secret service cars according to her the agents and did nothing wrong they were relaxed taking their time driving along at a reasonable speed for the for the area and the train.
After gathering all the evidence the maid investigators began the hard work of reconstructing what caused the accident what I'm doing here is called motion analysis I'm using the scale physical evidence and the scale vehicles to try to determine how the vehicles were moving during particular faces of the collision the motion analysis provided the data for a series of critical calculations the first was the momentum of each car immediately after the collision.
Omentum is determined by multiplying each car speed by its weight.
According to the laws of physics when objects collide as in this demonstration their momentum after the impact is equal to that before if the investigators could figure out the speed of the two cars as they separated immediately after impact they could calculate how fast they were going before the crash.
The investigators near the weights of both cars by measuring the distance and direction they had slid their rotation and the amount of friction they were able to calculate their post impact speeds thirty miles per hour for the sheriff's car twenty four miles per hour for the secret service.
Next they looked at the angle at which the two cars had collided the angle of impact in this particular collision evaluation I was critical to determining how the solution to quash.
Make calculated that the two cars collided at a ten degree angle almost directly head on they already knew the direction the sheriff was traveling from the skid marks so the angle of impact allow them to calculate the path of the secret service call.
Ten degree approach angle between these two vehicles places the secret service Dodge Aries within its lane of travel and moving slightly from left to right but as a potential evasive tactics S. impact takes place I witness testimony had already established that the secret service agents were driving it around thirty five miles per hour the critical question was how fast was deputy send clear driving.
St Clair claimed he was going fifty five or sixty miles per hour.
Line the laws of conservation of momentum make calculated he was actually doing seventy six miles per hour.
When he came into that curve his vehicle was was out of position for the speed he was traveling when he saw off traffic coming out even in the eastbound direction he simply didn't have enough distance are enough time to safely negotiate the curve he panicked locked up the brakes on the patrol car once she did that the patrol car slide straight across the inside of the curve into the opposing traffic lanes and struck the second secret service vehicle.
Based on its three week investigation the California highway patrol believed that sergeant St Clair was grossly negligent and recommended that he be criminally prosecuted I believe the facts were there given the circumstances that you could make a case for misdemeanor manslaughter one man had lingering doubts about the investigation.
Attorney Charles Braun who represented broad St Clair believed something vital might have been missed.
kept saying over and over again there were in my laser traveler headed right at me there was nothing I could do but to hit the brakes was deputy St Clair telling the truth.
One hired his own investigators to find out and what they would discover would force the highway patrol to re opening their investigation.
Three secret service agents have been killed in the near head on collision with a sheriff's patrol car all the evidence indicated the deputy sheriff rod Sinclair was solely to blame.
In a local photographer don Schneider was looking at slides of the accident when he discovered a clue the highway patrol had missed another skip mark.
It was a surprise to me to see the mark there because I have not observed a skid mark at the accident site.
And I asked the question of the group that was there Hey follows what is this and pointed to the skid marks that I saw on the screen and it was obvious in the matter of discussion a few moments later that this had something to do with the secret service guard.
Attorney Charles Braun showed the things get mark to a team of accident reconstruction experts from the angle of the mark.
Eared but the secret service car had been over the center line and was turning back into its own lane when it was hit.
And all of a sudden.
I thought to myself.
We have because here for optimism.
The sergeant simpler it would seem is vindicated he said they were coming right out of them.
The new evidence suggested St Clair had hit the brakes not because he was going too fast as the highway patrol contended but because he saw danger ahead.
The California highway patrol investigators dismissed the new evidence calling it the phantoms skid mark the CHP experts.
Covered that ground on their hands and knees literally inch by inch and never saw that skid marks why they didn't find it wasn't clear but the discovery gave new impetus to bronze team of forensic accident reconstruction experts.
All K. fits a photographer and engineer is an expert in something called photogrammetry it's a six dollar word for making measurements from photographs or using photographs to make measurements.
Bruns experts needed a map of the accident scene with the skid marks to conduct their investigation.
K. for its job was to reproduce the mark on the road in its exact position so that a surveyor could map its location.
He began by making a thirty five millimeter negative of Schneider's photographs showing the skid mark I put it in to a special camera that I take back to the scene I locate the exact point from which he took his photograph and then looking through my camera hi can remarks the position of the skid mark on the ground and have a survey a record in the chalk marks help K. fix verify that the marquee recreated was exactly as it appeared in the photo.
Once the new survey map was created Dr William Bligh an expert in applied mechanics and accident reconstruction was able to trace the path of the secret service car the results confirmed send clear statement that the secret service cars were over the center line yeah I think that the out of the vehicle over the center line as I recall was something the neighborhood of one third to one half of the vehicle wasn't fully in the oncoming line.
Highway patrol had determined that the collision was virtually had on.
The live show that the sheriff's car had struck at an angle as if agent Boulevard have been turning to the right to get back into his own land.
Dr Blyden determined that the critical skid mark was made by one of the front tires on the agent's car.
Did have dark edges to it which is indicative of a front tire when you apply your brakes the weight of the car shifts to the front axle and when that happens the front tires tend to cut a little bit and the lotus on the edges of the tires on the sidewalls of the tyres primarily.
Article question was which front tire.
The highway patrol experts after first denying the existence of the skid marks argued it was made by the left.
If they were correct it meant the secret service could not have been over the center line.
Using photogrammetry case which was able to determine the width of the tire that made the skid mark and prove that it was in fact the right tire.
As it happened the right front tire on the record labarge car was almost an inch narrower than the other three tires in admin replaced probably buy a spare tire at some point and that particular tire marks matched only that number or right front tire.
Proving the skid marks belong to the secret service car was one of two critical issues facing Dr blights what was that sure of reacting to when he applied his brakes was he reacting to his perception that he was going too fast to make the corner or was he reacting to some other danger that he saw the highway patrol found Sinclair was going too fast.
Dr Blyth ran his own test using a patrol car identical to the one St Clair was driving the range for this sure Smith what I found was between sixty two and sixty six miles an hour.
At that speed sergeants and Claire had no reason to hit his brakes because he could have comfortably in negotiated the curve that left only one explanation we felt there was negligence on the part of the drivers of the first two cars and that motorists.
In that they crossed the center line okay let's begin a test run to help improve these findings run ask Paul K. fits to conduct a visibility study like this one recreating what each driver saw an instant before the collision.
The results would reveal another surprising piece of evidence.
Hi speed collision three secret service agents killed California highway patrol investigators determined that sheriff's deputy rod St Clair was solely responsible but then the discovery of a skid mark in this photograph suggested the secret service was also at fault.
The problem was proving.
To reconstruct the critical moments before deputy St Clair slammed on his brakes attorney Brian asked pulled K. fixed to conduct a visibility study.
What we were trying to find out is did that skid and alternate lost control on start because he perceived that the oncoming lead car was in his late.
If it's mounted cameras in vehicles identical to those involved in the accident positioning them to record each driver's point of view.
Then based on the physical evidence and the calculations of doctor blights he reconstructed the events that preceded the fatal collision.
From this point you can actually see that the lead car is halfway over the center line and the labarge car in front of this car is also a couple of feet over the center line.
Now comes the view from the fourth car driven by a key I witnessed Mona Crocker told made investigators she had seen the accident happened.
She testified that at no time did she see any of the three secret service cars crossed the center line she also testified that she saw the accident occur.
Jeff it's re enactment told a different story hello this is Mona Crocker's viewpoint and what's important here is that although the lead car ahead of her those halfway over the center line straddles the centre line from her viewpoint that is never visible because it's around the curve and over the hill.
Trucker thought she could see the position of the cars.
In fact she could not.
I was actually surprised at that the the results are about what Mona Crocker could or couldn't say I hadn't predicted or expected that from the beginning the critical question in the case was always why did deputy St Clair jam on his brakes K. for its dramatic reenactment answered the question.
Now from Sinclair's three point we can say that he sees the lead secret service car straddling the center line just a bit more than a second before he begins to skin in a straight line across the highway.
Based on the case it's powerful reenactment and the work of bronze team of investigators a judge ruled that the secret service agents were partially responsible for the acts.
He also ruled that the United States should reimburse Mariposa county thirty percent of a four million dollar settlement that had been paid to the families of the secret service agents killed in the accident I felt good.
The judge believed sergeants and player.
The secret service agents had driven across the center line and felt very good about that.
The verdict was later overturned on a technicality.
But brown and his team of forensic experts had proven their case.
Is phenomenal it is amazing what they can put together.
I know they can reconstruct.
An accident and how they can make.
Little small pieces of evidence tell a story their satisfaction when when the pieces come together and in a case like this and and other similar cases.
That was a very powerful presentation and I recall having a lump in my throat when I watched it it was as if you were in the driver's seat watching your life come to an end in that split second it was a very powerful videotape.
