She worked behind the scenes in a television news.
But one day instead of covering the news.
This is a.
The crime scene told terrible tale.
But it would take DNA behavioral profile and the computer to solve the case.
In July nineteen ninety four twenty two year old hope Denise hall and her three year old son Robert lives in a suburb of Richmond Virginia in this apartment complex.
open just graduated from Virginia state university at the top of her class.
focus was journalist and she wanted to work in the highly competitive television news industry.
Her big break came at the NBC affiliate in Richmond.
She was very eager she was very focused she was very mature for her age hope really wanted to be an on air reporter and anchor at the time she was working for us she was editing tape and so she pretty much gather the material for the broadcast and put it together.
At age nine she was diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer.
After five years of treatment hope was George.
At the age of nineteen became pregnant while still in college she and the baby's father shared custody of their son but decided marriage within the state I think we realized that we needed a lot of growing up we we have to grow up in order to really take on that the whole responsibility of of marriage and I think that was the bottom line.
By all accounts hope was a devoted mother and a determined career woman.
That'S why on the afternoon of July eleventh nineteen ninety four co workers in the news room became alarmed when she did not report to work.
Calls to hope's home went unanswered.
We had a crew in the area so we sent them by to find out what might be going on at the dock on our door they went in and when I got there there was police tape set up around the apartment complex.
You can actually smell death if there's something that you can.
Imagine when you walked in you could see the blood on the door.
Was found dead on the bedroom floor she had been stabbed to death.
It was one of the worst crime scenes of a song because it was blood everywhere.
Apartment door had been locked and showed no sign of forced entry no valuables were missing.
It was a bloody handprint near the door but it was too smart for analysis.
Two knives are on the kitchen counter third knife lay on the bed a fourth was on the bathroom sink with water still running.
In the kitchen police found a broken blood stains drinking glass.
Dried blood droplets form the trail from the kitchen to the bedroom.
The phone was on the bedroom floor ripped from the wall.
As officers on the crime scene they realized one key item was conspicuously absent.
As police rushed to find the child and the killer.
Co workers rush to put our story on the air.
The young woman involved in producing the news was now a central figure in the day's top stories.
Investigators had to mysteries to solve who killed pope Paul and where was her three year old son.
Police contacted the baby's father Robert Kennedy I remember I was at home at my mom's house and I just walked in the door.
I'M I'm I told me that a detective that called.
He told police that their son young Robert was with him in northern Virginia about two hours drive away.
The child was spending the summer.
Police asked can a to come in for questioning my father wrote down with me I couldn't feel anything hi I.
I was in a zombie like state.
Police believe Toby knew her killer because her front door was found locked somebody had a key the only way they could have locked it did was to have a key on the outside and market we have to find this person no one can stop someone repeatedly and their phone three times and leave them to rot on the floor.
This crime was eerily similar to the ones committed by Richmond's southside strangler who raped and murdered five women in their homes.
That was the case then terrified absolutely terrified the community people were boarding up windows and just changing their life plans the southside strangler Timothy Spencer was executed for those crimes shortly before hopefuls merger.
Spencer'S case made history he was the first person put to death in the United States based on DNA evidence to the Spencer's case brought awareness to law enforcement certainly in this area too what DNA can do.
Spencer'S case prompted Virginia lawmakers to establish the country's first DNA data bank which put the DNA profiles of all convicted felons of Virginia's prisons into a computer.
So many felons have a tendency to commit crimes again once they are released from the from the system.
Scientists found unidentified.
The killers on the broken drinking glass in the kitchen.
The night on the bathroom sink also and the killers.
Rancic testing also found signs of sexual assault.
From the crime scene evidence forensic scientists performed a DQ alpha and polymarker DNA analysis.
Polymarker consisted of five different areas of the DNA DQ alpha was the sixth area of the DNA so these were just six areas of the DNA that we were looking out for differences between individuals.
No match so investigators looked elsewhere.
Most homicides are committed by people where there is some level of relationship they can be very close or can be not not very close at all.
Police spoke with the baby's father Robert canning he had an alibi he was at his home over a two hour drive away at the time of the merger.
Even with this alibi can he voluntarily submitted a blood sample for DNA testing.
I was more than happy to assist them in any way I can to you know intimidate me so that they can focus on whoever is responsible.
But his DNA did not match blood found at the crime scene so can you was cleared.
Knowing one thing and scientific data proving another is two different things my god said he did not do this.
Next investigators looked into hopes lifestyle for possible clues the new healthcare plan she was about her own safety I just couldn't believe that she would be anywhere where should be at risk.
We didn't see anything that indicated that she was out running around or anything else it would make a se maybe she ran into somebody in a bar or something like that she could have brought home.
But investigators found two potential witnesses.
Neighbors saw a man without a shirt running from hope's apartment building on the night of America.
They said he had a tattoo on his arm and chest which look like Greek symbols.
Omega sci fi was a local college fraternity.
Friends and co workers told police that this description sounded like a man hope recently dated of allegedly told friends the man got abusive when she tried to end their relationship.
The ex boyfriend's name was leroy quick.
Police discovered he had and I'll make a sign by two on his arm and chest.
Both witnesses identified quick in a police line up as the man they saw running from hope's apartment.
Police were convinced they had their killer.
But they were shocked when they got the results of DNA tests.
In the search for hope Paul's killer police turned their attention to hope's ex boyfriend twenty nine year old leroy quick.
Witnesses claimed they saw him running from hope's apartment building on the night of the murder.
Police made a break in this case just before sunrise around six AM they arrested twenty nine year old leroy the quake the third all of us were surprised because it was someone that she had not even mentioned to us.
Coworkers told police the couple next summer.
Quick denied having a key to hopes the park.
He denied being at hope's apartment the night of her murder and he denied any involvement in the crime it was a roller coaster you felt that everything was about to come to an end about to find out exactly what happened.
That was the case.
Investigators were dumbfounded when they heard that leroy quick's DNA did not match the crime scene evidence I was somewhat surprised we have the witnesses that identified him coming out of the apartment.
Without a shirt on.
Jump in a car.
Police re interviewed hundreds of hopes neighbors friends and family to see if any clue in mass.
Nothing at all.
And believe me when I say we interviewed a lot of people.
I think I can go on record to say we practically into do everybody in the house the manor apartments.
Now nearly a year after her murder.
Hope'S parents refuse to give.
They maintained constant contact with police and wrote to dozens of lawmakers pleading for help in finding their daughter's killer.
Not just because of.
It'S very frustrating for everyone it was very heartbreaking for her mother and we saw the anguish that her mother was going through as she tried to find an answer to after hearing the two most obvious suspects forensic scientists performed a second more discriminating D. N. A. test of the killer's DNA using R. F. L. P. restriction fragment length polymorphism.
At the time RFLP was the most discriminating DNA test available.
RFLP measured various sections of the killer's DNA to determine the lengths unique to that individual.
Means that there is a much better chance of telling my DNA apart from yours.
This newer more complete DNA profile holes killer was once again entered into the Virginia DNA databank.
The computer compares the unidentified DNA profile to the DNA eight thousand convicted felons I've been working on it for a long time so to become like my case nope all the cases and worked on this was the one that I really wanted to get a hit on.
Two years earlier there had been no match but this time was different.
The blood and semen evidence in hopefuls apartment matched that of Jermaine Johnson.
His DNA profile was put into the database because of his recent conviction for two other rapes.
Johnson lived in hope Paul's apartment complex and was just sixteen years old at the time of her murder it was a big eye opener for me I always thought criminals said scores and and looked like criminals this guy did not look at all like a criminal.
This data banks first.
In a homicide case.
An innocent things like Jermaine Johnson you would think someone that innocent looking young would not have committed this type of crime that he did.
Investigators thought they finally had the break they desperately needed.
But if your main Johnson was hopes killer why had witnesses identified hopes ex boyfriend as the man running from hope's apartment.
Johnson'S DNA was in Virginia's database because of two convictions for rape cyber strikingly similar to hopefuls case.
When questioned by police Johnson claimed he was innocent.
He admitted knocking on hope's apartment door and asking her for a drink of water.
But Johnson said another man opened the front door with the key he pulled out a knife and ordered Johnson to lead this was consistent with the eye witnesses who saw not sure main Johnson but another man running from hope's apartment later that same night.
Was it possible Charmaine Johnson wasn't the killer.
Investigators asked FBI behavioral profiler mark separate to compare Johnson's past criminal behavior to the whole Paul case.
Hey Missy relatively criminally unsophisticated yes that's not uncommon with younger offenders but.
My job wasn't to look at your main I wasn't asked to look at for me I wasn't even asked to consider the offender was simply asked to look at behavior.
He also examined photos and reports from the national rates Johnson was suspected of committing.
Stafford found many behavioral links in all five crimes.
All of the victims were young and live close to trimming Johnson's home.
There is a dynamic that connects all of them contrary to many sexual assaults where the offender assault contacts and captures an assault victim all in the same area here we have a guy who wants to capture and then subsequently move all of his victims to another location to engage in the sexual assault.
In each case Johnson used some kind of rules to gain entrance to the victim's home.
And once inside threatened the victims with one of their own kitchen knives when he has the option for lots of different knives even larger more threatening knives butcher knives longer bladed knives he he chooses a shorter bladed knife he's more comfortable with that type of weapon.
Prosecutors were now convinced that Johnson went to hope's apartment that night asking for a drink of water yeah.
Once in the last bill to the floor Johnson grabbed a knife.
Johnson returned to the kitchen numerous times for other nights after each was damaged.
At some point he picked up the broken pieces of glass cutting his finger and leaving his own DNA behind.
After the murder the evidence shows Johnson washed his hands in the bathroom sink but he did all his own.
He was trying to clean up he may have been injured maybe that's why the water was left running in the bathroom or it may have just been that he was just trying to clean the knife digesting cleanup.
One nagging question remains if the witnesses were correct in their identification why was leroy quick running from hope's apartment that night.
Prosecutors don't believe creek had anything to do with the murder.
But there is speculation that quick may have gone to hope's apartment that night use the key to get in and found dead then fled fearing he would be blamed and the lock the apartment door behind him.
Click however denies this.
Regardless Jermaine Johnson was tried and convicted of hope Paul's murder and this time was sentenced to death.
The three the guy is an animal I don't know whether I won't push the needle but I certainly would like to witness.
if nobody else would do it I would certainly do it.
Investigators say it was a confluence of DNA evidence computer technology and the foresight to collect and catalog the DNA profiles of all convicted felons that brought Jermaine Johnson to justice we interviewed everybody in that apartment complex and Charmaine Johnson's name never came up without the DNA data bank without that forensic evidence.
Hi unfortunately I would say that this case would not have been saw we're trying to push in the national database we feel very very strongly that Kronos doesn't stay put they move from city to city state to state countries the countries and we want to make sure that they clear messages sent out that no matter where you go no matter what you think you've gotten away with your DNA and law enforcement the wait for.
