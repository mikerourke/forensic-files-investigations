A teenage girl in Australia was found dead on the side of a road.
Her boyfriend became the prime suspect eventually he confessed to her murder but so did another may.
Who was telling the truth.
It took forty years a writer and the pedestrian crash reconstruction is to finally uncovered the truth.
The city of Perth sits on the western coast of the vast continent of Australia it's a modern example of the industrious but laid back Aussie lifestyle.
Where beaches barbecuing and sport are critically important.
in nineteen sixty three the city was smaller but not that different.
It'S been a sleepy little hollow just a beautiful little town way you never thought of any sort of crime will move up very innocent very secure.
At that time John Barton was a teenager in love with seventeen year old rose merry Anderson.
On jun nineteenth birthday rose merry stopped over at John's house to celebrate John's little brother was also there.
The three teams spent the night watching television.
Well eating the fish and chips John watching TV sore hand come across fifty species of fish yelled at the person thinking was his little brother but it was rice me.
She got upset she stormed off and said that was I thought she was working on.
Button said he got into his car and drove along side her apologizing and trying to convince her to get into the car so he could drive her home.
She done that once before and after he stopped for a little while and after five minute walk on her own she cool down he thought she would do that again.
So he watched as rose merry walked under a railway overpass and around the corner.
John claimed he drove after rose merry and found her face down on the side of the road unconscious bruised and bleeding.
Dr Alistair Turner treated rose merry that night.
The blood pressure was very unstable going up and down issues missing blood into Donald incidents on.
So really I don't think she had any chance of survival.
When the police arrived they noticed a dent on the front of John's car.
And they also noticed fresh blood.
Eventually but confessed to hitting his girlfriend with this car.
It is written confession he admitted the couple's argument was over something more than a piece of fish.
When Rosemary refused to get in the car but he said he got angry and tried to scare her so he sped towards her intending to stop but lost control of the car and inadvertently hit.
Prosecutors had all they needed for a conviction.
Just a few hours after he confessed to killing his girlfriend with this car.
John button recanted.
He now said his confession was coerced and the police hit him during the interrogation I think was a bit full as a questioning that I I received a quick punch to the stomach.
Set the back in the chair again and I realized at that point that they were going to let me out of here until I got a confession and and.
But he said the body damage on his car happened a few weeks earlier and that Rosemary's blood dripped onto the front bumper when he picked her up to take her to the hospital.
Trevor Condren examined the car at the request of the local police.
If this had struck a petition would've expected to fall and damage to the bonus like such as Denton bonnet.
But John Burton went on trial for murder and his earlier confession made it an open and shut case.
The jury deliberated for six hours before returning to the court room with their verdict.
Members of the jury how do you find the accused guilty or not guilty not guilty your honor.
Sorry your honor I made a mistake.
We find him guilty.
In order for a comment John Barton's life had been spared but he was sentenced to ten years of hard labor in Fremantle prison.
The police succeeded in the jury thinking he was a terrible young man trying to have sex with that beautiful young girl I've heard it said that sports the foreman of the jury said hang the bastard trying to have sex with a beautiful young girl why did I sign a confession why did they force me into it why why do we have that argument with my girlfriend.
Fremantle prison was a relic from Victorian times with no plumbing heating or air conditioning.
Seven months later another man arrived at Fremantle prison to await his execution.
Eric Edgar Cooke had been convicted of killing a young man in cold blood.
He had also confessed to other acts of random violence confessed to item it is and about twelve home invasions in which women were attacked in the bids.
But that wasn't all incredibly cook also said that he was the one who killed Rosemary Anderson.
Cook said he intentionally ran her down when she was walking on the side of the road.
It was an answer to his prayers.
For the first time but recalled seeing cook's car passed him when he was looking for rose merry that night what I didn't realize at that very moment as it's turned out driving past on the other side about like on that mine was a big coke.
But there were problems with cooks confession.
Police took to the scene of rose merry Anderson's murder and asked him to identify where the incident took place.
Pointed to the wrong spot.
Police didn't believe cook story so the court denied John Buchan's appeals.
To hold until the day it disappeared along with the birds gathered on the roof of the prison gallows.
I knew that once it was hand that was the end of any time so I had a bit of being released.
The minister attending cooks execution said cook took the Bible from his hands and again confessed to Rosemary's merger.
But it was of no help to John but.
It would take years before he'd get another chance to prove his innocence.
After serving five years of a ten year sentence John button was released from prison for good behavior.
The first thing he did was visit rose merry Anderson's gray.
He was out of prison physically but not out of prison emotionally he lived his life with a big sign over his head convicted killer and a big rocking is hot in justice.
But eventually got married had two children found a job and battled a serious depression.
Seven years after I was released I did do something foolish.
In desperation button took an overdose of sleeping pills got into his car and drove off a steep embankment at a hundred miles an hour.
Miraculously he survived from that point on my life changed completely.
A couple things that I asked of these.
He wrote the government officials looking for a way to clear his name with no luck.
He even tried writing a book but no publisher would touch it I remember standing there with the rejection slip in my hand and I raised my hands up I said god if you want this book with me but it is something the fine thank.
The call was about a Stella Blackburn a journalist and the former government press secretary she was intrigued by the case and agreed to help investigate button story.
I had the skills and the door was it was slammed shut in his face I've been to me I had the networks and the contacts I could get the files and everything that he needed on you how to research I was playing a detective I was investigating a six year old moda trying to find fresh evidence.
Blackburn wasn't entirely convinced that button was innocent she had serious doubts about Eric Cooke's credibility.
Well I lived through the cookie I knew cook didn't run down girls cook shop people and later we learned that he stabbed and strangled as well they said they didn't run down girls but in the files of buttons nineteen sixty four appeals still found something surprising something that had not been widely reported thirty years earlier.
Six women had survived a hit and run car crashes and Eric Cooke had confessed to being the driver in each of them.
Each woman's story was eerily similar to Rosemary's.
Young women on dark isolated run down by a stolen car.
The still eventually wrote her own book about John Barton's case and she too had problems finding a publisher.
That is until she asked her friend a local newspaper publisher for help.
When Britain Christian read the manuscript he agreed to personally financed the publication of Blackburn's book having met John I realized it was just not possible for him to have done it and I didn't same the physics didn't seem right to me the.
Christian also questioned the lack of damage to the front of his car.
The place was on the side that joins a lot right fringe fringe Simcha and hit go hot enough to kill her and yet that was on the there's really no discernible damage on it didn't add up submitted that.
What could science backed off his suspicions the answer to that question would come from the world's smartest crash test dummy.
Still convinced many that John button was innocent and that serial killer Eric Cooke was the one who killed rose merry Anderson.
His only hope of overturning the verdict was to find new or fresh evidence in this thirty seven year old case.
Fresh evidence and Lauren this jurisdiction is evidence which was not a viable at the time of the trial which obviously didn't feature at the time of the trial and which could not with reasonable diligence have nine available.
Publisher Brett Christian believe so strongly in buttons in a sense that he searched all over the world for an expert in the new field of forensics called pedestrian crash reconstruction.
In Texas he found rusty hate a former policeman and one of the most respected crash reconstruction is to in the field accident reconstruction is an effort to explain how a crash a car crash happened we use a lot of common sense some elementary applied physics and more common sense and try to piece together the objective information we have for a given car crash to make some sense of it to sort out.
How things happened.
When he first looked at photographs taken of John button's car after the accident he didn't believe there was damage consistent with the fatal collision Rosemary Anderson the girl that was hit by a car was hit in the in the range of thirty to forty miles an hour and that leaves you know that kind of contact with a body leaves distinctive marks on our car and there were none of those marks on the car that I saw photos nothing even close.
The market could be on the hook because of the way a body moves when hit at that speed I think you can envision you know person as a struck by a car basically wrapping or or or bending onto the up to from the car the technical term we use when we're describing the trajectory is a rap trajectory where the force applied on the body is below the body center mass so the body's going to be and usually about the waste and that's gonna leave some sort of mark on the hood.
But in an appeals court it would need more than just an opinion he would need hard forensic proof.
For that he needed to perform pedestrian crash test on the nineteen sixty three Simcoe brand car model by this time was thirty five years old.
Despite the age.
He also found a nineteen sixty three hold the model Eric Cooke said he was driving when he killed rose merry Anderson cooks version is that he drives up behind her and hits her from behind.
A bio medical dummy was used to mimic the reactions of Rosemary's body.
Eight suspended by a fishing line that breaks on impact.
The police didn't accept Eric Cooke's version of the crash because the exterior sun visor on his car wasn't damaged as one would expect.
When hates test car struck the dummy from behind it rolled onto the hood and over the roof justice Eric Cooke had claimed but I was focused on the visor I was focused on the alignment and then I looked at the visor and and I remember seeing the visor band when the dummy hit it and it's cynical chilled my back at that.
This is not good it can be good.
The visor head snapped back into shape with no damage.
This explains why Eric Cooke's visor showed no damage when police inspected.
They actually flex that's what this this visor down when the body hit so now all of a sudden what was kind of a tense moment became Hey we've done it to the dummy did exactly what crooks said it was just a moment of while this is it we've done it.
And the dummy landed face down consistent with how John button found Rosemary's body.
The test on John button's car the Simcha were even more persuasive.
We found marking at the leading edge of the hood and more importantly found a big dent big depression in the hood where the dummy it come down and basically smacked his head on the hood.
Whether we headed in the right more in the center on the left it just didn't matter.
There was no similar damage to buttons car and each time the dummy landed on its back inconsistent with the injuries on the front of Rosemary's body.
Rusty hate concluded that John Barton did not kill Rosemary Anderson.
So with the stills research and with with heights evidence we were able to show both of those things hi it must have been cool and but he could not abide by.
This was enough to convince three judges on the Supreme Court of Western Australia but the verdict must be regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory on the ground there has been a miscarriage of justice.
We went back and corrected the wrong and we did it with an appropriate use of of of the forensic evidence but also a liberal use of good investigative techniques that didn't come from the police they came from basically lay people I think it makes us a little bit more aware of the fallibility of the system and have a little bit more face it can be rectified and that it is possible it's the advance of someone's the timing just billion nine possible in the recognition of that branch of science studies motor vehicle crash reconstruction that I would cite beyond any doubt that the CEO of success when John burns cuts.
