Home made bomb ripped through a room.
Investigators had no idea who was responsible the device was made with common items found in the store but a tiny battery number and the label inside a computer uncovered a bizarre tale of revenge.
The tiny town of fair haven Vermont is about as far removed from big city life is any place in the country.
Violence was virtually unheard of but even so locals used to joke that Sheila Rockwell and her seventeen year old son Chris mark he lived in the safest place in town about a hundred feet away from the police station.
But all of that changed one March afternoon in nineteen ninety eight.
There was a knock on the door it was the UPS man.
And I look at the package in the package it said.
Samantha brown on it.
Well it didn't ring a bell to me because I don't know who any Samantha brown was so I brought it into Chris.
Chris was sitting at his desk in his bedroom and he didn't know Samantha brown easier.
He opened the box inside is a smaller box wrapped with string.
The string and there was an explosion.
And I didn't realize that I was hit because my fingers were gone.
I tried crawling to Chris because he was moaning.
And that's when I realized that my knee wasn't there.
And then I couldn't get to him.
Chief ray vigor heard the explosion and ran over to investigate lockdown actual quarter to into the living room and then we could see.
Shiva and Chris were rushed to the hospital.
A large piece of the shrapnel in this case went towards Christopher marquees leg essentially blew a large hole in his side and severed his femoral artery anti blood to death I kept asking where where is Chris where is Chris how is Chris doing in Dr apartment came in and.
And I can remember just let out a scream and then they add you know put me under.
It was a pipe bomb the favorite device of amateur bomb.
Tiny brass hex nuts had been wrapped around the bomb to make it even more deadly.
To terrible circumstance of violent crime that somebody just.
Hooks up with the wrong person at the wrong time and becomes the victim of this kind of outrageous activity.
The return address on the package said Samantha brown.
From the Cyrus Ohio.
When police checked the name and address they found both were fictitious.
Chris Markey was a seventeen year old high school dropout a loner because of an eye condition he was slowly going blind he spent most of his time indoors and he had few friends.
Yet someone clearly wanted to kill him.
But as police looked into his background they found Chris had a Secret Life something his family knew nothing about.
As police combed through the wreckage of Chris marquees bedroom they had one question who wanted him dead.
The package was shipped from Ohio and was addressed to the C. B. shack in care of Chris Markey.
It is a small business Chris ran out of his home selling citizen band radios and parts through the internet.
Well wasn't really a.
It was mainly local people.
You know friends of his that he would fix their radio or people would hear him on the radio probably bragging and telling him how he could fix radios you know and it was pretty much locals.
But investigators soon discovered that Chris Markey didn't always treat his customers fairly I think it's fair to say that.
Christopher marquis was not completely honest in all of its business dealings with other people prior to his.
Which marquee made enemies by not living up to the agreement that he had made with individuals purchasing and selling of C. B. shuts another various equipment.
Customers told police that Chris would promise to send one model of CB radio but after he received payment would ship another lower priced radio.
Obviously number these individuals were upset over this and therefore it was necessary for the investigation to locate and interview these individuals in order to determine if that anger rose to the level where they would do such a.
I'M crying with hundreds of customers investigators now had hundreds of suspects.
Investigators discovered that the package was shipped by the United parcel service from Mansfield Ohio.
The name and town on the return address were both fictitious.
The crime scene investigators sifted through the debris looking for evidence.
Extensive search was required we are meticulously going through every room where any piece of evidence that we're looking for a wire a tool a hex nuts we're taking sweepings.
And going room to room.
Bomb experts say bombs are unique to each bomber has a signature style.
And the bomb that killed Chris Markey at the signature all that song.
One of the things that we knew from the murder scene was that small brass hex nuts had been included in the bomb that killed Chris Markey so the FBI agents in the search we're looking for hex nuts that might be physically consistent with the hex nuts in the bomb.
Investigators also found pieces of styrofoam used to pack a bomb a piece of the battery used to detonate and they were able to identify the chemical make up of the gun powder used in the explosion.
But all of these items were available in any hardware store or gun shop.
The bombing death of Chris Markey made the national news.
The witness realized that he had information that was important to law enforcement was at that point the cooperating witness contacted law enforcement.
The informant told investigators that a long distance truck driver in Indiana Christopher dean had purchased a CB radio from someone through the internet and was angry about it this witness informed the FBI that he was present in a discussion with Mr dean.
When he spoke of his problems with the sale of a CB radio and a young man in Vermont there was information that he'd said he was going to come to Vermont and you know.
When questioned dean confirmed he had purchased a CB radio from Chris Markey for four hundred dollars and had been sent a cheaper model instead.
at one time his wife actually called Christopher marquis and indicated that her husband was quite upset and maybe traveling to Vermont and that he would not.
PM very happy if he did there was a lot of phone calls.
In a lot of times I would answer the phone any to ask for my son.
And Chris would say I'm not here you know he gave me the motion he didn't want to answer the phone call.
Sheila admitted her son didn't return dean's money.
But dean denied sending the box.
He had no prior criminal record and he lived in Indiana the package had been shipped from Ohio he was described as a very hard working person reliable honest very loving family.
It'S plenty of friends and neighbors who trusted him cool thought he was a generous regular guy.
Investigators wondered whether forensic evidence in dean's home would contradict his story.
They can't really believe that somebody would do this Chris was my pride and joy it was my youngest child.
They say that.
You have to forgive.
And because of my religion I believe I do have to forgive.
But I don't think I've come to that yet.
Armed with the warrant investigators searched Christopher dean's home their prime suspect in the bombing death of Chris Markey.
We are looking everywhere that any place a hex nut could be a wooden clothes pin some tax batteries any type of insulating materials as well as taking sweeping carpet looking for powders anything that may have held any type of explosive powers interested for dean's basement they found hex not similar to those used in the fatal Bon.
To find out if they were the same analysts used a process known as plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.
They took samples from the hex nuts found with the bomb.
And those found in the house.
These samples were dissolved in a neutral chemical solution which was an favourites at extremely high temperatures.
Different components like saying can copper will vaporize at different speeds all of which is monitored by a computer.
Investigators concluded the hex nuts at the same chemical make up.
Identical hex nuts from a metallurgical point of view were recovered from Mr dean's residence they were stored in a container there is work bench where we allege the bomb is constructed in the rest of the house was even more evidence investigators found the same type of wiring used in the bombs detonated they found the same type of pipe used in the fatal bond in the same type of styrofoam packing material was discovered in dean's garage.
This pipe bomb use smokeless powder one of the things we're looking for was however like that and we just thing enough there was no container of powder found.
But in the kitchen investigators found a small plastic funnel that looked like it might contain a clue.
The final could visibly see that there appeared to have been some type of powder used in the.
The powder was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope that uses X. rays to reveal its chemical components.
That sample was compared to the powder found at the bomb see.
Both samples were smokeless gun powder and both had a seventy percent concentration of nitro glycerin in addition to the stabilizing component nitro cellulose.
The smokeless powder matched the smokeless powder from the murder bomb and from the smokeless powder we found inside his house there was a problem.
All of these items in dean's home were available at stores in every state in the country there was nothing unique or unusual about the gun pod the plate or the hex nuts.
Investigators knew that sometimes the tiniest piece of evidence is the most telling so they returned to the bomb see.
Among the thousands of pieces of debris they found the mangled nine volt battery.
With a magnifying glass.
Investigators saw a series of numbers and letters on the side of the battery.
Three G. to four G. to five call to the manufacturer revealed this was a lot number that identified the day and the assembly line on which the battery was assembled.
Inside Christopher dean's home investigators found an open pack of the same brand of nine volt batteries with one missing.
The lot numbers on the unused batteries with the same as the one used to detonate the pipe.
And that lot number meant that those batteries were manufactured at the same day on the same line.
Just when prosecutors talk their case against dean would primarily be circumstantial a computer forensic experts found even more evidence inside Christine's computer it was the final team thought he had deleted one half.
Prosecutors found evidence that Christopher dean ordered the CB radio from Chris Markey and sent a check for four hundred dollars Markey sent a less expensive CB radio than the one dean ordered.
The motive for Mr dean's actions in this murder of Christopher marquis appears today unfortunately his extreme anger over the fact that Christopher marquis swindled him out of a four hundred dollar CB radio there was one last item in Christine's home investigators needed to evaluate.
A computer forensic analysis uncovered evidence that dean had recently downloaded information on how to build a pipe bomb if an investigator will looking for evidence of searches for pipe bomb material on the internet it is not difficult to locate especially if the computers themselves not savvy in how to cover his tracks.
And on the hard drive of his computer there was a copy or template of the labels used on the box that held the pipe bomb with the same fictitious return address that was found on the pipe bomb package.
Mr dean attempted to delete the files but remnants of the file we're still on the computer's hard drive.
They probably thought he covered his tracks insulated all files however because he printed it the computer generated the second file on the system for the printer and that is what was found to be remarkable.
For anybody else to have made up the exact name exact address.
That was contained on Christopher dean's computer.
I characterize this computer labeled as a computer fingerprint it was conclusive in my mind that somebody had the that this bomb was associated with that house.
that somebody had created the address label used in this bomb at the dean residents.
Christopher dean was arrested and charged with first degree murder.
Prosecutors had plenty of evidence to prove he chose violence as a way to resolve his dispute with Chris Markey.
In making the bombs dean on wittingly used a nine volt battery which identified the date and the factory in which it was manufactured a battery which matched the ones found in his home.
Logs from Mr dean's trucking company indicated he was in Mansfield Ohio on the day the fatal package was sent.
We even went a step further than that the witness at the UPS facility in Ohio identified Christopher dean is the person who shipped out box.
We were able to compare the hand writing on the UPS receipt with Mr dean's hand writing and inviting experts would say that it was the same person and dean had no idea he was dealing with the teenager.
They communicated over the internet and a little bit over the telephone so they'd never met each other Mr dean didn't know what Mister Markey look like didn't know he was a seventeen year old boy.
In February of two thousand Christopher dean pleaded guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
For Sheila Rockwell.
It was little satisfaction in the sentence.
She still bears the scars of the bomb that killed her son.
She limps from the shrapnel that tore through her leg and her hands will never recover from the blast.
But mostly she mourns the loss of her seventeen year old son.
Why would anybody ever do this over CB radio.
You know if only I had known.
I would try to you know reason with dean.
Whatever the case may be but it was just.
Unbelievable that somebody that crazy.
Would do something like that.
Sitting here today I still can't fathom.
How one person would be.
Of a mindset that just because they got ripped off for a couple hundred Bucks.
That they'd want to kill somebody that they've never seen before.
For investigators to case proves something that Christopher dean never thought possible.
He was convinced that since he's never been to Vermont and you've never met Chris Markey no one could tie him to the fatal bomb.
But he never realized forensic science would identify him.
The materials used to build the bomb the lot numbers on the batteries and the fictitious name and address that was recovered from his computer.
Left no doubt that he was the one who killed Chris Markey.
We had a lot of evidence in this case but the forensic evidence to me was the linchpin of the prosecution and we not only had one piece of forensic evidence but we had many many different kinds of friends again and it was just amazing the way that they had pinpointed the paper wrapper at the styrofoam.
Everything that he hit you know put in the mom the hex nuts all.
Right back to the manufacturer.
It was unbelievable that science was that good.
