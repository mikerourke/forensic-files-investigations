Shortly after daybreak in Vancouver British Columbia a fire was set to the contents of a garbage dumpster no one saw the arsonist or the fire as it burns for hours in the deserted parking lot.
But there was more than garbage in the band and it would take sophisticated science to identify the evidence in the ashes.
When Milton DM's walked towards the dumpster to empty some trash he noticed the bin was warm when he looked inside he noticed a small charge figure in the corner so badly burned it was beyond recognition I know something was burned and and and but he was not lost it wasn't and then more or less a person if it was a personal it was to.
I hope out of five you know what I can conceive that someone would do that to another human being in the charred remains were carefully removed and taken to the morgue where the gruesome and difficult task of identification would begin straight away we knew we wouldn't have fingerprints and we knew we wouldn't have the normal means to identify the victim because it is the condition of the body.
All that remained was the equivalent of thirty five pounds of charcoal like material.
It was an enormous challenge to Vancouver's medical examiner Dr laurel gray well obviously we didn't have a whole lot to work with we had no idea what the cause of death was whether it was related to the fire or some other matter during the autopsy doctor gray could not find any recognizable skin but did find a small patch of hair where the head pressed against the floor of the dumpster it appeared to be reddish blonde in color but the intense heat destroyed the hair follicles which could have been used for DNA testing.
X. rays of the victim's skull revealed several pieces of metal and a fractured skull evidence of gunshot wounds fragments recovered from the brain came from a twenty two caliber weapon.
But they were so badly damaged they could not be used for ballistic identification.
Police now knew that it was a homicide case the gunshots and caused obvious very severe damage to the brain they had fractured the many of the facial bones there was a lot of blood in the.
within the the facial bones in the sinuses the blood in the sinus cavities meant there was active circulation when the bullets enter the victim's brain indicating that the heart was beating when the shots were fired but the intense heat altered the victim's blood chemistry making it impossible for any kind of DNA analysis and examination of the victim salons showed no signs of smoke inhalation which meant that the victim was dead before the fire the internal organs revealed that the victim was an adult female.
To help with the identification investigators called in Dr Larry Cheevers he's a forensic odontology just who was asked to study the dental remains of the victim this was a victim of an inferno.
Absolutely I'm qualified in final there was virtually nothing left but when Dr Cheever's look closer he was surprised to see beneath the charred surface that the jawbone and teeth were intact because they're surrounded by barriers their saliva in the mouth the gases in the stomach expand and push the tongue out and they her muscles of the face become quite leathery and so the one thing that survives above all else is the T. by studying the growth patterns of the teeth and skull Dr Cheever's estimated that the victim was between twenty four and thirty years of age.
And when Dr Cheever's look closely at the X. rays he discovered an important clue the victim had an extremely rare dental condition called Museo de.
It'S an extra two which never grew into place on top of the two front teeth inside the gun the X. rays also showed a lot of high quality dental work when you start talking forty eight hours past the finding of the body and you don't have an idea who the suspect is in at that stage we didn't know who the victim was you start thinking no it's going to be.
A long haul it's going to be a difficult case Greg Middleton coverage the search for the identity of the victim and her killer for the province newspaper in Vancouver they told me at the time that they thought that there was no hope is all that there was they had so little to go on that they didn't think they were going to get anywhere police now had a horrific murder but still couldn't identify the victim for her murder.
When the police reviewed all the recent missing persons reports one in particular caught their eye it was for a thirty year old woman named Lynn breed.
She had blonde hair and was last seen on the day before the charred remains were discovered.
When the dental records for Lynn Breeden were compared to those from the charred remains doctors noticed the same xtratuf above the gum line on top of the front teeth and the dental work match the burn victim as well.
Dr Cheever's was convinced that Lynn breed.
What'S the person's burned in the fire those absolutely no doubt in my mind and the minute I saw them easier to ends there and then up to see the other title work and they all had it up to the fact that this was the same individual are the same unfortunate victim when Britain was a part time model who once posed for playboy magazine she worked here at a men's club called number five orange as a cocktail waitress a lot of her friends were able to tell us about your background and fortunately I think she'd gone the cocaine route the city of Vancouver and I think she was well involved in the use of cocaine Lynn Breeden was last seen late Friday night walking along Robson street in Vancouver police learned that Britain's former boyfriend lived on Robson street in this apartment building.
His name was Chris Baker.
D. was well known to police he was a local drug trafficker was certainly one of the last person is to be seen with her.
During police questioning.
A cook admitted he was with land grading from most of the night on the Friday in question.
He said she stopped by his apartment.
A few drinks talk for a while and ended up having sex.
Afterwards they went to celebrities night club and later was small after hours club.
He left the club without her and said that was the last he saw of her.
In that case it was a dead end yes.
He looked really good to begin with but when we confirmed he's alibi and he story yes it it turned out to be a dead end as far as that he was concerned detectives received an interesting tech from the manager of Lynn Britain's bank.
A woman had posed as Lynn Breeden attempting to withdraw all of the funds from her account I got up to the counter nine I asked to help her and she signed a withdrawal slip like for like four thousand dollars basically what Lynn had in her account and it wasn't security photograph showed the imposter looking out the window possibly an accomplice standing outside but glare from the sun hit the identity of whomever was outside the women left the bank quickly when her identity was questioned we went to our fraud squad and said do you know this person we did all those investigative things in case this was a chronic fraud suspect and somehow some way we could come up with a name through that Avenue of investigation.
That didn't give us an answer.
Police launched an all out effort to find the woman who posed as Lynn Bry.
It was their only lead to the merger.
The local newspaper published a photograph of the woman who posed as Lynn Britain at the bank and asked anyone who knew her to come forward within hours an anonymous tip identified the woman in the photograph as Tonya Forrester given the information we went to her.
Attempting to take the money from the the victim's account Tanya Forrester told police that she was given lend credence wallet and identification by a man named Chris Cruz who told her it was stolen together they agreed to clean out her bank account before it was reported missing she was on the way at the time that that was the victim of a homicide bank account Chris Cruz was an unusual character he was a model and actor a student at the university of British Columbia who was planning to attend medical school.
But Chris Cruz also went by the name of Tony dampens the stage name he used as a stripper and professional escort he reportedly had a healthy appetite for cocaine.
Cruz told police that he had been out on the night of Britain's merger first at the love affair nightclub and later at the same after hours club that lends reconnect her boyfriend Tristan.
Cruz said he only stayed for twenty minutes before leaving in a taxi cab to see your girlfriend.
The next day he said a friend offered him the contents of lens Britain's poorest telling Cruz it had been stolen we asked him can we search your car we said yes if we could.
We asked what kind of a car was and he gave us the description great Oldsmobile.
We asked them where it was and still is not running very well it's out at my grandmother's place in Surrey but crews did note that he had been under police surveillance they knew he had driven his car to police headquarters for questioning and parked it right down the street initially you use you think why's he going so the comments B. plan apart in the lye soap.
We look that up and that was secured overnight when photographic experts reprocess Dibang photograph to remove the window glare from the sun.
East could see the individual standing outside when Tonya Forrester attempted withdrawal in Britain's money.
It was Chris Cruz and when forensic detectives inspected cruises car they found blood on the outside of the car and even more on the inside inside the trunk I think he was basically living out of the vehicle for some time there was his own clothing.
But there was evidence there that.
You can only hope for.
Been in a homicide case police also found a twenty two caliber rifle a five gallon gasoline container in the trunk and a suit jacket Cruz was seen wearing at the after hours club inside the pocket police found a playboy bunny pendant stained with blood it was similar to one Lynn Breeden war in this photograph many items inside the car were covered with blood the spare tire closing a photo album and the tire iron found in the backseat.
In spite of all the evidence police had a serious problem they had no way of knowing to whom the blood in the car belonged to our difficulty in this case is what it what was it we were going to compare it to the normal things that we would use from an autopsy and toxicology exhibits were so badly damaged that the DNA exhibit from those.
Fox college exhibits was not possible if the police couldn't figure out a way to match the blood inside cruises car to Lynn Breeden it was entirely possible that Chris Cruz would walk free.
Police had a lot of circumstantial evidence linking Chris Cruz stole in Britain they found blood in his car on his clothes and they found here and blood on a tire iron found in the backseat was just incredible how much evidence we had and it would be an absolute shame if the suspect had been successful so successful in destroying the body that none of that evidence could be used in order to tie him into the crime the fire not only incinerated Lynn Britain's body but also any chance of a DNA profile for skin blood saliva and hair follicles all possible areas for DNA testing have all been destroyed.
Dr David suite is a forensic odontology just who had been following the Breedon merger in the newspapers he suggested that scientists try something which had never been attempted before they tried to harvest the genetic material from inside greeting his teeth from the tooth pulp in order to generate a DNA profile they ran with the idea of released some evidence to me in the forms of some bones and teeth I was particularly interested in the impacted wisdom teeth or the teeth that were still embedded in the job on both the upper jawbone and the lower jawbone it was my sense that these teeth were more protected from the fire than the other tissues and the other teeth because they were deeper in the core of the body away from the potential heat source the pope was sent to the forensics lab along with samples of blood collected from Chris cruises car I've never thought for a second that tooth pulp can be user any tooth.
Part of any tooth can be used for for DNA testing blood cells were extracted from the tooth pulp and treated with a special chemical cocktail and the D. N. A. floated free sticky bundle of complex molecules.
Next the DNA was cut into smaller pieces marked with a radioactive dye and placed in separate lanes on electrophoretic gel right was subjected to an electric field the separated fragments are then visualized on X. ray film called an auto radiograph which resembles a barcode when scientists compared the blood DNA found in Cruz's trunk on his jacket and on the photo album it matched the DNA profile of Lynn breed it was very clear the match showed that the DNA typing profile from the various exhibits submitted to me match that of the DNA typing profile from the tooth pulled from the victim based on the forensic evidence Chris Cruz was charged with the murder of land Britain.
At the after hours nightclub Lynn Regan and her boyfriend Chris pay cook got into an argument when she flirted with some other men she met.
Witnesses said Lynn was looking for cocaine that night and at some point made the acquaintance of Chris Cruz there was some evidence that the two already knew one another both were models frequented the same night spots and reportedly shared an appetite for cocaine.
Shortly after daybreak they left the after hours to get in some sort of disagreement took place possibly for payment for some drugs crews may have provided.
As they drove home that morning police believe there are as.
As Lynn bracken lay near death with a fractured skull Cruz grabbed his twenty two caliber rifle and shot her three times in the head.
Crews placed the body into the trunk and drove to the deserted parking lot where he dumped the body inside a garbage bag and emptied a five gallon container of gasoline captain the truck.
No one saw the fire as it burned for hours shortly after daybreak on July sixth nineteen ninety one.
According to the fire department.
The fire was probably one gallon the gas away from the total cremation and looking at the victim at the at the time of the discovery you you have to believe that it was close to a full cremation and without the scientific evidence the remains might have gone on identified in the blood in the car on match absolutely made the case indeed the ultimate link up to all this evidence we're so happy to find.
To a victim the murder and the case broke new ground for forensic scientists since it was the first time the DNA evidence from a tooth was used in a criminal case.
S. Cruz was convicted of second degree murder in the death of the lay in breed and sentenced to life in prison Lynn Reid was a very beautiful girl and a lot of people in knowledge that fact there were a lot of areas where she could have done things that she could have done as a result of it.
Fortunately she got caught up in.
A little bit of this cocaine problem.
And the result was that he brought her to the circumstances that led to her death very tragic Chris Cruz himself good looking man a lot going for him he had attended the the university here in town and he was doing what he could that way so was another spoiled life really by him being involved and would take place here a game.
As a result of the drug involvement let's take away the drug I don't believe any of this with.
