In a quiet English village a few hours drive from London a threat was delivered to a local farmer.
On a fence post a severed lamb's head along with the message you next.
The note said little about its author but between the lines it said planting.
Nestled among the lush rolling hills of England's West Country is the tiny village of four.
A cluster of houses lining one main street a farming community where life is simple quiet and peaceful.
But in the spring of nineteen eighty four.
Peace and quiet was shattered following a series of bizarre events that took place here at Whitten hill farm.
Forty four year old Graham back house and his wife Margaret lived at the farm with their two children.
Back house had inherited the farm from his father but by all accounts back house of former hairdresser was not having financial success as a farmer he had to take over the phone to five may have no option in the business and it wasn't pretty obvious that he was kind of reluctant grudging farmer but it was well known that the farm was not making money.
On March thirtieth nineteen eighty four Backhouse reported a grisly and terrifying discovery a severed lamb's head had been impaled on his fence post placed next to it a note warning and large hand written letters you next.
Backhouse told police that this wasn't the first time threats had been made against him he told me that he was receiving.
telephone calls of a threatening nature.
even threats to kill as I recall back house also told police about a threatening letter he had received in the mail which said words to the effect view of ruined my sister's life I'm going to get you busted.
Less than two weeks later the French turned violent.
Margaret back house was heading into town to do some shopping.
She decided to take her husband's car because her car was having some mechanical difficulties.
I have never heard the explosion or Margaret screams for help over the music from its radio.
The bomb is on the fifth but extremely powerful.
It had been planted directly under the driver's seat.
Strictly speaking it wasn't home it was a shortened version of a shot come.
He was constructed from a galvanised steel pipe two inch diameter quarter thick wall to the pipe Margaret back house survived the explosion because the force of the bomb was directed downwards by the high quality construction of the drivers.
But doctors still had to remove more than a pound of pellets and shrapnel from Margaret back houses.
Who now had to accept the fact that the threats against Graham back house were serious when bombs go off you go to take it seriously and people were.
On the same day of the car bomb explosion which seriously injured Margaret back house a threatening letter was delivered to the back house phone.
The message said something to the effect came twice last week.
The note ended with the words.
See you soon.
The words twice and had been mis spell.
And experts believe that the spelling errors.
Investigators also examined the note down beside the severed lands the one which stated you next an analysis of that note revealed a possible clue.
An impression from the circular.
When the doodle is made on a piece of paper the pressure from the writing instrument leaves an impression on the pages underneath the original doodle doodle impressions can be found using a technique called oblique light.
Which cast shadows across the indentations of the paper so that you can see the impression is a row of shops and these can then be photographed.
Police asked ram back house to identify all individuals who may have wanted to harm him he was interviewed at some length about who his enemies were his ex girlfriend's where and things of that nature.
Backhouse told police about one possibility a former foreign worker named David Hopkins back house said he once had a sexual affair with heart conditions white Hutchinson would have had access to explosives and was also an electrician who specialized in wiring automobiles on the day the explosion took place this person was in fact out of the country on holiday and had been out of the country for a three or four days before hand when hot concerns alibi checked out police turned their attention to one of the grand back houses neighbors common the Dale Taylor.
He was a retired engineer seriously depressed over the death of his nineteen year old son take baby who died in a car crash two years earlier but Dale Taylor and back house were involved in a bitter land dispute which they couldn't seem to resolve they live two hundred yards apart.
Comment the Dale Taylor was well liked in the small farming community he was a woodworker and handyman who built this bench for its friends in the building with the words by the Y. inscribed on the back rest.
Despite the differences between back house and the Dale Taylor police did not seriously consider him a suspect in the car bombing there was no reason to suspect that Mr Peter Taylor was in any way shape or form involved in this incident with no other leans back house and his family were given twenty four hour police protection immediately following the bombing after a week Graham back house began to resent the police intrusion and asked them to end the around the clock protection.
Before they left police installed an alarm button connecting the back house home directly to the police station just two weeks later the alarm sounding three scholars began streaming up the hill we knew that something was seriously wrong when the police arrived at the farm they saw a horrific scene of blood and blood was found on the kitchen floor cheers have been overturned.
And at the bottom of the stairs at the end of the whole way laid the body of common the Dale Taylor back houses neighbors he had been shot twice in the chest in his right hand firmly clutch was a Stanley knife inscribed with his own initials C. B. T..
Back house was bleeding profusely with gaping slash wounds on his face and chest.
To see how your wife is very.
She'S doing very well he told police that the Dale Taylor stopped by to ask how his wife was doing in the hospital following the car bomb yeah.
Police roped off the farm and called for forensic detectives to conduct an examination they were particularly interested in the blood trails the one they could see and the one they couldn't find.
Bring him back house told police that he killed Colin but failed Taylor in self defense after his neighbor Windsor and the tax back house with a Stanley knife back Carroll said his neighbor admitted planting the car bomb and it was intended for him not his wife when police searched the Dale Taylor is property they found evidence linking him to the bombing we found a long section of pipe on Graham's quite close to common to Taylor's home.
The remnants of the bomb that were reconstructed the obvious implication was that the pipe bomb had been made by him and come from England.
But forensic detectives were confused by what they found at the scene of the attack.
First the blood spatter on the kitchen floor told a story but it was a story in consistent with back houses version of the.
The circular drops of blood found on the kitchen floor were not consistent with the struggle but indicated that the blood dripped from an individual standings stale.
I see a different shape of Stein the more elongated and some of the standing show attention to them pointing in the direction of travel the the blood back to the surface and something missing Backhouse said he ran for his life from the kitchen down the hall to get his gun.
But police could find no trail of blood we seem to have a man who was dripping blood profusely in the kitchen manages to to move over fifteen foot of carpeted hallway with thanksgiving and it supplies and police were faced with another discrepancy.
Back row said he shot the Dale Taylor after his face and chest had been slashed.
But his blood was not found on the gun had been attacked before firing the gun lobby from his face wound up from his hands read on to the gun as he fired in self defense so both features missing from the government suggested that he wasn't bleeding and hadn't blood standing on him at the time that he picked up dot com the victim was found clutching the Stanley knife firmly in his right hand.
The forensic pathologist found this highly unusual when somebody shot.
When somebody dies they go in.
so then I would expect to see.
The response of the body's response being shot twice in the chest deaths taking place simply to relax the microphone from.
The club clutched tightly in hand and the Dale Taylor is right Tom was bloody.
Life protects that popped up upon back houses chest wound was also inconsistent with the struggle.
I would never expect to see that.
And back house had no defensive injuries commonly found when a person stands off a knife attack the.
Because the fingers.
None of these.
And there was something else something small but significant when police searched back houses study they found a note on one of the pages was a circular do.
Please do all found on the back houses notepad was identical to the impression found on the U. next note is a whole series of circles quite a complicated thing he impressions were quite deep so that you had a good photograph and you were able to catch a good alignment and you can see clearly that it came from the students it was exactly the same there was no doubt whatsoever about this deal does that we're talking about two.
You can see just some very scribble when we turn the page.
I think you can still see the impression this notes is not a very which it has been well handled so it's not terribly clear now but it is still that just sees that.
Still see the impression is that.
Proof that the U. next note was written on Graham back houses own note pad we know how the documents in the form of the unix note that we could positively link with wooden hill from.
Least believe they could now pieces together the bizarre events which led to the cold blooded murder of Colin the Dale Taylor.
After two straight years of crop failures Graham back houses fifty thousand pounds in debt to a local bank and was in desperate need of funds.
Backhaus devised an elaborate scheme to get out of debt once and for all.
His plan was to kill his wife and collect on her life insurance policy which had recently doubled to one hundred thousand.
But he wanted the murder to appear as if Margaret had been killed by someone out to kill him.
So back house fabricated the story about the threatening phone calls and letters.
Back house himself wrote the U. next note and impaled the severed lamb's head on instance post establishing the rooms that someone was out to get.
With the stage now set.
Back house turned his attention to the murder of his wife.
He planted a pipe bomb under the driver's seat of his own car.
He knew his wife would drive his car into town the next morning because her car was having mechanical problems.
Backhaus never like to survive Splosion desperate and fearing the police would consider him a suspect back house panicked and decided to set up a scapegoat someone to divert the police inquiry from himself.
Thank you coming about furniture assembly jurors knew that the two were involved in a land dispute.
When the Dale Taylor accepted Graham's invitation to discuss a piece of furniture he had no way of knowing he had walked into a death trap.
Calling shot twice in the chest in cold blood.
To make the shooting appeared to be in self defense Backhaus slashed himself in the face and chest with the knife he had inscribed with his neighbors initials.
Profusely from the self inflicted wounds back house overturned kitchen chairs to appear there it's been a struggle never.
The shape of the blood spatter would indicate no struggle at all.
Back houses own blood was found on the victim's shirt because he stood directly over the bar when he placed the knife in the dead man's hand.
The crime scene now complete Graham back house called the police sometimes earlier back house planted a piece of pipe on the Dale Taylor's property identical to the type used in making the car.
When the forensic evidence contradicted back house's version of events he was arrested for both the attempted murder of his wife and the murder of Colin the Dale Taylor.
In addition to the blood spatter evidence the doodle impression pound on back houses note pad in the medical examiner's opinion that the cuts on Graham back house were self inflicted.
Another crucial piece of evidence helped sealed the case it came from the letter delivered to the back house phone on the day of the bombing.
Forensic detectives wanted to analyze the.
for saliva hoping to determine the blood type of the individual who sent the letter but they discovered much more.
Under the five pound in the envelope match fibers found in a brown cardigan sweater owned by Graham back.
Further proof the back house had mailed the threatening letter to himself.
Graham back houses plotting continued from his prison cell he conned a fellow prisoner into smuggling out an unsigned letter to a local newspaper the letter implicated Colin but Dale Taylor in the car bomb but the letter was confiscated and back houses hand writing matched the handwriting on the letter delivered to the farm on the day of the.
After a sixty day trial.
Graham back house was convicted of all charges against.
And received two life sentences if somebody had said to run along those lines have never been accepted by anybody I mean this is absolutely truth being stranger than fiction this was an outstanding case in many respects principally because without forensic evidence there was no case the worst aspect was of course the fact that he picked on a totally innocent men in the village.
For no other reason than to try to remove blame from themselves.
