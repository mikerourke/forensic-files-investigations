He had about three weeks ago that said you've been Derek and Eileen Savvas who vanished without trace from their home in humble despite a detailed search for a missing couple by police and hundreds of volunteers it was the information found in some dirt which led police to their whereabouts.
Derek and Eileen servers were a wealthy retired couple who lived a life of English leisure in Hambleton a small village about a two hour drive from London.
The village sits on a narrow peninsula that juts out into Rutland water.
One of Europe's largest man made lake.
The woods in the lake make it a popular vacation destination and the servers had been living here for the past twenty years and a home known locally as the bungalow.
Derek separates had been retired for the past few years and was well known and well liked among neighbors of the small village.
Derek'S wife Eileen was equally well known not only as a volunteer for many local charities but also was a kind and generous friend and neighbor missi service was one of those people who spend all her time visiting people doing things for charity she was always seen and we like to.
Saturday afternoon November thirteenth nineteen ninety three was the last time friends saw Derek separates.
He was having lunch and a few pints of ale here at the finches arms pub.
Friends said Derek left the pub around three thirty that afternoon got into his car and was headed straight home.
Eileen'S servers was last seen on that same afternoon she left this church after attending a charity bazaar she helped organize Eileen told friends she was heading home.
Five days later after the severs.
Previously scheduled appointments friends called the police.
The place where if you're missing for a couple of hours with one and I Y..
Police immediately drove out to the severs home.
The missing couples thirty seven year old son Roger answered the door Derek in nineteen seventy.
I had a look around police took a quick look around the house.
There'S no sign of that anything wrong inside the house by which means no sign of a struggle right now nothing at all but friends weren't convinced that everything was all right.
The severs had never gone away without first canceling their scheduled appointments it was not in the Niger to go away without making arrangements to tort telling people are going to lie.
There is a time he did go he he used to leave me in charge it's a look after the garden and neighbors said it was unusual for Derek and Eileen severs to ask their son Roger to house sit Roger was a disappointment to his parents he was unemployed and had the reputation of being a con man once telling a girl friend that he was a gynecologist.
When police heard the stories they decided to take a closer look around the sever his home.
Six days after friends last saw Derek and Darlene severs the police decided to make a second visit to the severs home this time in daylight.
The officers noticed that the back yard had recently been excavated and there were signs of a fire in the garden and looking through the windows we could see this catching coppers missing that he didn't battle so we decided that we'd use the place palace to go into the bone that I'd have a further search.
Roger severs told police that his parents left for London from the Peter borrow train station.
Police went to the train station armed with a photograph of the severs they asked the employees and regular passengers if they had seen the couple Mr service with this very big money will very badly with the aid of a state and we saw that if anybody had seen them they would run remember them.
But no one at the train station recalled seeing the sappers and police found no evidence they even made it to London.
Already local newspapers ran headlines about the server is mysterious disappearance.
He suspected foul play and decided to conduct a forensic search for blood inside the severs home.
Detectives noticed some suspicious dark stains on the side of the back and performed a castle mired test a damp cotton swab is use to wipe the stain and then some fino Dalene and hydrogen peroxide are added.
The sample of the stain found on the bath tub turned a bright pink.
Positive presumptive test for the presence of blood the fight we found blood didn't necessarily prove conclusively that it come from a violent action the curtain hi Raj and one of the critical themselves in the bathroom anything that happened police also noticed a blood smear on the backseat of Derek severs automobile and the castle Meyer test confirmed that stains on the garage door were indeed blood spatter police noticed something else that was suspicious they found a large number of green fibers in the hallway inside the house in the trunk of Mr severs automobile and on a pair of trousers believed to be Rogers.
The fibers were an important clue because they did not match any items inside the house this was an indication that the source of the fibers had recently been removed the actual item itself was missing so the two fifty eight as with the two service Mr Mrs service so logic tells you that it's gone with the two it's part of the crime scene.
Police were convinced that the severance had been the victims of foul play and suspected that Rogers severs knew more about his parents whereabouts then he was telling them.
Investigators believe that Rogers sever is was involved with his parents disappearance but they had no proof that a crime had been committed and have no hard evidence suggesting where their bodies might be.
The search for the severance began in their own backyard since it appeared the gardens had recently been excavated and there had also been some kind of fire you need a very very big pharma to dispose of bodies and there's no way they could be disposed of on that the police didn't find any human remains but they did find small bits of carpet and clothing in the ashes it was like looking for a needle in a haystack because all around that in these rural this huge expanse of water loss of forest trees woods open feels how honest you find a body that.
Just when all of these searches turned up no clues police finally got a break.
They learned of the strange event which occurred before the sappers were even reported missing.
Police officer on patrol recalled seeing a man in an isolated area called the Paxton Avenue woods something wrong the man Roger separates description.
Needed to relieve myself and then I decided.
Well then move along when you're ready we'll do so.
The officer said the man acted suspiciously well any god any old cultures will tell you don't want leaf mold the end of it I November is not at all the aid going to collect it and set it off by six at night.
When they returned to the area a few days later they found a bloody towel near the spot where the man was seen collecting Lee but the police could find no evidence that the bodies were buried there we data fingertip search of the entire area we never ever reset recovered any further evidence from that scene the title match those in the severs house but without blood samples from Mr and Mrs severs it was difficult to know to whom the blood belonged it was challenging rather frustrating when we do we wanted to find the bodies for two reasons one evidential.
Late one night inspector Palmer study the photographs of the severs automobile as he flipped through the photographs something unusual caught his eye something suspicious about the dirt and mud on Mr severs car the color of the mud just didn't look right this Stein was a lot lighter in color than you would expect from a vehicle on road usage generally speaking of vehicle on road use use a very dark black dark gray dirty Cola this was a long long to Cola.
An analysis of the dried mud on the car might give police some idea of where the car had been to find out detectives called in Dr Tony brown a geologist at the university of Exeter doctor brown began his examination by collecting the soil dirt grass and debris from the wheel wells of Derek severs automobile.
Under a microscope doctor brown analyzed the samples and discovered tiny bits of vegetation mixed in with the mod including my new pieces of mas.
And grass there was even a small piece of fishing line it told us that it was a mixed deciduous woodland probably oak dominated but with all say what several other species.
It was clearly quite to shady the mosque could only come from a little shaded woodland and there was also a fair amount of cross and at first it might seem to contradict the woodland but that's likely to occur either at the edge of a clearing in a woodland walk towards the edge of a woodland and of course the the fishing line suggested it was the somewhere that fishermen parked and doctor brown discovered another microscopic.
than twenty different types of pollen were mixed in with the mod from the wheel well.
Colin is a fine powder like material which is produced by trees and plant life functions as the males in fertilization.
To identify the pollen doctor brown needed to isolate the microscopic pollen granules from the soil.
First by using a series of filters and then by adding hydrofluoric acid chemical so powerful it can dissolve glass the acid dissolves away all remaining materials leaving just the Polish doctor brown was able to identify most of the sample.
Authorities were easy to identify just by sight however he noticed one type of pollen.
He had never seen I knew that I didn't know what it was and then after that of course we we run through the normal process all of identifying unknown problem tonight there are millions of different species of pollen doctor brown look closely at the number and placement of the tiny slits and compared them to the thousands of photographs of pollen samples in his library after looking through scores of samples doctor brown found a match the pollen was from an unusual specimen from a tree not terribly common in England it was pollen from forced chestnut tree.
A tree native to Asia in my whole career of looking at samples from the east Midlands I've never actually seen or chest not fallen from a sample and there was something else unusual about the pollen from the horse chestnut tree it's a heavy.
And because of its weight is too heavy to travel far through the air tends to flow straight down the ground.
For the Rovers wheel arches he was convinced that the car had recently been near a horse chestnut tree.
Police ask doctor brown to identify possible locations that have horse chestnut trees as well as other vegetation matching the samples found in the severs wheel wells doctor brown identified five possible locations to search the first woodland searched was this one the closest to the severance home but an entire day of looking here turned up nothing next they search the second area doctor brown identified a larger woodland near the lake specially trained search teams worked their way down this hill when an officer poked a stick into one of the mountains and found it to be unexpectedly saw.
He cleared away some leaves and loose soil to reveal a patch of human skin police lonely on coverage the bodies of Eileen and Derek separates ironic.
They were found.
Just a few feet away.
Stood a horse chestnut tree they were lying side by side and both of them were wrapped in a green blankets fibers in the green blanket matched the green fibers found in the severance hall way and on the trousers that belong to Roger severs the top layer of leaves and soil was similar to the soil found the next in Avenue one.
Roger severance had been seen by police another layer of soil match the soil in the severs back yard there was even a layer of roof tiles to stabilize the gray.
The tiles match the roof tiles on the severs home Roger was then tied into every step of the progression from the murder to the burial all of the evidence pointed to the severs only son Roger who had a history of personal and financial difficulties is basically penniless.
On Saturday afternoon November thirteenth by his father was at the pub Roger argued with his mother in the kitchen.
He followed her to the bathroom and attack.
Eight times to the head.
Roger then wrapped his mother's body in a green blanket dragged her body to the kitchen leaving a trail of green fibers found in the hallway and on Rogers trousers.
And when he did.
Roger was waiting.
Other times in the head causing the blood drawn to the garage door.
Roger placed his father's body into the backseat of the car where police later noticed a blood smear and he put his mother's body in the trunk where green blanket fibers were later discovered.
Roger drove his father's car to a deserted location in the woods parked under a horse chestnut tree in an area used by fiction and then drag the body.
Roger wanted to limit the time he spent at the scene so instead of taking a break.
Placed the bodies into a ruby and covered them with roofing tiles fertilizer and leaves but the most important piece of evidence came as Roger was driving away.
Calling from the nearby horse chestnut tree flew up into the wheel wells of the automobile Roger severs could never have imagined that this.
Would lead police to his parents grave.
Roger severance was charged in the murder of his parents and during the trial took the witness stand.
His plea for leniency failed.
And he was sentenced to life in prison one of nine we lost two good friends.
I embarked on something which I sort of been rather simplistic link this vehicle with those man made roads that was all I wanted I got a lot more.
A lot more and hopefully it's gonna help a lot of people investigators in the future well I think that the place now certainly follow a lap of the value of what otherwise might just be described as much.
