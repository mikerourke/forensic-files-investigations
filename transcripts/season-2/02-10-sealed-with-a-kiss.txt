For more than a year angry hateful letters were sent to a first grade school teacher in a small mountain village in Pennsylvania.
Many were sexual in nature some threatened violence.
When scientists analyzed the letters they found evidence that the stalking you a lot about the victim more than anyone could possibly imagine.
In nineteen ninety three some hate mail began to arrive at the cool ball learning centers public elementary school in the Pocono mountains in eastern Pennsylvania.
The letters were on site and sent to the principal's making serious allegations against a first grade reading teacher Joanne chambers she had been teaching in the school district for the past eight years.
I thought it was.
Does somebody a disgruntled employee I just wanna know what what I thought was a thing you could you know sit down with that person talk it out and fix it soon letters were sent to Joanne chambers herself had both home and at school.
Thanks I'm smarter than our.
Letters were also distributed to other teachers found in mail slots in the faculty lounge.
Joann chambers was popular with students and was an unlikely target of a hate campaign she was married with a ten year old son and had no known enemies I can speak with assurance about showing his teaching abilities options highly recommended by other teachers in the district she was also highly respected by parents she was outstanding teacher or recommendations show that it appeared that someone had a grudge against her she's.
Cambridge found the whiskey bottle in her desk drawer and said personal items were missing.
Picture of my child and myself and my friend and her daughter was taken from my desk the police suspected that a fellow teacher or school employee was sending the letters since they often alluded to activities going on inside the school.
One of the letters contained an interesting.
It was a snide reference to the school superintendent as colonel.
For character in Hogan's heroes televisions.
The teacher and the school was once overheard referring to the superintendent in this way her name was Paula Knorr rocky like Joanne chambers no rocky also taught first grade and it worked in the school district for eighteen years I was totally surprised I was positive that it wasn't anybody in the building that it could be explained in some other way.
The letters continue but soon there were other incidents the first was something Joanne chambers found under her desk I went to start my life with my children and sat down in the chair and.
How to dress on and put my hand in the district address out I was covered with feces.
I can retire but I felt like I thought that my stomach I thought it was like it was not happening with like this could not happen threatening letters were sent to the FBI lab in Quantico Virginia they found some partial fingerprints on the letters but little else one of the letters warned of possible points.
Just a few days later a hidden camera captured several teachers entering Joanne chambers vacant classrooms.
Chambers coffee Cup from her desk.
The photograph of Joanne chambers stolen from her desk was pasted onto a new picture photocopied and distributed throughout the school yard mailed to parents phones and a copy was taped to the door of the local store there were phone calls to parents saying that I was a lesbian I had aids that in out and then I should be teaching their children I can't tell you what I mean that was such a violation of my being the F. B. I. suggested the Joanne chambers be given a lie detector test to validate her various planes hold on a rocky also volunteered to take a lie detector test hoping to clear her name after suspicions arose from the colonel Klink reference and the coffee Cup incident.
One of the two failed.
On the most.
After ten months of threatening letters X. rated pictures and hidden video surveillance police believe they had a break in the stalking case.
German chambers and pulled on a rocky both took lie detector test about their knowledge of the threatening letter.
Each was asked whether they were involved in making or sending any of the harassing letters.
The other thing.
I was told that I feel my power.
He became the primary suspect I was very upset.
I couldn't believe that it was making things worse instead of better.
She was questioned about the incident at the cool what township police station and she told us chief legal Tony if I'm doing it I don't know I'm doing it and and then she later said he never prove it to me I told him that I needed his help because this didn't make any sense I needed somebody to really look into the whole situation accurately the way it evidently needed to be done and I'd I'd try to make it sound as ridiculous as possible if I had done whatever was going on I don't know I was doing it which was totally absurd and in my mind and my way of thinking later on she would say that that she meant.
Nawrocki said she was videotaped taking joy in chambers coffee Cup because chambers had asked Paul to to get it for the surveillance video tape shows Joanne chambers and Paula nor rocky were both in the classroom and left together just moments before Paul the return for the coffee Cup.
Police national rocky if they could search her home and once again she voluntarily comply they took with them no typewriter that we had they took different kinds of paper and different envelopes the analysis of the Rockies typewriter revealed that it was not the one used to fight the threatening letters.
The paper and envelopes from the Rockies home did not match those used in the threatening letters either the Rockies reputation as a by the book teacher and strict disciplinarian was in sharp contrast to join chambers loose and fun loving classroom style the way the police site Paula was jealous of joy in chambers unconventional teaching style and the popularity that she gained from that style pono rocky was more of a by the book conservative teacher who favor traditional teaching methods residue in chambers would show up in the classroom wearing jeans and a Mickey Mouse tee shirt and you do things like stage water fights with the school administrators which I'd please believe angered ponder rocky as the investigation continues.
So did the threatening letters what is not appearance parents and I was molesting their children I thought my god I thought I was going to be in jail I thought I didn't know what was to happen I would have taken was one child.
This is turning a touch and I wanna touch you think sure I mean I put my arms around my children hi how much and when they were crying by the fall of nineteen ninety four the letters included death threats.
For her own protection Joanne chambers was transferred to another school.
Shortly after her transfer a box in wrapping paper was found at the front door of the school.
Inside was a Barbie doll the throat slashed with a razor blade and covered with.
The dress was identical to one often worn by Joanne chambers the hair was cut and styled like chambers as well I think about my husband like I wanted him to remember me saying goodbye I.
I lived every day thinking that was truly possible that it could be my last in November of nineteen ninety four chambers said a car tried to run off the highway she said she saw the base of the drive.
She'S looking right at me I will never forget that look never I will never forget she looked right at me she said the face she saw was.
When Joe in chambers called police to report the car forced off the highway she said she recognized the face of the other drivers she looked.
I know the phone.
Pollino rocky denied the allegation was arrested and charged with harassment stalking simple and aggravated assault making terroristic threats and recklessly endangering the life of joy in chambers over one hundred counts and all I was finding out that I was charged with many many horrendous things I had never heard about before the school district suspended her from teaching position with pay if convicted he could serve five years in jail.
No rocky maintains her innocence and hired both an attorney and private investigator to help the investigator with the former state policeman and even he admitted that Paul the situation did not look good my first thought was well she's probably guilty and it just looked overwhelming when you look at the at the at the whole complaint the FBI found some partial fingerprints on the threatening letters but they did not match Paula Knorr Rockies the defense team wanted to see if any DNA was present on the threatening letters DNA is the chemical substance which exist in all of ourselves it can be found in blood skin hair bones saliva sweat semen and mucus no two individuals have the same DNA profile except for identical twins the prosecutor would allow DNA testing by the defense only if the results were fully disclosed regardless of the outcome.
Paul this defense team wanted to make sure she understood the ramifications of such an agreement he asked whether the any possible reason that any my DNA should be on any other any possibility whatsoever and I said I'll call if we do this testing and your DNA is found on these stamps are at our envelope flaps your chances you're going to jail we needed they said that we wanted to do it if it was something that would finally help shed some light on the whole thing.
Nope no problem with it at all the cost of the DNA testing approximately seven thousand dollars would have to be paid I called in a rocky.
Examples from both Paula and her husband were sent to a local DNA lab along with the threatening letters and the and.
Amount of DNA that would wind up on the back of stamp one envelope flap depends on how hard you look the envelope how much cells that you shed from the inside of your mouth they're very able so it's hard to predict exactly what the value would be but it is there in some cases there's more DNA than others first scientists use steam to gently remove the stamps from the envelopes the back of the stamp and envelope flap was swabbed for epithelial cells which come from saliva.
DNA was found on the back of one set of stamps and on one envelope flap the number of cells recovered was so small that forensic scientists performed a process called race chain reaction or PCR which amplifies or copies the DNA in those few cells to make enough for testing.
The DNA from the stamps and envelopes clapper added to the PCR mixture a chemical cocktail of enzymes nucleotides and primers and placed in the thermal cycler to amplify color development process produces a series of blue dots visualizing which variation of the DQ alpha gene is present in the genetic profile if there is even one based difference in the three point three billion base pairs on an individual's DNA strands of the DNA we're not blind to the corresponding docked what we're looking for to see is how does this DNA that was extracted compared to somebody else's DNA not the DNA is from a similar source you'll get the same pattern of blue dots on a white strip this is the genetic profile of the individual who licked the stamps when the DNA profile of pollen or rocky and her husband were compared to the DNA from the back of the stamps.
There was no match for example ponder rocky has two dots here and on the DNA from the back of postage stamp only has one so therefore right away we can exclude Paula rocky was just this one genetic marker we looked at five different genetic markers and four out of five can exclude fallen rock DNA was found.
And it did not match for and it did not match one.
Now armed with the DNA profile of the stock.
When DNA testing of the stamps and envelopes black did not match Paula Knorr rocky or her husband the defense team went one step further they wanted to find the individual whose DNA was on the threatening letters all of them do it there's only one other person could have done.
Because there's only one other person that knew the circumstances of all these letters but knew everything that was going on I was doing chambers.
Was it possible that the alleged victim wrote threatening letters and mailed them to herself.
The defense and covered some information which pointed in that very direction.
Police in the neighboring town of Carbondale Pennsylvania told defense investigators the chambers had a history of reporting suspicious incidents from burglaries fires every crime that she's been a victim of this has some weirdness attached to it.
And just off the top of their heads they started relating to different.
Crimes is supposedly she's been a victim of when Anderson research chambers employment history he learned the chambers reported similar threatening letters and also reported finding feces on her classroom chair while in another school district years earlier choose a pattern of being a victim.
And having a pattern of being a victim shows one thing to me I'm not expert at all this but it shows me if you wanna tension.
She wants to be the center of attention to find out if it was Joanne chambers DNA on the threatening letters Jim Anderson needed her DNA profile for that he looked at her trash once trash is placed at the curbside the owner gets up all legal rights to what's inside one plastic drinking straw.
Look for toilet tissue plastic straws news stations and a cotton swab with your wax all items with possible genetic material was sent to the DNA lab for testing doctor looked in Wallner identified two different DNA profiles from the mucus saliva and your wax samples from the chamber's trash one of those DNA profile matched the DNA from the stamps and envelope flap the DNA from the one of the household members similar to the DNA on the back of stamps and.
With these DNA results.
And steam demanded that all charges against Paul and all rocky be dropped the prosecution refuse and Joanne chambers provided a blood sample for further DNA testing once again Joanne chambers blood DNA match the DNA from the stamps and the envelope flap you can see how all five genetic markers one up perfectly between the DNA of Joanne chambers and the DNA from the back of the postage stamps the odds of someone in the random U. S. population having the same combination of five genotypes tested was one in fourteen thousand nine hundred twenty five the match was fairly significant in that you know that's a small community there so it's.
Unlikely that too many people to be walking around with a similar DNA pattern despite the second DNA test the prosecution refused once again to drop their case against Paul on a rocky during the trial.
The prosecution presented the circumstantial evidence against Paul and all rock including the coffee Cup incident and the colonel Klink referenced in one of the threatening letters for the defense teachers from Joanne chambers former school district testified that she made similar claims of harassment years earlier but it was the DNA evidence that's done most courtroom observers the DNA was definitely a bomb shell.
To hear that.
Join chambers saliva was found on the stamps of one of the the threatening letters and the flap of another envelope it was just unbelievable but on the witness stand under oath Joanne chambers had an explanation she said the prosecutor left her alone with the evidence and the stamps fell off one of the envelopes she said she licked the stamps the reattached and when that didn't work use the glue stick at the very least she showed poor judgment at the mo she tampered with important events the prosecution offered no explanation for why join chambers was left alone with the evidence and no explanation was given for why her DNA was also found on the envelope.
As a lifelong stamp collector she has experienced distinguishing ballistic residue from regular stamp that he's safe I know come from knowing stamps and it would look to me just like the gum on recent US stamps and smooth and glistening and look just like that there was no outward evidence that acoustic continues the trial lasted five days and it took the jury less than two hours to reach a verdict.
Not guilty reaction after the verdict was the most amazing thing I've ever seen the alleged victim was being treated as the defendant and the defendant was being treated as the victim in the hallway jurors sought out on Iraqi and hugged her how much they love while doing chambers left the courthouse virtually ignored Joanne chambers denies that she created the campaign of threats against her.
Just a few days later a hidden camera captured several teachers entering Joanne chambers vacant classrooms.
Chambers coffee Cup from her desk.
The photograph of Joanne chambers stolen from her desk was pasted onto a new picture photocopied and distributed throughout the school yard mailed to parents homes and a copy was taped to the door of the local store there were phone calls to parents saying that I was a lesbian I had aids that in out and then I should be teaching their children I can't tell you what I mean that was such a violation of my being the F.
