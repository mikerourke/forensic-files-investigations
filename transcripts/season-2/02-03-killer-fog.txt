With the explosions the smell of smoke and the smell of burning flesh people screaming it was the single most deadly automobile accidents in American history.
Ninety nine vehicles most of them destroyed.
Twelve people died.
The accident happened along the three mile stretch of highway long known for dance.
But what was causing the fog.
The victims and their families wanted answers.
The accident occurred on interstate seventy five in Tennessee on a portion of highway between Chattanooga and Knoxville.
The highway was constructed through a valley which lies between the Cumberland and Great Smoky Mountains.
From the time the highway first opened back in nineteen seventy three they're in the numerous multi vehicle chain reaction accidents in the same three mile section.
The first occurred just four months after the highway open.
Three people died in a seventeen car pileup ten were injured.
Just one month later there was a nine car accident although there were no deaths nine were injured.
During the first six years the highway was open there was an average of one multi car accidents each year.
One of the largest was in November of nineteen seventy eight involving more than sixty fifth six people were killed nearly one hundred injured.
All of the accidents had one thing in common the sudden appearance of the dance the fog reducing visibility to near zero Tennessee state highway officials responded by installing fog warning lights to warn drivers when father was in the area highway patrol officers were posted to stand watch every morning along the fog prone area to make sure drivers slow down when the fog warning lights were activated.
The combination of these two systems worked for eleven years there were no major accidents along the fog prone stretch of interstate seventy five.
But all of that changed on December eleventh nineteen ninety.
As a roll down the window I could hear the cars crashing into each other one after another motor home hit the front end of my throat after just seconds after I had gotten out in a vehicle story hidden in the back of it I'll never forget hearing one he hit other cars and just knock them out awhile October nothing came crashing just to the right of that motor home the explosion was such that it almost knocked me down.
Mike Tripp disposal this fourteen year old boy out of the motor home then rescued the boy's mother and I turned and went back to get our house all I could see was far I could smell her burnt.
His coat came off burning in my hands.
Going over the head with.
The most helpless feeling I've ever had.
The man burned to death.
Twelve people were killed fifty six others injured making it the largest vehicular accident in American history.
These pictures were taken shortly after the accident when most of the fog had dissipated the vehicles so I don't even know if the customer's vehicles will normally was a pick up truck was three foot in length body still in it after eleven years without a serious accident the killer.
I'Ve struck again.
But why the families of the dead and injured demanded answers they wanted to know what caused the dance the fog on December eleventh.
On December eleventh nineteen ninety thirty year old Craig Piper was driving his tractor trailer south on interstate seventy five on his way to visit his mother for the holidays.
Visibility was near zero.
Craig Piper's mother wanted answers and hired attorney Doug fees who's not only a lawyer but also an engineer she wanted fees to find out what caused the terrible fog that was responsible for her son's death she said the two people in that car were killed and that her son had been burned alive in this tractor trailer and was wondering if there was anything that I could do to help her the accident occurred along interstate seventy five at its lowest point in the valley about a half mile from where the interstate crosses the whole wasi river because of its location fog is always been common in this area.
Fog is basically a cloud which forms on the ground fog occurs when there is too much water in the air for the atmosphere to absorb since colder air holds less moisture than warm air and cold air gathers low lying areas the valley through which interstate seventy five passes is perfect for the formation of natural fog.
But the fog described by the accident victims was extremely thick and dense was the fog on the day of the accident naturally produced or was it caused by one or more of the local industries nearby.
All those three days there there was some amount of river fog although it was relatively small our own all three days there was a very noticeable emission of fog related.
Water vapor from the from the bow water facility the boe water paper company is located three miles to the east of the interstate highway it is the largest producer of newsprint in North America and releases large quantities of water vapor into the atmosphere twenty four hours a day as part of the manufacturing process when Davis recommended that the state of Tennessee conducted more detailed study in order to understand the cause of the fogging conditions the state decided not to fund the more detailed study but elected to install a fog warning system along the highway and posted state troopers to patrol the fog prone stretch of highway each and every morning for eleven years the system work between nineteen seventy nine and nineteen ninety there were no serious multi vehicle accident along the three mile stretch of interstate seventy five the system work.
Until December eleventh nineteen ninety.
The wind day this study was an important starting point for Doug the.
But the day the study was conducted twelve years earlier.
Fees needed to know what caused the fog on December eleventh nineteen ninety.
Doug Ducey's heard about a scientist who was using computers to track weather conditions and pollute.
Was it possible that science could recreate the weather conditions on the day of the accident.
Turning down fees wanted to know if the dense fog in the morning of the accident had been produced naturally or was caused by one or more of the local industry or some combination of both.
To find out he hired Dr allocation rotor teachers civil engineering at Harvard University his area of expertise is risk management and he also runs a consulting firm which specializes in air quality modelling engine rotor gathered whether information about the morning of the accident from the Knoxville and Chattanooga airports as well as from two nuclear power plants one only eighteen miles from the sea.
Weather records indicated that there were few if any clouds on the morning of the accident winds were light and the temperature drops rapidly the night before from a high of sixty degrees in the afternoon to almost freezing.
This thirty degree drop in temperature could cause a weather phenomenon called an inversion and inversion occurs when the temperature on the ground is cooler than the temperature in the atmosphere this prevents air and moisture from dissipating into the atmosphere pushing the moisture back towards the ground very early on the morning of the accident a helicopter pilot flying over interstate seventy five noticed a mushroom shaped cloud similar to this one over the boil water paper mill smokestacks three miles east of the accident site action rotor believes this was visual confirmation of the inversion water vapor is produced naturally coming from the back rations from lakes streams rivers and ground moisture doctor engine rotor calculated that the evaporation rate of the natural bodies of water in the area was only three hundred ninety two gallons per day this was barely enough to create even a light let alone dance thank bog described by accident victims and rescue personnel action rotor was convinced there had to be another source of water vapor which caused the fall he noticed a series of ponds which straddled the interstate highway on two sides these were wastewater treatment ponds which belong to the poor water paper plan.
These plans were used to clean the industrial waste water from the paper mill in two of the ponds air raider fans would propel the water up into the air most of the water drop back into the pond some of it did not that's called drift drift droplets or things that drift away from the site of where they are formed all the other droplets fall back to earth or fall back to the point where they originate so we had to do some original calculations in engineering estimate fashion for admission of those droplets ashen rotor calculated that these wastewater treatment ponds added ten million gallons of water vapor into the atmosphere in the twenty four hours preceding the accident far more than the three hundred ninety two gallons from the natural bodies of water at the paper plant itself an additional one point five million gallons of water vapor was being released each day from the smokestacks but it wasn't just water vapor that was being released from the smokestacks paper plants released what are called particular as waste from the paper production process particulates on microscopic particles which becomes surfaces on which water vapor can can dance and this leads to follow not only had the fog potential from the presence of the water vapor but you had a place for it to form in the surfaces of these microparticles is condensation nuclei but how could action rotor tell the water vapor from the Goldwater paper plant three miles away because the fog on the interstate highway on the day of the accident.
He found part of the answer on this aerial video tape shot by a local videographer a few hours after the accident action rotor recognized.
As a drainage flow which carries cooler air down into the valley but action rotor needed to know in which direction the drainage flow was heading to do that he needed to know the exact position of the airplane using navigational charts calculating the position of the sun from the plant angle on the wing and ground references he identified the plane's position relative to the paper mill in the accident site the video tape and then station road that the drainage flow winds pattern was headed west from the location of the paper mail towards the accident site as to the cause of that accident that day there's no doubt in my mind that the industrial fog created by water missions from that border paper mill was a major factor the major factor preponderance Lee major factor informing the fog that caused the accident.
Turning down fees now had scientific evidence and proceeded with the civil suit filed earlier.
In the bowl water paper company and the state of Tennessee.
As Mike drove on interstate seventy five on the morning of the accident the sun was so strong he took his jacket off in the car when Curtis approached the funds on the fog warning lights in one direction work working and those in the other direction had been blinking continuously for three days and were ignored.
The daily police fog patrols had been abandoned years earlier ones in the thick fog.
Visibility was near zero.
Mike Curtis never saw what he had.
Curtis heard crashes people crying for help the explosions and nailed down and ask god to help.
He helped the young boy caught inside a motor home twelve or thirteen year old boy so I got out his mother was inside screaming the adrenaline was pumping and.
I worked for went out and got around after saving the boy and his mother Curtis tried to save the fog.
There was also a tragedy for a woman driving with her granddaughter.
Randall McKeon and his two children also suffered a loss that day.
They lost a wife and mother Judith McKee and burned to death in the accident there was nobody she was over ninety percent down it was slack if you've been cremated.
I'M not saying could be identified but still no one is she dad.
Did the best I could.
The only thing I need to do.
Doug Ducey's case was set for trial in nineteen ninety four more than three years after the accident water disagreed with the scientific calculations used in the action rotor study and hired its own scientific expert Dr George McNeill is a meteorologist from Denver his study concluded that beau waters contribution to the fog on the day of the accident was less than one percent our conclusion was that the fog formed by a natural process do the mixing of moist air at different altitudes at.
About nine o'clock on the morning of December eleventh after the sun did come up and hit the ground enough to start the mixing process.
That in the in a very abbreviated in simplified form is what caused the fog in the morning but shortly before the trial the court ordered the water to release a study it commissioned in nineteen seventy nine from its own consulting firm environmental research and technology.
In an E. R. T. states that luminary evidence suggests that water operations contribute the local paper flux and fogging problems in the Calhoun area Doug fees never got the chance to prove his case in court.
Before the trial the state of Tennessee reached an out of court settlement with fees on behalf of the family see represented because of the malfunctioning fog warning system the state settled for eight hundred thousand dollars and also agreed to install a four million dollar computerized fog detection system when the fog reaches a certain density large signs automatically notify drivers of fog in the area and sensors triggered gates on key entrance ramps closing access to the highway.
water also settled out of court with thirty victims and families represented by Doug fees and other attorneys for eleven million dollars water continues to maintain that the paper mill in treatment ponds had nothing to do with the fog on the day of the accident.
However the water agreed to limit its use of treatment pond number four.
Which set near the highway.
But the issue isn't whether or not pond for is a contributor to fog weather natural water conditions that are in the community or contributors to fog the real point is that fog exists in that particular place from time to time it's natural fog.
And the traffic control mechanisms on the highway have to be sufficient to warn motorists despite the settlement and the new fog warning system many still believe the highway is on say.
Warnings are never the answer when you can do better.
Closure of pond for is not enough to see to see.
This happening again has been substantially reduce.
Nor has the hazard.
This is only the third time I've been here.
