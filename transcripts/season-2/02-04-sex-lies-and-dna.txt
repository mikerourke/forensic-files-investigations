While Earl Morris was vacationing in California he learned his wife had been reported missing from their home in Arizona what.
The search for ruby marks involved dozens of police investigators forensic scientists DNA testing and even the Coast Guard.
The results of that investigation.
Ruby and Earl Morris were partners in both business and in marriage they had been married for over twenty years and where the parents of three grown children.
The marches were both accountants and operated their own accounting and tax preparation firm they had it for years and years.
The bill today you know together from scratch and it was doing very well their business made them millionaires and they raised their three children in this luxurious mountain home just outside of Phoenix.
On June fourth nineteen eighty nine Omar is headed to California to see his oldest daughter Donna K. perform in a concert she was a country singer with a promising career.
Ruby decided not to join her husband on that trip planning instead to go shopping with her other daughters Cindy for some furniture for her new home.
The group he didn't show up on Sunday morning at Cindy's home for the planned shopping trip.
So Cindy drove out to her parents home that's totally unlike her money her mother kept every you know date that she ever had with Erin and less she called and canceled and she didn't do this.
Ruby Morris wasn't home the burglar alarm was turned off ruby's pocketbook was missing but her car was still there although it wasn't parked in its usual spot.
Ruby Morris was a neat meticulous person and her daughter noticed right away that things were out of place.
A faucet was dripping in the back top dirty clothes were piled high inside the washing machine and hadn't been washed a carpet shampoo cleaner was left out but the most troubling discovery was that a twenty two caliber pistol usually kept in a closet was missing Cindy Morris immediately called the police and that's really all I expected it to be was another missing persons case that this person would be found in a couple of hours winner Morris heard the news of his wife's disappearance he told family members that he would head straight home from California.
If Cindy Morris was right and something happened to her mother investigators hope to find some clues to her whereabouts inside the Madras home.
It took Omar is longer than anticipated to drive home from California but when he arrived the police were anxious to speak with them so if you're ready bites Morris told police that their relationship was basically a good one but the cation all arguments nothing out of the ordinary she ever read them anything at all like this before I mean left and yeah she's done it before but she usually calls an hour gets mad or something Morris also confirmed that the twenty two caliber pistol the couple owned was not in the closet where he last saw it we're going in several different directions with this that the possibility of that she was missing possibility of suicide possibility of a homicide the car broke down Earl Morris told police that his car broke down on the drive home from California and that he rented a car to complete the trip.
But detective Logan Beal noticed something suspicious when he looked inside the trunk of the rental car attached to world suitcase was an airline luggage tag for a recent flight from San Diego to Phoenix.
A search of the passenger list from that flight did not include the name of all markets although there was a G. Naresh listed police put together a group of photographs including one of rural Mahrez and showed it to the airline crew members to see if anyone recalls seeing or on that flight one of the flight attendants remembered him distinctly because of the poor quality of his to pay faced with this inconsistency detectives decided to search the Mars home further to see if there was any evidence of foul play which might have been overlooked during their first visit so what we did is we call them the R. I. detects that give us a hand and we ask them to do luminol when luminol sprayed onto an area a black light please use the luminol will actually glow when it comes into contact with the blood enzymes forensic detectives began their search in the master bedroom spraying luminol on the headboard of the bed.
An area instantly turned blue it was a very fine mist.
One they immediately recognized to me upon looking at that you could determine because the distribution the shape of the size of droplets said it was high velocity from gunshot only a bullet produces a fine mist of blood similar to that found on the headboard of beating or stabbing produces a much different blood spatter patterns on the surface of the mattress they found tiny blood stains and they also found blood inside the mattress itself next investigators sprayed luminol in the bathroom.
The entire shower stall lit up basically with the luminal luminol tests also revealed blood on the cement patio outside the master bedroom as well as on the master bedroom carpet we noticed that the whole bedroom floor which was carpeted started to glow in the news the.
From what we were seeing that we did have a violent crime scene maybe death but somebody had suffered some pretty good interest.
But detectives had no idea to whom the blood belonged to find out scientists conducted a DNA test on the blood stained the results of that test shock every dark family secrets.
Would soon be ready.
Police suspected that the blood stain found in the marshes bedroom belonging to ruby Marcus but there was no blood from the body to match the blood in the bedroom.
But science can often identify a blood stained by using DNA testing by analyzing the DNA from children for example scientists can tell whether the blood stain would have come from a parent in the case of children.
Fifty percent of the DNA from each child will come from one parent and the other fifty percent will come from the other parent so this obligated.
inheritance of DNA from the mother to children is one of the important factors that we are looking for and conducting this analysis since children get half of their DNA from their mother and the other half from their father a DNA profile of the children and from one of the parents can give scientists enough genetic information to identify the DNA profile of the other parent even without a blood sample.
If the DNA profile of the missing parent matches the DNA profile of the blood stain scientists will then analyzed the DNA from a missing person siblings to confirm their findings.
When scientists compared Cindy Mara says DNA to the DNA from the blood stain they found one matching band.
They also found one matching band when comparing the DNA profile of ruby's brother to the blood stain it's highly probable that those blood stains came from Marie Morris but scientists noticed something peculiar when they compared o'mara says DNA to the DNA profile of his daughter Cindy.
There were no matching bands Earl Morris was not Cindy's biological father.
When they compared Morris's DNA to his oldest child Randy they discovered the same thing.
World was not Randy's biological father either.
Randy'S DNA match that of his grandfather his mother's father.
When law enforcement authorities in Tennessee learned of these DNA results.
Ruby'S father was charged within six.
According to the DNA test ruby's father had sex with her when she was just fifteen years old well we had a surprise we felt that perhaps the family will be surprised by it in the early morning some self was surprised by the Morris children had another family secrets to reveal they admitted that their mother had been depressed recently since she learned her husband Earl was having an affair with her sister Peggy in fact ruby and her daughter Cindy once called the two together at the Phoenix airport when Peggy secretly flew to Phoenix to meet with our ruby confronted Earl about the affair but he reportedly refused to end it also looking at Peggy the sister she had motive and opportunity to be involved in the still.
she lives in Louisiana at the time but we discovered that she had a planned vacation going to San Diego that weekend we discovered phone calls that Earl had made to her Peggy admitted to police that she had planned to meet IRL in San Diego shortly after ruby disappeared but Mr flight but police knew Earl had been in San Diego not only because of the baggage claim tag on his suitcase but they also found his car in the airport parking lot the car appeared to be clean.
When luminol was applied to the inside of the vehicle the floor of the passenger side revealed a huge blood stain.
So much blood that the individual that came from would almost certainly be day a DNA analysis of the blood in the car revealed that it matched the blood stain found in the Morriss bedroom which scientists concluded belong to ruby we didn't know where the body was.
we didn't know if he would transport the body to San Diego why would you transport them we had no real clue who was here in a San Diego marine.
The Morris is owned a boat which was stored there marina employees told police that Earl Morris was at the marina on June fifth and had taken the boat for a ride when police went to search the boat they discovered it was missing the Coast Guard was asked to help locate the missing boat and they told police about a mysterious fire on a boat about the same size which burned and sank thirteen miles offshore from the San Diego marine this is actual footage of the fire taken by a television news crew there were no survivors no people anywhere in sight the first thing it was unusual with the way burn burn pretty much from the center out normally the buyers starting with the men's room in the film department and just look very suspect Rakhmat beginning so the things that stood out was back there was like a lantern right in the middle of the bald on top of the melt a fibre glass which reflects on the floor there possibly start a fire records indicated that Omar is rented a small boat on the morning of June fifth and returned it around twelve noon about the same time the Coast Guard discovered the burning boat it was beginning to appear at the body of ruby virus was on that burning boat which sank to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
But prosecutors believed that they still had enough evidence to prove ruby Morris had been murdered you start building all those together and then what you have is criminalizes blood ruby Morris is bad really Morris with high velocity gunshot wound.
They killed her in her bed at her home.
Who is there.
Morris was charged with the murder of his wife ruby but the case was far from over investigators were in for another big surprise Morris's defense would be a challenge for forensic science.
In nineteen ninety one Morris went on trial for the murder of his wife.
The prosecution first had to convince the jury that a murder had taken place since there was nobody we had to build a case from scratch we had to prove the corpus delicti that in fact a murder had occurred without the physical evidence for someone to look.
According to the prosecution Mara's entered the master bedroom early on Saturday morning June fourth.
He dragged her body into an adjacent bathroom removed her clothing and put it into the back top to remove the blood.
He then dressed her body in a jogging suit covered her head wound with a baseball cap and carried the body to the garage.
Since his car didn't have a trunk he had no choice but to place the body into the passenger's side of the front seat girls then clean all the blood from inside the house from the head.
began his journey to San Diego.
By the nearly four hundred miles with his wife's body in the seat next.
Blood continued to drip from the head wound falling to the floor beneath the seat later discovered by the luminol test.
stopped once for gas and no one noticed that his passenger was Dan.
When Morris arrived in San Diego Toadies both to the launch.
And in broad daylight place ruby's body on the boat along with some of the bloody sheets and the murder weapon he also took along a lantern and some gasoline.
After renting a smaller boat he sat off to see telling the rented boat behind.
Thirteen miles offshore in the Pacific Ocean o'mara's prepared the boat for destruction hoping to bury not only his wife's body but all of the remaining evidence of his involvement.
After dousing the boat with gasoline he stepped into the rental boat lift the lantern and threw it onto the deck.
He left before being spotted by the Coast Guard.
Some time after March left the scene a news crew captured these pictures while the boat was still on five minutes before it sank.
During the trial Mars delivered a surprising defense he admitted that his wife was dead and that her body was indeed on the boat that burned and sank Mars also admitted to setting the fire and sinking the boat.
But o'mara's insisted he did not kill his wife.
She said she committed suicide because of guilt and depression guilt over the fact that her husband wasn't the father of two of their children and depression about girls affair with her sister Peggy my first thoughts were that I would be going for for ruby commences I.
And you had those thoughts.
Up until that point in time we had circumstantial evidence that she was dead no one to say I saw review Norris's body no one to say I saw ruby Morris injured.
I want to say yeah.
I saw the shooting I heard issued Earl Morris testified that he discovered his wife with a gunshot wound in her left temple and the chief used the couple's twenty two caliber pistol he said he found her body after the suicide and feared he would be blamed.
So he disposed of the body by sinking the boat but the forensic evidence proves otherwise.
The blood spatter evidence told forensic detectives that ruby could not have committed suicide girls set the gunshot wound was in the left side of her head but ruby was right.
It would have been impossible for a right handed individuals to shoot herself in the left temple using her right hand especially with the long barreled twenty two caliber pistol the Mars is owned but the strongest argument came from the blood spatter evidence on the headboard.
The blood patterns revealed two layers of spatter one on top of the.
This told forensic experts that there were two shops.
One shot could not because the distribution of two separate patterns there were actually two separate patterns going to different angles it or not.
You cannot create that in one shot and the person committing suicide does not shoot twice to the head.
The jury saw Errol Morris's last minute claim of suicide as just one more lie.
He was convicted of murder and sentenced to twenty five years to life the drop traces of ruby Morris and that was really Morris on the floor that was ruby Morrison the Camino that was ruby Morrison the bed that was saying this is what happened.
That was our read on it so remorse was actually telling us what happened to her.
If it had not been for the blood in the car.
