There were many eyes on the land along as she walked out on stage for her nightly routine.
She was a popular performer it sly fox lounge club well known for beautiful exotic dance.
Some time after the performance Lana long had an unexpected encounter.
The crime committed that night might have gone unsolved had it not been for a common thread.
Three one Sunday afternoon two boys were playing together on an abandoned highway.
As they ran through a field chasing a parachute.
They discovered a horrible sight.
The new decomposed body of a young woman.
She was lying face down with their hands bound behind her back the cord was wrapped three times around her neck like a leash under her body lay a white silk scarf tied in a knot this call was trying to make a statement he could have killed this one with a lot less trouble.
But the the deepness of this Bruce the the that the prominence of this Bruce indicated that that he applied a lot more force than it was necessary to in this woman's life.
The victim was identified as twenty year old land along an exotic dancer who worked at the sly fox lounge in Tampa detectives found something tire tracks near the body but little else on the side investigators interviewed land along this boyfriend John Cochran Cochran hadn't reported long missing even though they live together and he hadn't seen her for three days he had an explanation of why he didn't report or missing it was kind of vague we were concerned about that.
Cochran admitted that he argued with along on the day of her disappearance about the number of men who were calling her at home asking her out on dates.
Two weeks later a second body was discovered in a deserted location in David a recall getting in the car driving to the crime saying saying to myself please don't let her be bound please don't let her be tied up.
Fell like a ton of bricks I just fall in the party because he would go from rarely having a victim bound.
To now to within two weeks of each other the victim was identified as twenty two year old Michelle Simmons a former beauty contestant who had turned to prostitution to support a drug habit.
Near the body police discovered some fresh tire prints in the soft sand but there was something unusual about the tire impressions the vehicle had three different tires.
Detectives made plaster molds of the tire impressions for analysis hoping they would provide some clues to the identity of the merger.
Because of the similarities in these two cases investigators believed that both murders were committed by the same person.
This time however John Cochran had an alibi and was no longer considered a suspect in the forensics lab when Michelle Sims clothing was analyzed they discovered a tiny clues.
A mysterious red five.
It was similar to a red fiber discovered at the land along crime scene on the white silk scarf found under loans body on September eighteenth nineteen eighty four the new body of the third woman was discovered the victim eighteen year old Chanel Williams who had a prior arrest for prostitution.
This particular case it was a black female.
Her body had been dumped on the roadside she's completely nude she was not bound in any way there were some clothing found next to were tied in a knot.
She had suffered a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
So when you look at this case it it's totally different than the other cases or is it.
The forensics lab found the answer.
Red fibers were discovered on Williams clothing fibers similar to those found on the other two victims while detectives launched a full scale investigation they hoped these mysterious red fibers would lead them to their serial killer before he strikes again.
The Hillsborough County sheriff's department wanted to know all the food about the mysterious red fibers found on the three murdered women.
Each of the tiny fibers was microscopically analyzed and compared.
Under a scanning electron microscope magnified more than one thousand times scientists noticed an unusual size and shape to the fibers instead of being round or square the fibre looks more or less triangular but like a triangle it's been pinched so that you see the three legs sticking out from the core of the fiber.
The fibers from the three women were all tri angular or try a local the next task was to identify whether the fibers were natural or man made since man made fibers are made from chemicals scientists use what is called a melting point apparatus to determine the temperature at which the fiber would break down.
The results revealed that the red fibers were nylon.
And by microscopically measuring the light reflected through the fibers scientists determined that all three trilobal nylon fibers were dyed the exact same color and we're from the same dialogue the conclusion the red nylon trilobal fibers found on the three victims were all from the same source.
Nylon trilobal fiber is used mostly in carpet hi durability inexpensive contact since this fiber masks dirt it's often used in automobiles and hotels next homicide detectives turned their attention to the tire impressions found near the bodies the tire tread experts noticed that there were three different tires on the vehicle.
Russian of the front tire was simple to identify it was an extremely common model made by the Goodyear tire company the right rear tire was manufactured by the good your company as well it was a low price model called the visa but there was something unusual about the trend it was a white wall hi.
And was on the rim with the white wall side facing inward.
The left rear tire could not immediately be identified since it was not among the thousands of known tire treads in the F. B. I.'s computer database so investigators sent the tire impression to the Goodyear tire company in Akron Ohio to see if they could help identify Goodyear's tire expert recognized that it was a specialty tire and a very expensive one not sold in retail stores it was a model called the vote made by the vogue tyre and rubber company and was used exclusively on cattle.
The tire impression showed that it too was a white wall tires which was placed on the vehicle with the white walls side facing inward if the detectives could find the vehicle with this unusual combination of tire treads they would have the vehicle which left the tire tracks at two of the murder scene they also suspected that this vehicle would have red nylon trilobal carpet.
Terry decided not to release this important information to the press serial killers watch the news read the newspaper just like anybody else we were aware of the experience up in Atlanta Georgia with the Wayne Williams case I personally talk with the investigators up there he changed his pattern after he saw it described in the newspaper.
He began reading about trace evidence so he began dumping the bodies in the rivers to wash the bodies and destroy laden portray seven deputies believe the killer was.
Thank you so long Nebraska Avenue with prostitutes usually calm female police the call is walking the strip dressed as prostitutes in an attempt to lure hello the number of patrol cars in the area also was increased.
Author ANA flowers described the search for the killer and her book bound to die.
I'Ve talked to a lot of officers.
You say I have to think like the killer in order to catch him.
I worry what it what would it take for me to become the killer.
Despite police efforts a fourth nude body was discovered in a deserted area the victim twenty eight year old Karen dean's friend who had turned to prostitution to support a drug habit.
Deputies knew that the serial murderer had struck again when they found red nylon trilobal fibers in dean's friends close the pattern that we saw here the way that the the day these bodies laugh the way that they were strangled of the way that they were tied indicated that we had a serial killer despite leaving behind the fiber and tire track evidence.
A seventeen year old girl.
Two thirty AM after working the night shift at this donut shop in Tampa Florida seventeen year old Lisa McVey rode her bicycle home along a dark deserted streets.
Suddenly a man jumped from behind a parked van knocked off her bicycle grabbed her by the hair and forced her into his car.
God help me I was thinking I was going to be killed.
Over the next twenty four hours she was repeatedly raped and sodomized blindfolded petrified and convinced she would die.
Lisa McVey made an important decision I had.
The life of god in me I want to have a willingness to learn to survive that's it the survival part when you're in something like that you'd be surprised yourself what you're capable of.
While still blindfolded McVeigh was permitted to use the bathroom.
She left her fingerprints everywhere she could under the toilet seat around the sink on the hair dryer.
If I had died if I was killed I want them as far as to please whoever found me to know that I was there and I tried Lisa was a very sharp young lady I personally feel what saved her life was her actions in those actions were to say yes Sir and no Sir it to every demand that the suspect made over.
Three in the morning after twenty four hours of captivity Lisa still blindfolded was forced back into the car at gun point she was very street smart although she had been blindfolded she could see under the blindfold enough to give please very important data trying to connect okay clear idea of where I was in I want to know where I was coming from internal bleeding back to check a sealable rifle.
Two hotels side by side.
Lisa noticed the word.
Saw that the seats were white and that the car had red carpet.
the doctor stopped the car for a few minutes and Lisa heard a familiar sound.
A twenty four hour bank teller machine.
A short drive later.
He stopped the car opened the door put Lisa on the street along with.
Warned her not to remove the blindfold for another five minutes and drove away.
While I'm alive I'm here what do I do now.
I look both ways.
Lisa McVey was taken to the hospital and clothing sent to the forensic lab for analysis.
But before it could be analyzed detectives were called to another homicide.
Another new body found near a highway overpass and you could tell it was him they're actually no literatures on the body but you could see ligature marks where he had removed the ligatures.
When the forensic lab analyzed the clothing from Kim swan and Lisa McVey they discovered a shocking piece of information.
Kim swans clothing contained the same red nylon trilobal fibers as the other victims and the same red fibers were found on Lee's summit based club.
We couldn't believe that we have for some reason the killer has not killed he's let a victim survive.
Lisa McVeigh's courage and determination made her the first known survivor of the serial killer could she provide enough information.
When police realised that Lisa McVeigh's rapist was the serial killer the clue she provided took on a new importance.
She saw the word magnum on the dashboard of his car only one car had the word magnum on the dashboard the nineteen seventy eight Dodge magnum a computer search of a Dodge magnum owners in the area revealed a list of four hundred eighty six names McVeigh also told investigators that her a doctor used a twenty four hour bank teller machine shortly before she was released when the records of all bank machine transactions for November fourth were compared with the list of Dodge magnum owners only one name was on both lists.
Robert Bobby Joe long was a thirty one year old part time X. ray technician.
Separated from his wife he was the father of two children since Lisa McVey was blindfolded during most of her captivity she could not positively identify him from photographs.
So Bobby Joe long was immediately placed under twenty four hour surveillance.
Long was followed to this movie theater and when he went inside deputies inspected the tires on his car on the right rear side was a good year visa on the left rear side the expensive specialty tire the vote.
Both tires were inverted with the white ball sides facing inwards they were the same tires and in the same position as the tire impressions found at two of the merger sites.
When long walked out of the movie theater deputies immediately arrested him and confiscated his car for further analysis the tire treads match the plaster impressions taken from two of the crime scene.
Lawns blood type matched the semen stains found on one of the victims but the carpet inside the Dodge magnum that link long all of these crimes.
The red nylon trilobal carpet fibers inside longs Dodge magnum matched the fibers found on the merger women.
And they also match the red fibers on Lisa McVeigh's clothing how is it getting so much fiber evidence on this the clothing of the victims.
Well he was stripping his victims down in the car in your store and the clothes on the floor for this vehicle the victim was kicking the closing kicking and kicking it was picking up the fiber evidence of the forwarders vehicle.
Five references often referred to as a silent witness it doesn't say a fine but it just speaks volumes.
When told of this evidence against him Bobby Joe long confessed to the rape and abduction of Lisa McVey as well as the mergers.
He also confessed to additional murders the police knew nothing about and led them to the bodies.
He confessed to tan mergers it's sad what happened to.
And then I can do something like that to somebody.
All the victims all of them you know and you're talking about a lot of a lot.
You know one way or another.
And it's not a good feeling it's not a pleasant feel I'm not proud of anything I've done.
And the worst thing is I don't understand why I don't understand why.
I'M a firm believer that this is not all the homicides Bobby Joe long do you don't start killing the way Bobby Joe long started killing and we found all the victims no are we going to find all the victims I doubt it.
Not last Sunday he decides to give us the rest of the information and the rest of the store.
