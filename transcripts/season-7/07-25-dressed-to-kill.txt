May be what I ought to be an unemployed Gardner with a history of mental illness was a vital witness in the case of a missing six year old girl.
He still working between songs he provided details about events which took place more than a decade earlier.
Investigators weren't sure the man could be trusted and left it up to forensic science to determine the truth.
Memorial Day weekend nineteen eighty six in Silver Spring Maryland it was so hot six year old Michelle door asked her father if she could play in the small pool in their backyard.
She was playing in the backyard pool for awhile and.
Showing me how she could blow bubbles in the water and that sort of thing.
Michelle was spending the weekend with her father.
Her parents were going through a bitter divorce and custody arrangements for Machel their only child were still being worked out.
Michelle'S mother Dee Dee wanted full custody of her daughter.
I got an ex parte order saying that I was a threat to Michelle and a threat to her and I was physically abusive and she needed court costs the right then.
But those problems were put aside for what Carl believed would be a pleasant weekend with his daughter.
After Carl made line she went back outside to check on the shelves.
But she wasn't there.
So we walked to his neighbor's home the Clark family to see if Michelle was there visiting her friend Elisabeth but they hadn't seen her.
She'S not with you I couldn't believe what Jeff was saying and it just didn't register at first you know that she couldn't meet with a little bit.
And at that point I realized.
You know she's never gone any further than the Clark house the deceased's there's something's wrong.
And Carl door immediately contacted police.
She was not a little girl who would roam off indiscriminately she was not a little girl who would roam off and wander away and take up the strangers the Clark house was fifty feet away.
So I never never had to worry about her crossing the street going wandering off I I if I wanted finder and I knew where to find her.
When police contacted Michelle's mother DD she told them she knew what had happened to Michelle.
She point blank told him that I did it I did something with Michelle.
Michelle'S mother told the police he had threatened to harm his own daughter he had threatened in the heat of anger in the heat of a very horrible divorce to take the daughter took a show away so that her mother couldn't have her anymore you have to take it in the context that that she's a mother who arm is in this very.
Nasty divorce separation custody battle and also somebody who her daughter has just disappeared so you have to take it in that context.
Carl door was outraged by his ex wife's accusation and demanded to be given a polygraph test.
He'S trying to tell me that I didn't pass a polygraph test that's an impossibility I don't have anything to do with the shell disappearing don't tell me I failed a polygraph test.
But that didn't happen.
Carl door was now the prime suspect and soon he would tell police of the role he played in his daughter's disappearance.
In the days after Michelle doors disappearance missing posters were placed throughout the area but there was no sign of the little six year old girl.
Investigators were convinced her father Carl had either kidnapped or killed her.
Carl door had failed a polygraph test and the detective on the case was pressuring him to confess.
Yep insisting you know you've done something I know you've done something with Michelle and and we're gonna find her body and when we find a body I'm coming to get you.
Is what he told me point blank finger in the face you know in my face scream and yell and you know you need you can fast.
Just a few days later.
Carl door confessed.
On three different occasions he told the police he killed his daughter and told the police where they could go and find her body and one of them was underneath the the I guess the crawl space of his house another was in his father's own grave in a cemetery in DC police check the crawl space of the home and found nothing.
They also check the local cemetery where his father was buried but nothing was found.
I felt a lot of pressure the police put a lot of pressure on him and as a result of that pressure in the guilt and the shame and that he felt about his daughter's disappearance he cracked there's no doubt about that he cracked I had I had notice.
Deal with what they were telling me that you were not gonna financial life I just was trying to go into some sort of denial about that.
He then checked himself into a local hospital.
The television was talking to him and that he had the power to find Machel and bring her back to life.
I was starting to lose it.
I mean in a psychiatric sense I mean I was having a nervous breakdown.
I was hallucinating I was seeing things that weren't there I was hearing people that work there.
After three days of much needed rest and sedation Carl was released from the hospital and told the press that he had never confessed.
He said his statements were twisted into an admission of guilt.
To prove his point he asked to take a second polygraph examination.
This time he passed.
Investigators now began to wonder was it possible that someone else had taken Machel door.
In my experience in a case where somebody confesses where were the police have the wrong suspect they seem to try to make all the facts fit around that person so they're so busy doing that and they have the tunnel vision that we have the right suspect this is who it is that they are forget about looking at any other options.
Months went by and then years with no sign of Michelle.
The investigation came to a dead end.
In the minds of police.
Carl door remained a suspect but they had no evidence to charge chain.
Then six years later there was a new development.
Ten days after twenty four year old lore Hotaling disappear from her but that's the home of a family tells reporters they believe they know what happened to her.
In what seemed to be an unrelated case a Harvard graduate Maura Hotaling was reported missing.
She lived a few miles away from Sheldon Carl door.
Laura Hotaling had been stabbed to death in her bedroom wirelessly.
The killer left behind few clues he had done an unusually thorough job of cleaning up the crime scene.
Normally he would have found blood splatter elsewhere in the room were some indications of a fighter.
Something but that area that bedroom the crime scene itself had been cleaned up and cleaned up very.
But he made one mistake in Laura holdings here brush was one foreign here it wasn't human it was from a week.
The hotel lings Gardner thirty year old hadn't Clark was unknown cross dresser.
Get mental problems.
We also discovered he was a cross dresser he would dress in women's clothing.
Investigators believe that after killing Laura Hotaling happen Clark dressed in women's clothing put on the wig and left the scene of the crime in broad daylight without creating any suspicion.
Then police made a startling discovery.
The police say to themselves Hey wait we've we've heard this name before this was a guy that we were looking at who lived in the house where Michelle door was less supposed to have been seen or have gone and so at that point they started really pressing hatin on the Machel door case and looking at him as a very serious suspect hadn't Clark live just two houses away from a shell door at the time of her disappearance his niece Elizabeth was Michelle's playmate.
When Michelle first disappeared hadn't Clark was questioned about his whereabouts that day.
And something unusual happened during his interrogation that should have aroused police suspicions.
Clark confessed to the murder of twenty three year old Laura Hotaling but he denied having anything to do with the disappearance of Michelle door.
But on the day Machel disappeared police discovered that Clark was alone in his brother's home just two doors away from the shelves on.
He was packing his things since his brother had kicked him out because of what he called inappropriate behavior with the children what happened that day back in nineteen eighty six was it had was very angry his brother his brother's wife and his children had left the home in order to give had an opportunity to get his things and get out and they had given him a deadline to get out.
That same day.
East question happened Clark and asked him if he knew anything about Michelle's disappearance.
He was answering questions Bruce Cooper.
When the nature of the interview changed and shell doors name was mentioned hadn't seen tired to be changed he began to shake violently he began to rock back and forth his chair he actually became physically sick and had to leave the room at the mere mention shells.
Although police knew his behavior was unusual it was discounted once Carl door allegedly confessed there was no evidence to suggest that hadn't Clark commercial door other than his own quirky bizarre behavior which could be attributed to a number of things one of which being his own mental illness so that's why the police stepped away from Haddon Clark and focused on Cold War for months and years after Mitchell's disappearance.
How can you not suspect this guy nineteen eighty six if you even you know spend an afternoon with.
It'S a lot to go to Kmart to figure out it's crazy.
Once in prison for Laura Hotaling smarter Clark refused to answer questions about Michelle door.
This is Jim back at at one time he was incarcerated with hadn't Clark in the same prison cell block he had more luck getting happy to talk about his crimes than the police I just want to find out the truth of it so I I got in real close to him and I sort of thought it was a window of opportunities to find out the truth through him rather intimidating him I it became a good friend.
And I talked to him on on many many occasions.
One day while Beckett and Clark were in the prison cafeteria Beckett asked hadn't about Michelle door.
He was saying she was such a lovely young girl and all and I could see was bothering I looked at him and I said I hadn't I said why did you do it.
And when I say it like that he ordered out he says I didn't mean to do it.
You know he did repeatedly he says I didn't mean to do it and he knew what was being said and he knew he just confessed to me that he killed her.
Back then told police that Clark confessed to killing Michelle door in the small bedroom in his brother's home.
But police had no physical or forensic evidence to charge Clark but then they remembered how expertly clock cleaned the crime scene after Laura Hotaling is murder.
Please put two and two together and realized that he had been able to clean meticulously clean a crime scene.
Where there was a lot of blood shed he was able to remove evidence from a crime scene to the point where family members had no idea that a murder had taken place there.
It had been ten years since Michelle's disappearance and hadn't Clark's brother had sold the home and the number of families had occupied it since.
Police wondered whether any forensic evidence remains.
Hadn'T Clark prison roommate told police Clark admitted killing Michelle door in the bedroom in his brother's home.
But ten years had passed and the home had been owned by a number of family since.
The bedroom was only seven by ten feet it had no rugs or carpet but it did have the original oak wood floor.
Unfortunately it had been sanded and refinished with polyurethane at least once possibly more which might have destroyed any evidence that existing.
To find out police used luminol a chemical which glows when it comes into contact with the iron component in blood.
After spraying the floor.
What actually appeared wise long luminescence lines along the slats of the floorboards not on the surface of the floor but deeply embedded in the actual slaps themselves.
The entire floor was taken apart for further tests investigators wanted to know if the blood between the floorboards was human and different wives whose blood was.
Then with hydrogen peroxide only two tiny areas turned purple positive presumptive test for blood.
Unfortunately it wasn't a large enough sample for DNA testing so then we had to decide what else can be done with this particular blood the samples that we definitely want to determine where they originated from so scientists decided to try a mitochondrial DNA test.
Mitochondria exist outside of the cell's nucleus and passed on genetically from a mother to her children.
It'S not as precise as nuclear DNA testing but it still can be used for identification.
There'S a lot more mitosis we call them present in itself and the one nucleus so the theory is because of those mass numbers in each individual cell you have a better opportunity to get a higher level of the mind DNA.
That you might be able to get results with.
The mitochondrial DNA from blood between the floorboards match the mitochondrial DNA profile of Michelle's mother.
In other words somebody from their family.
Left blood at that location.
Since Michelle had been inside the home and not her mother the blood was believed to be Michelle's.
Prosecutors believe that after Carl door went inside to make lunch Michelle left the pool to look for her friend Elisabeth.
In a freak tragic coincidence when Michelle knocked on Elizabeth's door no one was home.
Except Hampton who was packing his things since his brother had ordered him to move out.
We believe that you saw on the show he saw her as an opportunity to vent his rage we also believe that he saw it as an opportunity to get revenge on his brother.
Police believe hadn't killed Michelle in the upstairs bedroom.
Then clean the blood from the floor.
He probably removed Michelle's body in one of the duffel bags neighbor saw him carrying when moving out later that day.
I don't believe he has a an ounce of remorse for what he's done to Michelle and.
Yeah he doesn't deserve.
He doesn't even deserve to live as far as I'm concerned he has one and completely worthless as a human being.
I have nothing to say to a.
I don't need his apologies I don't need anything from him.
Fortunately the sanding polyurethane and ten years worth of detergents hadn't destroyed the mitochondrial DNA evidence.
Carl door has since remarried and moved on with his life.
But he has kept Michelle's letters and this crayons self portrait she drew just days before she was murdered.
She just lost one of her front teeth before she disappeared.
She had a little bit of a gap in her teeth the.
The sweet innocent.
Have a clock was convicted of Michelle Doris murder and was sentenced to a second life term in prison.
Shortly after his conviction hadn't clocked directed police to the shallow grave where he had buried Michelle's body.
It was just twelve miles from her home I believe when Hatton yes the police told the police that he would show the Mormon shell doors body was he asked to be able to dress as a woman the police went and got him women's clothes in a week.
Hadn'T Clark now claims his female persona whom he refers to as Kristin blue fan is the real killer.
He dresses as this woman he writes letters as this woman he speaks as this woman and it is the woman that commits the crimes.
Psychologists say the Clark here apparently unaware of being videotaped before his police interrogation is a paranoid schizophrenic who cannot control his compulsion to kill.
He must be.
He still working on me.
Everyone who knows him is convinced he would kill again if given the chance.
He'S intelligent I think he's he was able to get away with crimes for a long time and I think that he he knows what he's doing he's good at his job.
He is a definite skilled criminals and making sure that the crime scene it's cleaned up all the loose ends are tied up however there's always been some small bit of evidence that we have found to still pinpoint that crime to happen Clark.
