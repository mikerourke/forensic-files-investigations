On Memorial Day weekend in nineteen eighty four.
Someone placed the body in a cardboard box and slid it down and then back.
The cause of death was homicide but investigators had no idea when the murder occurred.
But science uncovered an important detail of the victims last night alive.
Would it be enough to identify the killer.
On a Sunday morning a fisherman and join the Juniata river in central Pennsylvania saw a large cardboard box at the river's edge.
Inside was a garbage bag.
He pulled back a piece of plastic a little bit and discover that it was the part of a person didn't know males female.
The torso was later identified as female.
The rest was a mystery there was no indicator as to how she met her death.
Above the box on the side of the hill the underbrush and then tap down indicating the box had slid down the embankment from the road to Bob.
For blocks and then slid down after the do it settled and then wiped off by the passage of the box and that was important to developing a timeline in this in this case.
Investigators noticed a grease stained punctured a hole in the box and in the grades were small pieces of styrofoam.
Someone had gone to great lengths to conceal the victim's identity by removing the head arms and legs to do this the killer needed time and privacy.
The part that didn't make sense to me about that was.
If someone could make a person's head arms and legs disappear from that day until this day they could easily make the rest of the body disappear so there was some reason for the body to be discovered the body had three large moles and a scar on the abdomen.
Blue jeans and a belt with the zodiac buckle with the only other keys to the victim's identity.
The autopsy the path of the just found evidence of insect activity which was sent to a forensic entomologist for analysis.
An entomologist is an expert in the study of insects.
He identified the eggs as those of the blue bottle fly and the black blow fly both common in many areas of the United States.
The weather conditions around the time the body was discovered and the stage of the egg and larvae development allows the entomologists to provide a rough estimate of the time of death.
Was roughly two days.
That prior to our finding the torso.
This man the victim died sometime late Friday night or early Saturday morning.
The autopsy was not able to identify the cause of death.
The pathologist found semen present during the autopsy but there was no evidence of rape and there was no way to identify the man since this was before DNA testing.
Police knew that in order to identify possible suspects they first had to identify the victim.
We said from the very beginning if we if we find out who she is will find out who who Keller missing persons reports were checked but no one the description of the torso.
Seven months later she was buried still unidentified on March.
And soon forgotten.
One year later a telephone call change.
One year after Jane doe the unidentified murder victim was buried in a pauper's grave in Pennsylvania police received what at first was a routine telephone calls.
A woman told police that her ex sister in law at not Posey had been missing for a year.
She was able to provide police with the detailed physical descriptions.
Should start explaining how right now I would say I can't wear a bikini because of my molds this sounded strikingly similar to the birth marks found on the body there Jane doe a year earlier.
The caller also said Edna Posey always wore a belt with the zodiac buckle.
The policy was a thirty one year old single mother of an eleven year old boy Randy.
And she was no stranger to the seedy side of life in the nearby city of Harrisburg.
He was a tramp unstable relationships short term problems with alcohol and it's not having a stable home environment for Randy among other things.
I was not sure.
I shouldn't say nicest person worked was a sort of wild.
She would meet men in bars quickly move in with them and just as quickly move out only to repeat the same pattern again and again.
And she would sometimes disappear for months at a time without saying a word to anyone.
And no was able to admit that her life was out of control and it asked Donald ruby first on Randy's boy scout leader if Randy could move in with him.
Donald ruby how to boy scout troop that was comprised largely of of boys who had.
Problems in their lives most of them were in families with both mothers only the boys had been into trouble and Donald took this group of boys and formed his own troupe with it.
Randy moved in with Donald ruby and his wife and live with them as if he were on sun.
Forty two year old will be worked as a machinist and had no children of his own.
While many applauded him for his efforts with troubled youngsters some questioned his motives.
Well it's in the eye of the beholder he did some things that that I would win step myself such as the kissing on the lips and so forth.
No I was never that way even with my own children.
That number over a hundred fifty miles away to Virginia where she took a job as a dental technician while trying to get her life back on track.
This is admins co worker who asked not to be identified for fear of her safety.
She was saving her money and sometimes in that particular time period she met a young soldier in the army band in Virginia and now they became quite close to and not all was going to move in together and bring Randy down.
To be with them and police believe that Donald ruby was threatened by the loss of Randy.
The evidence was that she intended to take Randy back with her.
We believed and argued that Donald did not want to give up Randy as his son.
We'Ll be told police that Aetna Posey had come to their home to visit Wednesday on Friday night and planned to stay for the entire Memorial Day weekend.
Not all the next date will be on his wife said they took it not shopping and dropped her off downtown.
We'Ll see you back in like five.
When they returned later to pick her up at night never showed up.
Given the lifestyle that Edna lived for decades that you could sell it very easily that she just decided to disappear off the face of the earth.
But Edna son Randy told police a slightly different story.
He said he last saw his mother on Friday night when she kissed him good night.
A short time later.
He said he heard a loud noise coming from the bedroom where his mother was.
He said when he woke up the next day his mother was gone.
If the forensic entomologist with corrected his estimate of the time of that the staff the noise Randy heard on Friday night may have been his mother's murder.
When police searched Donal ruby's trunk they found the same type of grease that was found on the box holding at the Posies for so.
And they discovered the hole in the box with the same size and shape as the trunk latch in ruby's call.
Prosecutors now believe that Donald ruby murdered the policy on Friday.
When Donald ruby was charged with the murder of that not policy.
He'S heard some unsettling news about his life with Edna's son Randy.
We had testimony that was when they would come home from camping trips he would physically touch Randy's private parts allegedly to feel for ticks so that yes there was some direct evidence of of pedophile.
But he would examine the around the crotch.
Of of the rear end a little bit more than a parent probably would to.
We'Ll explore prosecutors said that was evidence of pedophile.
That ruby had a sexual fixation with Randy and killed Edna to keep her from regaining custody of her son.
They said that the grease and styrofoam evidence on the box containing at those body those circumstantial tied ruby to the crime.
Three years after Edna Posies disappearance Donald ruby was convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison.
And as family and friends believed that a cold blooded killer had gotten justice.
How could you do this to another person I bet it wasn't a lie he just shot her and you know there was no pain and his dad if the cruel cruel way that he killed her and it was just almost unbelievable to me that you could do that to another human being.
From behind bars Donald ruby maintained his innocence he said had not had countless low life lovers and anyone could have committed the crime.
They claimed there was no proof Donald ruby was a peta files and that his rights were violated when jurors heard that testimony.
Ruby'S defense attorneys also decided to have the forensic evidence re examined.
So they call doctor Neil Haskell one of the country's premier forensic entomologist.
Dr Haskell analyze the eggs and larvae from Aetna Posey spot.
But in reading the medical examiner's report Dr Haskell noticed an inconsistency.
At the autopsy the medical examiner said he found eggs but not large.
And he noticed something else at the original autopsy the eggs were scraped from the body and placed in a Petri dish.
The scrapings also contained bits of flesh and blood.
This meant that the eggs had three additional days to feed on the flash and develop before they were analyzed I'm trying to avoid saying the coppers.
Dr Haskell analyze some of the expound on Edna Posies body.
After three years they were so dry they were almost done.
They were then placed in a saline solution to re hydrate.
Dr Haskell believes these ads were on at the Posies body for only a short time meaning that Edna Posey was killed sometime late Saturday night or early Sunday morning not Friday night as the original entomologist estimated.
Signed to the animal logical evidence that was presented in this case clearly showed that the time when the death of this individual had taken place had to be much shorter than what the prosecution was alleging.
The meteorological evidence also pointed to early Sunday morning.
When the fisherman found the body on Sunday morning he said there was no deal or condensation along the path the box traveled down the embankment.
And another factor supporting this time frame was the autopsy report.
The medical examiner said there was smoke toll or moving sperm in Edna's body at the autopsy.
Berm remains mobile energy sees person for only twenty four hours after day.
Donald ruby had an alibi for all day Saturday and Saturday night.
After six years in prison Donald ruby was granted a new trial.
And ruby's new defense team had a surprise piece of evidence.
Tantalizing clue about her last night alive.
Check scientists analyzed the semen recovered during her autopsy.
This time using new DNA technology which wasn't available at Donald ruby's first trial.
In a shocking development DNA testing revealed there was semen from three different and Donald ruby's DNA was not among the.
The autopsy notes revealed that the semen contains multiple sperm at the time of the autopsy.
Permit remain mobile in a dead person for only twenty four hours we had at least three people by the evidence who were with her and had sex with her less than twenty four hours before her body was discovered we were able to exploit that in the trial by planting the suggestion that that Edna true to form had.
gotten on the wild side when she was dropped off in Middletown by don.
Donald ruby second trial his defense was the same as the first product that he and his wife dropped at the off on Saturday morning to go shopping.
This time new forensic evidence help bolster his story.
His attorneys implied that one or more of the unidentified men who had sex with her on Saturday night may have been the killer.
But that was clearly defense insinuation the defense clearly insinuated that somebody that and was picked up by.
We might have committed this murder.
The other new piece of forensic evidence with doctor Haskell's testimony with his view that the original time of death was inaccurate.
He testified that improper preservation of the entomological evidence because an accurate estimation of the time of day.
He told the jury at the Posey died late Saturday night or early Sunday morning not on Friday night as originally claimed.
Further helping ruby's case was at the sun Randy.
At the original trial Randy said he heard a loud thump from his mother's bedroom late on Friday night.
But eight years later Randy now twenty one years old recalled nothing about the fact.
Randy clearly did not remember hearing a thump we asked him about it he said he had no independent recollection of it and thus we did not have the bump in the night to use as testimony.
The defense also claimed that the hole in the car carrying at this body could have been made by thousands of vehicles with the same type of latch and Greece as was in ruby's car.
After a nine day trial and six hours of deliberations the jury found Donald group the not guilty verdict which baffled as friends and family.
Just a total state of shock they could not like that that proved the case and then to have it thrown out like that and mother a lock in the streets I think it was a concern to a lot of people in there especially people who testified against him.
You learn through experience never try to figure out what your.
I don't know what the jury thought with the they made their decision and now how Oliver.
And the case while officially closed remains open in the minds of those involved.
You should be scared of Mr ruby.
Virtually anyone with children.
I don't propose to be an expert in the area but certainly.
The lady opinion the leopard doesn't change its spots I'm convinced Saddam did not.
Kill Adam you might have reason to but he did not do it who did kill I I I have no clue I don't I know it's not dot.
Donald ruby left town soon after the trial and no one not even his own lawyers know where he is today.
I have had a letter that he sent me later that year.
I basically thank me for testifying on his behalf and that.
he was going to have a certain place in this part.
For the welfare the flies in the future.
