It was on a cold wet winter night that a woman called police to report her husband missing.
Rancic evidence revealed that wherever the man when he ran into some trouble.
In the heart of southern California lies the small town of valley center about an hour's drive from San Diego it's a quiet and peaceful community surrounded by hills and farmland.
Almost thirty years.
The couple lived on an eighteen acre horse ranch they called charisma farms.
Bob prefers the outdoors and camping his passion was physical fitness and he was a marathon runner.
The couple had three grown children two sons and a daughter Claire who still lived at home.
There was a marathoner and an expert horsewoman.
On a Sunday night in February of two thousand Jane Dora take called the sheriff to report her husband missing.
She said Bobbitt gone running a few hours earlier but never returned home when she reported him missing what was going through my mind even though he's a jogger and ran marathons I mean they do have heart attacks and things like that sometimes when they're jogging.
It wasn't unusual for Bob to take long runs but he had never been out this long.
The sheriff and his deputies searched the entire area concentrating on Bob's usual running rooms.
Search was ended at four thirty the next morning with the discovery of the body.
Say some trauma to the head.
As well as a cord wrapped around the victim's neck my initial thought in looking at the trauma to the body that this was a homicide.
The lack of blood in the area revealed that Bob's injuries had occurred elsewhere.
They found tire impressions in my two sets of those and we found you impressions that weren't usable but they're just like deep holes in the leaf litter that was on the ground.
They were drag marks in the mile from the area of the tire impressions to the body.
And there was a.
Bob had been jogging back day his shoes were very clean he didn't have any money or any splash marks watermarks on issues and the information I had obtained earlier was that he went out for a jog on the previous day which had been a rainy day as well.
Piece of dark takes head hair was found underneath his shirt on his chest suggesting that he had been dressed after death.
And there was another indication someone else had dressed him.
Laces were tied on the outside of his shoes the night itself was not tied in the middle of the issue is if somebody were to have tie their own shoes.
Whatever the body left mountains of forensic evidence.
Investigators Neil if the killer was this sloppy here the justice careless elsewhere.
Word of Bob Dorough tex merger spread quickly to friends and family alike.
Rancic'S scientists began their investigation by attempting to identify the vehicle at the crime scene.
From the tire impressions in the mind they measured the distance between the wheels the vehicle was identified as a pick up truck.
Next they analyzed photographs of the tire we impressions.
First you have to look at the with of the tire track there's different size tires on a second you look at the design every tire manufacturer has multiple tread designs or they may design for different types of road and lane.
The pickup truck had three different tire models.
Russians were compared to the thousands of tires on the market.
I noticed that the front two tires or the same brand tire which was a big brand.
The Maria identified the side rear tire as a Firestone radial.
And the passenger side rear tire as a tool for brand discoverer models.
The autopsy the medical examiner determined the door take died due to blunt force trauma to the head with some type of hammer.
There were also signs he had been strangled.
Inside his stomach was the on digestive dinner Bob concealment on Saturday night which meant he was killed on Saturday.
James said Bob left home on Sunday afternoon.
Despite his mild mannered demeanor a background check revealed Bob Dorough tech and his wife separated just a few years earlier although they had recently reconciled.
Adult entertainers dogs with his wife and daughter over the costs of running the horse ranch.
Jane and clear favorite investing more money into the ranch for expansion.
And there was the possibility of a disgruntled employee.
Ranch foreman Lee Ann L. Morales had long sided with clear door a tech in the debate over whether to expand the range.
We felt it warranted further investigation in an interview with them to see what time it when was the last time he was there and what did he do when he was there.
James said she was home all day working with the horses.
Cooperated with police by voluntarily allowing them to search her home.
As a homicide detective took me aside before women's center Caroline this is a consent search so I wanted all we're looking for is in obvious blood don't be crawling under things and looking up don't be opening drive don't be doing anything just be as interested as possible.
Investigators examined the house and especially the master bedroom.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Criminalist Caroline Kennedy decided to take a closer look around and it was in her stocking feet.
And that made her discovery is happened to step in one corner of the bedroom and I could feel wet carpet underneath my feet to my stocking feet and my heart just because I know exactly what that was the bedroom floor was wet as if something had recently been clean from the floor and the carpet had a slight tinge of red.
What really struck me was how how easily we could have missed it if we hadn't taken off her shoes you would have missed it we would not have found that scene at all I asked the family if there would be any reason that we find blood in the master bedroom.
Number of family members began to speak one was chained or text sister by long who indicated that one of the dogs had cut his dew claws and had them believing.
Investigators decided to conduct more tests to see if it was a dog in the bedroom or something.
Not long after the merger a fifty five year old Bob Dorough take investigators had no shortage of forensic evidence or suspects.
In the master bedroom of the door takes home.
Investigators found traces of blood on the floor that had been cleaned up.
When they look closer.
They found even more.
I could see what appeared to be blood spatter all across the computer the bad.
I could see blood spatter on the headboard is simple it's better on the wall behind the bad.
And there was blood on the brick wall and on the stove in the corner of the bedroom some had even written down into a utility room below.
They looked at the stains on the wall stains on the brick work and they're all consistent with in size about a half a millimeter in diameter maybe a little bit less a little bit more with medium velocity is what I would expect a scene in a beating.
Merits analysis revealed the blood spatter emanated from the top of the bed where Bob may have been sleeping.
The shapes of the stains on the wall and on the nightstand showed me the direction they were traveling in so I just took strings on the wall.
Knowing the direction they're travelling and pulled back.
Take them on the wall which gave me an area of convergence.
That area of convergence told forensic scientist the location of Bob's head during the attack.
Merritt also found castoff blood spatter on the ceiling.
Created when the blood is thrown from a moving object.
There was a circular stains on the ceiling directly above the bad that's the first indication of caps off the other indication is directional stains linear stands going away from that site.
DNA testing confirmed it was Bob Doran takes blocked the attack didn't occur on that road that attack based on the blood stains.
Occurred in that room.
Inside the home investigators also found a piece of black robe.
I told Jane we were confident and there was no doubt that Bob was assaulted in the master bedroom.
But investigators found no blood anywhere else in the home.
Meeting the killer had carried the body down the stairs and out of the house.
Police couldn't find the murder weapon or any bloody clothing inside the home and there were no signs of forced entry.
An intruder never takes the time to clean the crime scene I've been on one for seven about twenty eight years I've not seen or known of one case where an intruder is coming to a house murdered somebody inside the house and cleaned up afterwards.
Police found a pickup truck in the garage there were no visible signs of blood so investigators look to see if blood had been removed.
We sprayed most of the outside of the truck and also the inside we did find several areas that flourished there was one area in particular on the bed of the truck that Floresta was fairly large which was an indication blood had been present then washed off.
Tires were tight brand the passenger side rear tire was a Cooper discoverer.
The driver side rear tire was a Firestone radial all were identical to the impressions left at the crime scene.
The white pickup truck was registered to Jane Dorothy.
Before leaving the residence investigators found one last piece of evidence.
In the trash there were actually several syringes and one of the syringes was a large barrel Saran.
Here to be a syringe that might be used on animals.
The syringe contained trace amounts of potent horse tranquilizer called ace promisee toxicology tests did not detect days promising and Bob's blood sample although it could have been present in amounts too small for testing to identify.
Often hear it said that one of the best things you can find at a crime scene is a suspect's fingerprints in the victim's blood and not how do you explain that three days after Bob Doran take was found dead on the side of the road his wife Jane was arrested.
And charged with murder.
I like to say that.
In may two thousand one.
Jane Doran takes to trial for the murder of her husband Robert.
Prosecutors believe the gene injected with the horse tranquilizer while he was sleeping on Saturday night.
She then struck in the head while he was in bad.
And then on the floor near the stove.
After dressing the body G. either carried or dragged it down the stairs to her pickup truck.
When she left the body alongside the road she did everything signed her name to the crime.
And the blood underneath his shirt was proof he had been dressed after he was dead.
Friends saw Jane late Sunday afternoon at a nearby shopping center which is where prosecutors think she threw away her bloody clothes and the murder weapon.
Everything that was collected just point the finger itching door tech there all these different pieces of the puzzle and we put it all together it just point the finger at Jantar tech.
The motive appeared to be money.
Jane was very interested in spending a lot of money on the forces the care of the horses the boarding the horses he didn't mind James hobby training class hobby with the horses however that they regularly had disagreements about how many family resources this hobby should use.
Two years earlier when the couple separated J. learned that under California law she would have to pay Bob alimony in the event of a divorce since she was the primary wage earner.
Five initially told me that she was extremely angry about the possibility of having to pay him alimony.
And that she got very.
Reckoning with down some letters dated the Friday before he was killed when he was already looking for a job maybe he said this isn't working out and I think we should go ahead and get a divorce and she.
They produced a letter clear wrote to her father filled with the possibility over alleged abuse.
She just lives her life in trying to please our father to build up a tremendous amount of hatred and resentment over the years about her relationship with the father.
The defense claims that Liam L. Morales was sympathetic to clear his position.
Police were satisfied that each had a solid alibi.
We were confident the car was out of town for the weekend and Jane was on when I was home in chambers I suspect there might.
Where do you know why your mom's point a finger at you cleared all right take care and Lee Ann L. moralis invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination and did not testify.
Jane offered no explanation for how her fingerprint in her husband's blood was found on a syringe containing a horse tranquilizer.
After three days of deliberations the jury returned their verdict.
Find the defendant J. Marguerite guilty of the crime of murder in the first degree in violation of I was sad but it was I was elated that justice was served for me she's told you know one of my best friends away from me and from all these other friends and it was it was it is the worst kind of that really.
Jane Dora tech was sentenced to twenty five years in prison.
There was no dispute about the critical role forensic evidence played Jane Doran takes conviction.
The friends it made it clear he was out for a jog as she explained the friend's ex made it clear his shoes were tied and his clothing was put on after that party was pummeled and so the friends X. told the story as so often is true when you find the body in a homicide case the body itself tells a story.
