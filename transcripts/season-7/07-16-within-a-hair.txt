In nineteen ninety six a serial rapist preyed on women young and old in south bend Indiana.
The man Charlie three victims identified the same man as the perpetrator.
But what happens when the forensic evidence points to one man while the victims are twenty two are not.
Throughout the spring and summer of nineteen ninety six police were investigating for sexual assault and burglary cases in the river park section of south bend Indiana.
All of the crimes occurred on weeknights between eight and eleven PM and the descriptions of the assailants were the same.
He was described as a young black male between sixteen and twenty five years of age about five foot eight inches tall with a thin build.
One of the homes broken into belong to this woman who has asked not to be identified it had rained and storm and I was in bed.
She says the perpetrator kick in the door while she was asleep.
She said she didn't get a good look at him since during the assault he covered her eyes with a shirt first thing he said to me was bitch I want your money.
In this case he assaulted her locked her in a closet then stole her automobile.
But he was clever and left behind very few clues.
He wore gloves so we would leave fingerprints and he wore a hood or mask to conceal his identity I just tried to remember as to what it tells you to do and you'll be all right and I was.
Detective sergeant Cindy Eastman and and challenger we're investigating the crime.
There'S nothing more stressful as investigators than having a serial.
Situation taking place because we now until we solve this they're going to be more victims although the victims described the assailant similarly his ammo or method of operation in each case was different when we're looking at serial offenders usually they stick with what works for them they normally carry the same weapon they normally approached the victim in the same manner.
In some of the cases the perpetrator used a knife in others he used a handgun.
Sometimes he targeted young women on the street and other times broke into the homes of elderly women.
In terms of forensic evidence investigators had very little.
You are there.
The river park rapist most brazen crime happened in July of nineteen ninety six.
The victims were young man and his fiancee.
They were having an argument they decided to stop the car get out just cool off talk it out.
Seemingly out of nowhere the assailant demanded the money.
He struck the young and took off with the woman sexually assaulting her in a wooded area nearby.
The dog walk past the tree line where the assault took place and continued into a field.
At the spot where the dog lost the scent.
Police noticed bicycle tire impressions in the grass raising the possibility that he had used a bicycle to make his get away.
Police staked out the neighborhood looking for a man on bicycles who fit the assailant's description.
It wasn't long before a suspect rolled right into their trap.
Scores of police officers in south bend Indiana search the river park area in the hunt for the river park rapist.
They were looking for a young black male living in the general vicinity of the crimes who was using a bicycle as his method of transportation.
During a stakeout three months into the crime spree a police officer saw a young black man matching the victim's description riding a bicycle just across the street from one of the crime scenes.
The suspect was identified as thirty one year old Richard Alexander.
Although he had previous brushes with the law Alexander denied he was the river park rapist he claimed he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Police headquarters investigators placed Alexander's picture along with five others in a photographic lineup and asked a couple who had been attacked if their assailant was among.
The woman could not identify a subject.
He looked at the photo array and without hesitation pointed to the picture Richard Alexander is being the suspect that robbed them and sexually assaulted the victim.
This was the only positive identification the other victims couldn't say for sure.
But soon they would get a second chance.
Police arrange for another line up this time with the suspects in person.
Once again they were six suspects to choose from number six.
The first to step on to the stage was Richard Alexander.
One for the lead one of the victims gas when they saw him walk out perhaps even fried number three.
Each of the suspects was instructed to repeat phrases that the rapist had used during his attacks.
After hearing his voice to female victims identified Alexander as the rapist bringing the number of identifications to three.
Next forensic scientist analyzed the pubic hair found at one of the crime scenes since I didn't have a route it could not be used for DNA testing.
The only option was to compare it to Richard Alexander is here visually to see if they look similar.
The comparison was inconclusive.
Scientists also had a semen sample from one of the victims who had been unable to identify Alexander from the police line.
When that sample was tested for DNA it did not match Richard Alexander so he was not charged for that crime.
But he was charged with rape confinement burglary and theft in the three other cases.
At the trial.
The prosecution failed to make their case to the jury.
Robert Griffin was one of the twelve jurors.
The working public servant first since sixty seven so I can get a feel for people and I just on the first day I got a feeling that this man to do this.
Nine whites say guilty to blacks said guilty but of a lesser sentence and I said not guilty so I was the only hold out.
Four months later Alexander was tried a second time with a jury composed entirely of white men and women.
Based on the three victims identifications.
Richard Alexander was found guilty of two of the three assaults he was sentenced to seventy years in prison.
I was so angry.
Even officer Eastman had her doubts I was sorry and somewhat surprised to hear that the jury did convict.
I was very conflicted I I have my doubts but I could not prove it.
With Alexander behind bars police assumed the river park rapes were over.
But they were wrong.
The authorities jailed the wrong man.
Richard Alexander says the first year in prison was the hardest but the second third and fourth years behind bars a lot easier.
There'S a pecking order in prison murderers and thieves are held in higher regard than child molesters and rapists.
Alexander says he saw more violence inside the prison than he ever saw outside.
Alexander did what many inmates do he wrote letters to everyone he could think of proclaiming his innocence and asking for another trial with no success.
Meanwhile the burglaries and sexual assaults continue this time not in the river park section but just a short distance away.
And one of those victims identified Richard Alexander's picture from a photo lineup as the assailant.
Even though Alexander was in prison.
Detective Ryan Harmon was assigned to investigate these new cases and noticed similarities with the earlier cases I didn't investigate park rapes nineteen ninety six so I became a lot more familiar with what happened next.
The search for the perpetrator took an unexpected turn in April of two thousand.
When a man called police to say there was a tan Cadillac in his driveway and that was a burglar inside.
When the intruder saw the homeowner he fled on foot.
In the foyer was a clear foot impressions which was collected for analysis.
Police found everything they needed.
I found utility bills some receipts different piece of paper that showed Michael Murphy's name on there as well as the specific address an apartment number.
Background check revealed Michael Murphy had been implicated for sexually assaulting his girlfriend's nine year old niece.
Tester what actually stop telephone actually going through with it was his pager went off she said.
Detective Harmon interviewed both Murphy's girlfriend and the little girl's mother well these two girls one off two hours about all these different types of burglaries he committed Michael that is big and bad and Dadi was cool what he was doing and thinking he could get away with what he was doing.
With the search warrant investigators discovered a pair of shoes and Murphy's closet which matched the shoe impression at the burglary scene.
Murphy'S girlfriend gave police some pictures of Murphy with some of the items he had stolen in the burglaries.
When confronted with the evidence Murphy said little it's eight when I'm all hyped up on cocaine I need to go out and just.
You'Ll find a girl what things like that told me that he may be a sex offender.
Harmon then called the first investigator of the riverpark grades to ask whether she had ever heard of Michael Murphy.
He'S been arrested by me the month prior so we began working together at that point on.
Murphy and various other crimes that he had been involved in.
When Cindy Eastman saw the photographs given to police by Murphy's girlfriend.
You saw an important.
In one of the pictures was a chrome and glass wall clock stolen during the sexual assault in nineteen ninety seven a crime that Richard Alexander was suspected of committing Eastman immediately phone Murphy's girlfriend she immediately said I know exactly what you're talking about I remember when he came home with it is hanging on my wall do you want it Cindy revisited that victim in Asker do you have any photographs that may depict the same clock and she had a photograph of her her son during the holidays standing in front of this clock.
Both detectives began to suspect that the real river park rapist wasn't Richard Alexander Michael Murphy they just needed some way to prove.
During Richard Alexander's trial five years earlier.
You be careful around on one of the victims could not be tested for DNA since there was no real material on the hair shaft.
But science has changed in the five years since Alexander's conviction.
In nineteen ninety six forensic scientists began using a new test to look for DNA in a shaft of hair.
The new test was called mitochondrial DNA.
How to conduct a DNA has given us tremendous power prince to case work to solve the case work where no on thirteen April can be obtained.
It exists outside of the cell's nucleus although it is not as precise as nuclear DNA it still can provide much genetic information.
The technician was clean the hair with chemical solutions which purify the DNA sample.
The second step is to amplify it or to make enough copies to analyze.
The mitochondrial DNA from the hair.
To both Richard Alexander as well as Michael Murphy.
The DNA from the pubic hair did not match Richard Alexander.
We determine that at every place that we tested these two samples at all on average eight hundred bases that we compared they were identical to each other.
I got the word and it was just.
We knew then that rich Alexander was going to be released from prison.
Next scientists perform DNA testing of the second piece of evidence from the river park rapes semen from the rape test kits.
In yet another surprise the DNA did not match Michael Murphy as investigators assumed it would.
The DNA profile was St entered into the DNA database of convicted sex offenders in the state of Indiana.
And there was another surprise it matched a third man.
Convicted sex offender Mark Williams.
It'S just unbelievable to get this call from the state police lab and there we have it we have the two suspects and now it all makes sense.
Ironically Richard Alexander Michael Murphy and Mark Williams look similar.
All three of these pictures showed a male black who appeared to be within a close age range all three had a similar musculature and stature all three of them had similar complexions and bone structure and.
They did resemble each other which again answered the other mystery in this case when confronted with the mitochondrial DNA evidence Michael Murphy confessed.
He'S just doing nothing but burglarizing homes every day throughout the whole city I'm looking back I think he's he's in well over two hundred hundred fifty that I know of that he's confessed to.
Ironically Michael Murphy and his girlfriend who knew nothing about the sexual assault follow the river park rape cases on television.
What time was sitting at home watching TV and they show the guy Alexander I made a comment about you know to say and what he done you know and if he done it I hope you know he I told us I hope they kill and put them put them under you know in my consulting go find nothing now he do them right.
In the face of this new DNA evidence Richard Alexander was released from prison after serving five years and four months for crimes he did not commit.
All it was cheers everybody stood up and cheered and demand.
It was so gratifying to me when afterwards he came up to me.
And I held my hand out but he had to mean anything to me and that's all that needed to be said.
It just solidified all the work yeah hi it was like going into a card game you know you kind of royal flush what's going to be a.
Still hurts still heard because really nothing been done.
Five and a half years your life taking from your family love one of her.
Michael Murphy was convicted of one count of burglary and one count of sexual molestation he was sentenced to thirty years in prison.
Mark Williams was convicted of one count of rape and sentenced to forty years in prison.
Richard Alexander was a victim of mistaken identity is innocent bicycle ride past the crime scene cost him his freedom.
Now science had vindicated.
Sometimes one tiny hair can say more about guilt or innocence and a handful of eyewitnesses.
