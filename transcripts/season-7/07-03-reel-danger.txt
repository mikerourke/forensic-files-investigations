In nineteen ninety one this tranquil pond in rural Connecticut was the scene of a horrific crime.
Two young boys were.
Our own into the water and left for dead.
Investigators had little evidence until they examined the pond itself and found thousands of clues in visible to the naked eye in a simple drop of water.
Waterford a small Connecticut town where the water table is so high homes are built around numerous small ponds and lakes.
In nineteen ninety one two boys will call Steven and Bobby decided to spend their afternoon fishing at their favorite spot stingers pond.
Sometime later they were approached by three older boys they didn't know.
Without warning one pulled a knife the other two fruit Steven and Bobby to the ground.
Steven tried to fight back but was hit on the head with a baseball bat almost knocking him unconscious.
Both boys had their hands and feet bound with duct tape and their mouths covered.
Once out in the pond Stephen was hit once again and held under water so that he would drown.
Bobby was next.
Fortunately he saw the back coming in doctor and pretended to be unconscious.
After throwing Steven and Bobby's fishing rods in the water they took the boys bicycles in flat.
Bobby was able to remove the duct tape from his hands mouth and he swam to Steven to try and save.
By the time he got there Stephen was unconscious Bobby managed to get him to shore then carried him a quarter mile to the nearest whole.
One had a serious head wound and was not very coherent and the other was just terrible and so I knew that something awful what happened to the two boys and and that that would be something that we would sort out over the next couple of minutes but I think the the duct tape was really almost my first impression because I thought oh my god someone to tape the rest together.
Stephen was rushed to the emergency room at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital.
Dr John urban Nettie was Stevens Dr.
Despite the number of people that I've seen with this kind of circumstance he came as close as I've ever seen anyone come to not surviving.
As Stephen lay in intensive care doctors questioned whether he would live or die.
And Waterford police had questions of their own.
Who had tried to murder Steven and Bobby.
Watford police detective Donald McCarthy was assigned to investigate the assault and attempted murder of the two young boys at stingers pond.
Thirteen year old Steven was fighting for his life the victim not only of an attempted drowning but of massive head wounds.
One of the doctors had told one of my detectives at the time that was the closest he had ever seen anybody come to drowning in not being dead.
He was very lucky the older troubles unconscious had he not had his little friend with him he probably would have drowned I think.
Stephens friend Bobby had escaped serious injury.
I think the remarkable thing is yet the presence of mind to immediately go to his friend it had pulled his friend from the water there's no doubt in our minds if he did not.
Remove that duct tape of the old email would have died if you did not remove him from the body water.
When he came to the door the little guy amazingly was quite a bit smaller than his friend was just literally supporting him completely.
Police went to stingers pond to collect evidence but they ran into a major obstacles the crime scene was a body of water.
The fishing poles tackle box the suspects are try to sanitise the crime scene by throwing those items in the water so that the police would not recover them making it difficult that fact that they were submerged in water we would not normally not have fingerprints available to us.
The back used as a weapon was found floating in a nearby sewer grate but there were no fingerprints.
And any other possible evidence such as hairs and fibers had apparently been washed into the water.
Police talked to residents of the neighborhood closest to stingers pond to see if they had seen anything unusual.
Susan the card came forward to say that earlier on the day of the attack.
A young teenager she had never seen before came to her door asking for help.
Yeah I was walking down the street.
When I began to feel like heading home we may I come in and get something to eat he said he wasn't feeling well he was a diabetic and was in need of something whether it was sugar or.
Orange juice or a piece of chocolate or something I immediately felt bad for him and invited him in.
Mrs Bacardi gave the young man a glass of orange juice.
A few minutes later he said he was feeling better thanked her and left because I can call the doctor no no I'm fine thanks.
Later as Mrs Bacardi was about to take a shower.
She saw something unusual in her bathroom mirror.
And I caught the image of what was going on in my backyard come up stairs and I saw two other youngsters in the corner of my yard teenagers sixteen ash around there.
a red headed boy and another half American young man.
And they were later joined by the young man who just left Mrs the card is home she gave me orange juice futures.
The boys had a bright green baseball bat and what looks like rolls of duct tape.
I automatically panicked in new whatever the F. plan was not going to happen in my house so I yelled out the window to them.
I think you believe it's obvious that you're planning something or Europe to travel or and I'm calling the police so if you know what's good for you then you better get going.
Susan party was able to provide a detailed description of the boy who come to her door.
The card told us two things that that stood out one he was wearing eye glasses and describe those eye glasses to us the other was hit on an usual shaped scar a U. shaped race car on his forearm.
Since the perpetrators were apparently on foot police check the neighborhoods nearest to Stanger spawned.
He put officers in that neighborhood and started doing neighborhood campuses and that based on the description of the three suspects as a result we were able to identify the suspect immediately.
This suspect seventeen year old Brian Davis had the op raised scarring described by Susan Bacardi.
Our neighborhood informants identified the two friends Davis spent the most time with.
One was seventeen year old Christopher green the other was an African American juvenile whom we'll call Jason.
All three suspects fit the descriptions provided by Susan Bacardi but denied they were involved in the assault.
In Christopher green's house.
He'S found a knife like the one Bobby had told them about.
In green space meant they found a pair of wet muddy sneakers.
We inquired of the suspect why are these things what he was trying to tell us that it was as a result of walking through mud puddles and things like that as soon as he said that we started working on the theory that how do we attack that she's coming up with the defense this is how my clothes got wet I was playing in mud puddles and things like this.
And if so how could scientists prove it.
But the answer is police turned to a new type of forensic science one that had never before been used in a criminal case anywhere in the world.
Thirteen year old Steven the oldest of the two boys who were assaulted and left for dead in stingers pond was in intensive care for a week.
His condition gradually improved he was extremely fortunate doctors found no evidence of permanent injury.
Fortunately he had an episode that was short enough so that he suffered no permanent injury to his brain.
But during the time of recovery he needed fair amount of intensive care support.
Police have three suspects in custody.
Ryan Davis Christopher green and the juvenile we'll call Jason.
All denied any involvement in the attacks.
Brian Davis and Jason had no prior brushes with the law but Christopher green had a long history of petty offenses and small time violence.
Police took the sneakers from green's basement but no one was sure if the mud on the soles could be used as evidence we had the shoes how do we find out now find someone who's gonna tell us what to do with this.
In exactly what we're trying to do.
Waterford police spent weeks calling around the country looking for someone who might be able to help.
The FBI told them of the scientist at nearby Connecticut college.
We are all going all over the United States Connecticut colleges three minutes five minutes from our police station.
The scientist was Dr Peter Siver a forensically knowledge is an expert on microscopic life in fresh water environments.
He took the mud from the sneakers and added a mixture of sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate which removes the dirt.
Leaving behind only the life forms that may have existed in the water.
It'S a world invisible to the naked eye.
Inside that small drop of water exists literally hundreds of different organisms they come in all different arrays all different shapes all different colors and it's an entirely different world under these that one drop of water.
And what doctor cipher found were diet Tom's microscopic single celled organisms a form of algae.
Each diet Tom is housed in an incredibly complex structure made up of silicon or glass.
I would say that die times are pieces of art they're pieces of art because the H. di Tom can make exactly the same pattern each time it makes the missile and these patterns are very ornate they're highly artistic in their look.
While diet Tom's may be art they can also be pieces of evidence.
Any body of water has hundreds if not thousands of species of diet Thomas.
The types of diet toms and how many exist the various species is unique to that body of water.
In any given water body you can essentially examine the microscopic organisms and in fact I create a fingerprint for that water five.
On the sneakers.
Dr cyber found large numbers of one type of diet Tom known as you know show.
Shown here you know show are characterized by the crescent shapes of their glass shelves.
There were three species of you know show on the suspect's sneakers and they were there an unusually high concentrations.
And doctor Siver found one more clue he found what's known as a scaled crisis a fight.
It was only one species of Christ a fight in the mind malam data shown here magnified two thousand times.
When Dr cyber analyzed the water samples from stingers pond he found the same high concentrations of your notion and the same species of skilled price of fight.
The fingerprint of the water it's staying response was the same as the sample on the sneakers of Christopher green.
This was the break police had been counting on.
One thing that we found is there's always a scientist out there.
As off the wall as as it may sound or what you're trying to accomplish we have found is always somebody out there that will listen to you.
Christopher Greene Brian Davis and Jason were arrested and charged with assault and attempted murder.
But the question now turned to motive why did they attack the two young boys and was there another intended victim that day.
Iran six scientists found a way to prove that one of the suspects sneakers had been in the water it's stingers pond where the two young boys had been assaulted and left for dead.
I think the physical evidence in this case we just overwhelming and and I the diet Thompson in the pond evidence or the aquatic Evans whatever way you want to use it was just devastating and I think the defense attorneys realize that.
The forensic analysis showed that when Christopher green went into the water to strike his victims he got mud on his shoes mod that contained the microscopic finger print of the water in stingers pond.
The diet Tom's in that much clearly tied him to the crime scene.
For me I thought it was unique and unusual because it's something that you normally don't read about in textbooks.
Even though Steven and Bobby's bicycles were stolen after the assault police and prosecutors do not believe robbery was the motive.
These three kids I am totally convinced we're on a mission that day.
As a result of interviewing in the the three after their arrest.
They went out that day to look to kill somebody there's no doubt in my mind.
Yeah police believe that Susan the card he was originally the intended victim.
Brian Davis did not have diabetes as he claimed but only used it as an excuse to gain entry to her home.
When he rejoined his accomplices in Susan's backyard they may have been planning how to get into the house the real warm bells went off when I went upstairs and I sought to poison the former yard and then I sort of all put it together and then I started feeling like I was just set up.
Unfortunately Susan Bacardi saw them into a bathroom mirror and called the police.
She looks back to that day and often wonders how close she was to danger.
A great way to describe it as the sixth sense the mayor was in the right place the kids were in the right place it was meant to be for me to see them and to just by their body language understand that.
Something is not right here.
Police determined that Christopher green the only one of the defendants with a history of violence instigated the attacks.
Christopher Greene was probably the ringleader.
For the other two he was the one that brought the bad.
He was the one that brought the duct tape he was the one that did the striking on our victims he's the one that basically directed the other two.
Brian Davis and Christopher green were both tried as adults and were sentenced to a minimum of eighteen years in prison.
Their sixteen year old accomplice Jason was only two weeks shy of his seventeenth birthday when he committed the crime as a result he was tried and convicted as a juvenile and was sentenced to spend time in the facility for young offenders he has since been released.
The microscopic diet Tom evidence on Christopher green sneakers so simple and purpose so magnificent and design and so potent as evidence.
For Waterford police and for law enforcement around the world the case set a precedent.
It'S a landmark case it was the first time that this evidence or evidence of an aquatic environment meaning the dial times were used to place a suspect at a crime scene.
We found that I had never been used before.
It was nice about it is they were willing to.
To take it on and try it and and that was the key for us.
Shortly after this case law enforcement in Switzerland solve the murder of a young boy using diet Tom evidence the boy had drowned and the species of diet toms in the victim's lungs match the species of diet Tom's found on the gas pedal of the suspects automobiles.
Both cases were solved because a group of Connecticut detectives had a hunch that some mud on the bottom of the issue my tie a suspect to a crime.
But you got to be aware of the sciences that are there to help you if you don't you're giving yourself a lot of thoughts that would kind of across the came up with we always thought were unusual but nine of the ten times he was right I have to say ninety nine point eight percent of the time he was right for.
