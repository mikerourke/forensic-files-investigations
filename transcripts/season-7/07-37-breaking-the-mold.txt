This young couple had everything.
Six S. for careers money time to enjoy it and a home fit for a movie star.
Then everything changed their three year old son develop serious respiratory problems and his father started showing signs of Alzheimer's disease.
Branch six scientists needed to know whether these illnesses were bad luck bad genes or something else.
Dripping springs Texas a town where you can enjoy the beauty of the Texas hill country.
Yet commute to downtown Austin and just over half an hour.
Melinda Ballard fell in love with dripping springs and bought this Georgian style mansion on seventy two acres of land.
In nineteen ninety four G. Matt Ron Allison.
After dating for less than a year the couple married.
Why is everything I have ever wanted me very intelligent a real go getter a workaholic which is what I am so we seem to match up pretty well in that regard just a super guy.
We both have the same interest we both one and then have a family I think that was the man okay.
Career wise about similar interests.
Melinda had been head of her own public relations business the firm she sold in nineteen eighty nine but she still continued her career.
I said as a board member of the bank and still represent a number of clients that are.
I guess holdovers from my company and in New York.
Ron worked in investment banking and was head of corporate finance at his firm.
In nineteen ninety six Melinda gave birth to their son Reece Ron loves being a father and a weekend baseball coach.
Then in February nineteen ninety nine three year old race develop what seemed like a flu.
He started having some respiratory problems and he would have a real hard time catching his breath.
The symptoms lingered.
One month later we seem to be getting worse not better.
That nationally we thought maybe it's because races in pre school and nursery school and you know how kids just they constantly get contaminate one another with a little bug or virus.
Doctors could find nothing wrong tests were inconclusive when he was taken for allergy test those two were negative.
Soon recess problems move from respiratory to neurological.
It was detaining quickly and we were taking him to doctor after doctor after doctor and they told us that something was wrong but they didn't know what it was.
When doctors came up empty a team of forensic scientist and epidemiologist had better luck.
Linda Ballard was living the dream life.
She and her husband had a beautiful home a healthy adorable son and successful careers until their three year old son developed a serious illness I didn't know he had some kind of rare disease that nobody's ever heard I I didn't know what to think but I know it was getting worse and that we weren't.
Not able at the time ten.
Get a handle on the situation Reese was still asthmatic very asthmatic in fact he's the pulmonologist said he had scars lung tissue.
Still calls couldn't be found.
It appeared to Ron's co workers that the stress associated with his son's illness was starting to get to him.
Follow sitting at his desk.
And Ron was looking at this computer screen which was unusual but when I walked closer to his desk.
I realized he was staring at a blank screen.
And Ron exhibited other symptoms.
He came out of the grocery store.
And could not remember where he parked his car or what car he even drought.
It took about five hours to come back from the grocery store when it should have taken about twenty minutes and when he gets home the everything's melted and he said I don't know I I may have been a I had a blackout or something.
I didn't know what was going on in the way elsewhere or coming off and it was it was I was I was scared.
Ron went to a neurologist for testing the result showed a dramatic decrease in his cognitive abilities.
My doctor sat me down and tell me that I was about halfway through the progression of Alzheimer's.
And that's based on my my neurological test results but that's all he could tell me is that you're you're you're you're functioning on this level and it's seems to be getting worse but they didn't know exactly wire or what to do about it.
On April first nineteen ninety nine Melinda boarded a Southwest Airlines flight heading to little rock Arkansas.
It was a flight that forever changed the course of her life.
A man named bill holder was assigned to the seat next to Marlins.
On the way to Dallas which was our first I heard her talking to some people that are certain by me and she was complaining about all these illnesses and problems that she and her family were haven't.
And without warning Melinda fell ill.
And I kept coughing up blood.
And bill holder said to me lately what the world's wrong with you I said I really don't know.
She told holder that a month earlier there was a leak in her home causing the downstairs floors to buckle.
Former repaired the leak which was in the water line leading to the refrigerator ice maker.
Holder began to suspect that it was a mold causing the family's illness.
Holder owns the assured indoor air quality business that removes toxic mold from buildings.
But Melinda dismissed this possibility she kept her home spotless and no one in our family tested positive for allergies the allergist did these little tests to determine whether or not we were allergic to model and it came back that we worked so I dismissed it as as our problem.
But during their conversation on the plane holder said something prophetic.
Please tell me these are allergens lady this is a poise.
Now suspecting that there was some kind of mold behind the wall above the ceiling somewhere run in Melinda decided not to take any chances and moved out of the main house into an apartment over the garage.
But even with the move Ron's neurological problems continue to get worse.
At the office I would be on a phone call and and.
Ten or twenty minutes into the phone call does not have any idea what we discussed.
If there was some kind of mold behind the wall or ceiling.
How would investigators find.
Medical experts began to suspect that something in their home environment was making Ron Melinda and re sick.
The property included seventy two acres.
There was a man made pond that Melinda stocked with swans and catfish.
A barn for horses.
A backyard gazebo and pool.
The house itself was enormous twelve thousand square feet modeled after the movie version of.
Scarlett o'hara's plantation home in gone with the wind it was lots of columns the Georgian style home antebellum and it was just gorgeous.
Scientific experts began to focus on the possibility that it was small.
For mold to grow it requires water to be where it shouldn't be it requires cellulose which is a component of most building materials for example sheet rock of ceiling tiles pressed particle board and then a mold also needs the appropriate temperature needs oxygen.
Melinda asked bill holder to inspect their homes to see if he could find anything suspicious.
He started behind the refrigerator the location of the original water leak and under the first floor floor boards.
Push it on the suspect area and then attach it to a glass slide.
In the same time take a sterile cotton swab.
And lift some of the material off of that service.
With a sterile cotton swab put it in a sterile container sent it to the laboratory.
Dr David Strauss is a professor of microbiology and immunology at Texas Tech University.
I spent about a half an hour in the house and I was talking with bill Mr holder and I said to him turning and I said bill I don't feel very good so I got to get out of here and related just literally walked out the front door and and pretty much collapsed I lost any any ability to stand without without aid.
The samples were processed at Texas tech health sciences center.
Technicians there sterilize the slides then examined them under a high powered microscope.
The cotton swab samples were transferred to Petri dishes.
Then put in an incubator for five to seven days.
If there were spores present they would grow mold which could be examined under the microscope.
Most household molds are harmless.
But doctor Strauss found one type of mold in the home that was not harmless it was a toxic deadly mold known as stocky Botros.
Experts believe stocky Botros boards exist on many building materials.
As long as those materials stay dry the sports don't present a problem.
But when the spores get wet from a leaky roof for example.
Are in the dark moist environment and near up paper product like drywall and insulation the spores multiply quickly and they produce a potentially deadly poison called mycotoxins.
Mike attacks and are on the surface of the spores so when you inhale these fungal spores you're also taking the mycotoxins in your lines as well.
Later bill holder went back to conduct an airborne test.
Canisters placed throughout the house capture any airborne spores which might be present.
A short time later Melinda was notified of the results.
They informed us that it was literally everywhere and including in the apartment when we were living.
And for us to be a good idea to to leave.
To avoid the possibility of cross contamination the family was told to leave the grounds immediately and to take nothing with them.
At that point we got the heck out of Dodge.
It will laugh with literally nothing from that home because of cross contamination we didn't wanna bring a problem with us.
Buildings never get better by themselves in fact if you leave a building alone that has mold infestation it gets worse.
Linda and Ron the family's health problems would clear up once they left the house.
But they didn't.
But he's become almost.
I know he's seriously affected by this.
Ron is just really loves his son and on several occasions I would hear him talking about his son and he would say my son.
And stop because he didn't remember his son's name.
Ron'S memory problems forced him to resign from his firm.
Reese continued to suffer from asthma and learning disabilities.
Only Melinda came through without permanent health problems doctors have no idea why.
Toxic mold reproduces by shedding microscopic spores it can't be clean from services because to do so would release thousands of spores into the air instead each piece of contaminated building material has to be dismantled sealed and air tight plastic and carted away.
The question now was.
Linda and Ron moved out of their dream home following the scientific diagnosis that it was infested with the potentially deadly mold growing behind the walls and ceilings the couple says that the first time they noticed any water damage was the leak behind the refrigerator which the plumber had fixed.
The leak had caused extensive damage to the flooring throughout the area.
The couple says they wanted to repair the water damage right away.
But their insurance company said no.
We had to ask the insurance company in writing to allow us to begin repairs immediately and at least rip out some of the wet floor.
And the insurance company said that if I had made repairs during their investigation that I would lose coverage.
Scientific experts say the most household moles are harmless but with Starkey Botros the mold must be removed immediately since it's capable of spreading.
The cost to eliminate all of the stack of Botros and Ron and Melinda's home was originally estimated to be one million dollars.
The insurance company offered less than two hundred thousand dollars.
While the two sides tried to reach a settlement construction experts found thirteen additional plumbing leaks and one roof leak in the home causing even more stocky Botros contamination.
They kept wanting to investigate claims which were is their right and their duty to do that the problem is they would never allow us to begin making repairs the investigations and disputes over costs dragged on for two years by then experts concluded that the house and everything in it was so contaminated it was beyond repair.
To enter the house now Melinda has to don a special suit and respirator to protect yourself against the poisonous mold.
Experts recommended that the home be demolished.
Melinda and Ron filed suit against their insurance company for the financial loss of their property.
The last thing I wanted to do was have to suit my insurance company but they left me no choice.
The suit argued that the insurance company knew or should have known about the potentially dangerous effects of delaying repairs to water damage inside of homes and buildings.
Dr Michael ray sees more than a hundred fifty patients a year who suffer from exposure to toxic mold.
I concluded that Ron Allison was definitely affected by the mycotoxins which she was exposed to in the context of his living environment in the house that they lived in in addition to medical experts Rahn's attorney presented epidemiological studies showing the relationship between try caught the scene the toxin found in stocky Botros mold and mental functioning.
I was confident that we had found the kind of scientific information that will allow us to try this case to a jury yes.
Ron N. Mullen there were asking the insurance company for the cost of their home and property six million dollars.
The jury took two and a half days to come back with their verdict but it was not for the six million dollars Melinda and Ron ask for.
The jury awarded the couple.
Thirty two million dollars.
It was a great relate to me that the jury system work.
I was obviously relieved and hoped that they would not get away with what they had done.
The verdict in this case is now on appeal.
The home once a show places now sitting abandoned.
It'S been looked at numerous times.
Ron is learning to live with than impaired memory he enters his daily schedule into his hand held computer each morning and relies on its online to help them stay on track.
To make certain that people know their rights relative to water damage in their home Melinda created her own website.
Policy holders of America dot for.
It'S not just been a home that has been lost here in his van and the help of a little boy.
N. A. a very energetic workaholic man who has lost his identity and I don't want to see this happen to any other family I can promise you that all of those medical doctors and quality scientists that have been involved in our case are my heroes they are our heroes.
