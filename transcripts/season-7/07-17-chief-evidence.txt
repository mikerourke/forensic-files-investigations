In nineteen ninety six Seattle police faced an unusual challenge a severely wounded dog witnessed the murder of his two owners.
Could the dog identified the killers and if so how.
December ninth nineteen ninety six Seattle Washington.
It was going to be a special day for twenty two year old Raquel Rivera she was starting a new job as a receptionist in a downtown office nice you know the night before and she was really excited about it she was a little upset but she was worried about she was going to make it to work or not.
Raquel shared this house in Seattle South Park section with her long time boyfriend J. Johnson.
The two have been together since high school and we're talking about getting married.
I love J. he was a great guy he I I loved it.
He was very close to my daughter hello.
They were good for each other.
Just after dawn neighbors heard gunshots coming from the couple's home.
By about four five shots that I that I break and then maybe about six more shots.
When police arrived they found the front door off its hinges windows had been shattered by bullets.
Inside two bodies.
We have right now is that we found two people in the house of male or female boy shot.
We kill Rivera's mother who lived only a block away got the phone call every parent dreads when I got to the police and everybody they would let me in the apartment.
The bodies were positively identified as Raquel and J..
The couple's dog chief a six month old Labrador mix was also shocked.
I put my head around the corner so the dog was up against the door he was so obviously in pain he was growing there were blood traces all over the door where he is share blood against that wall I said let's get everybody out get animal control in here get the dog out.
This particular case would rate is probably the most severely injured dog that we've ever seen from a gun shot just by virtue the face said it received as such a full on final bullet right to the to the front of the nose.
Unfortunately despite undergoing emergency surgery the dog died.
An autopsy was performed it revealed the dog had been shot twice a non fatal shot in the shoulder and the bullet through his muscles you could liken it to running face first into the front end of it a truck bumper on that in terms of this given what we could see in terms of the the bullet trauma that that did to the front of his muzzle in his face.
The evidence told homicide investigators that the killer was searching for something.
Cabinets have been gone through doors have been opened the bad was tossed around so clearly the perpetrators wanted to find something not just eliminate the lives and witnesses there and they were after something.
There is no finesse to this it was a blood style attack they're in the shoot they shoot the dog they issued the orders of the dog Mr Johnson was shot several times in the lakes which is indicative of.
Someone trying to track information before.
The coroner would later described the murders as execution style killings.
The entire community was asking who would have killed this young couple who had no known enemies.
The only clues to the merger of J. Johnson number cal Rivera.
Eared foot print at the couple's front door and some nine millimeter shell casings.
Blood spatter was on the walls floor and on the inside of the door.
Police discovered that a fifteen year old boy living across the street in an apartment building had seen the shooting.
This person described them as small and males dressed in black very large men.
One wearing a bandanna.
The voice said the two men kicked open the front door shot the dog and then moved into the house.
The witness could no longer see them when he heard the firing.
He saw the dog he heard two shots and he heard the barking and then he heard the the docks.
The boys said the man left minutes later and drove away in a red Camaro driven by a third Samoan man.
There'S a large Samoan community in Seattle are law abiding hardworking people but with every group you've got a criminal element and the med tech made up a large portion of their criminal element they were a gang in the the sort of worst sense of the word.
Just three days earlier in Seattle's Chinatown there had been a similar shooting the victim Johnny pake survived the attack.
That being a Samoan mail.
Sitting in a red car.
Shell casings from the Chinatown shooting were compared to those taken from Jay and Rick calcified meant they matched.
Police now scouring the city looking for any Samoans driving a red Camaro.
Amazing they didn't have to look far.
On the afternoon following Jay and Rick cal's murder police noticed a red Camaro slowly driving past the murder scene.
Driving back to the crime scene hanging and checking things out is not an uncommon thing for a suspect to do it's the old returned to the scene of the crime.
Shea and it happens the driver of the red Camaro was Charles sneakers unknown member of the mad gang.
Although Niko denied any involvement in the shooting.
The fifteen year old I witness identified him as the driver of the getaway vehicle.
When threatened with the death penalty Niko finally told police what happened.
He said the motive was drugs the mad packed gang members heard the J. and Raquel had cocaine in their house and they decided to steal.
But after breaking in the couple said they had no change and then the man started.
Nicole identified the shooter is this twenty two year old Kenneth lay a little a lot of the the street name was Sabo clause and twenty four year old George to deal a final street name was Scooby.
Both were high ranking members of the map pack gang.
Both men denied any involvement in the shooting and said they had alibis.
A search of their apartment did not produce the nine millimeter murder weapon.
Smeared foot print on the front door could not be matched to either suspect.
And eight red stains found on the right sleeve of Sabo plus jacket was sent for DNA testing but it wasn't the victim's blood.
They'D get a result that is not human based because the genotype does not come back to our genes associated with a human being at all they then are scratching their heads heads with Hey what's going on here.
In fact investigators weren't sure what it was.
With no forensic evidence to tie the suspects to the crime Seattle police feared a conviction might be impossible.
As J. Johnson and Raquel Rivera were laid to rest side by side in a Seattle cemetery their families demanded justice.
To decipher exactly what happened at the crime scene investigator Keith needed to distinguish between the dog's blood spatter and that of J. and recap.
I requested to my surgeon Cyndi Tolman that an officer follow the dog to the vet and draw blood from the dog immediately.
Of my thinking at the time was to differentiate between the human blood at the scene and the dog blood.
The blood spatter and bullet casings in the apartment and the eyewitness account of the fifteen year old boy who lived across the street gave police a rough idea of what had happened.
After the intruders kicked open the door.
Then the man went into the bedroom.
They took J. into an adjoining room and shot him in the leg while demanding the couple's cocaine.
One of the men left to shoot once more.
And when she said the couple never had any drugs they killed him.
Despite his shoulder wound again tried to protect his owners and ran into the bedroom the killers.
But why wasn't the victim's blood on the suspect's clothes.
Investigators say both J. and Raquel were shot from a distance and we're also wearing clothes pajamas and T. shirts which absorb the blood spatter.
But with chief there was nothing to absorb the blood.
Who is short haired and had it not long hairs around the muzzle or face or neck area so any kind of serious wound causing a lot of blood is obviously going to spill or spray or go off it's not going to cling to the cold because there's such a short smooth coat is going to roll right off.
She was very close to Kenneth when he was shot and we know also that cheap shot in the muscle area.
Now police discovered the possible key to the mysterious red stains on the right sleeve of Sabo clause Jack.
Detectives o'keefe and myself decided to see if we're dealing with a non human source namely about.
So with that we needed to.
Seek out laboratories that do DNA testing would non humans.
And through some research we came upon a lab in the Davis California headed by Dr joy Alverson.
Dr joy how person is an expert in investigating the parentage of world class show dogs.
Championship caliber show dogs can be worth thousands of dollars and where there's money there's often corruption.
Dishonest breeders engaged in a practice known as litter loading where pops from inferior dogs are mixed in with pops from champion dogs and sold at inflated prices.
Knowledgeable buyers now analyzed the DNA profiles of their new pops in order to confirm their dogs championship parentage.
Dog DNA is exactly like human DNA the only difference would be we use a different set of DNA markers but in terms of its chemical properties and the way it it behaves with these testing procedures it's exactly the same.
Police suspected the red spots on Sabo clause right sleeve came from the victim's dog chief.
Dr Halvorson cut out a piece of the sleeve with the red stains on it and analyzed it with the PCR based DNA test a little piece of that fabric is taken and put into a tube and various buffers and so on are added to it blood cells will come off the fabric into the liquid and then the.
Various treatments are done to extract the DNA from that.
Results consistent with the blood from a dog.
What was the blood from the victims dog chief.
Dr Halvorson compared the DNA markers from the blood on the suspect's sleeve to the blood taken from chief during his autopsy.
Was a perfect match.
The blood on Sabo clause right sleeve was the blood of Jesus.
Prosecutor Kym Bradshaw knew he'd face a challenge from defense lawyers.
We were unable to find any other case homicide case in the country where canine based DNA had been admitted into evidence.
The defense lawyers not only would challenge the admissibility of the canine DNA evidence they described it is hocus pocus and boldly predicted their clients would walk free.
The two gang members charged with killing J. Johnson and Raquel Rivera were facing first degree murder charges.
Prosecutors not only have the teenaged eyewitness from across the street who identified the two in a police lineup.
They also had DNA evidence from the victim's dog on Kenneth lay a little a lot of the easily.
Also on his sleeve.
They were not human.
But they were compared to chiefs here and found to be consistent.
This wasn't as good as the DNA evidence certainly wouldn't hurt the prosecution's case.
The main suspect Kenneth lay a little a lot of the E. became so disruptive he had to be restrained in a wheel chair for the eight week trial.
He pointed to jog the family members saying he'd never get convicted.
Prosecutors presented their theory of how the murders were committed based on the blood spatter evidence.
Prosecutors believe that the suspects opened J. and Raquel store and immediately were confronted by the dog.
After killing both Rachel and J. G. once again tried to talk his.
G. four shot at point blank range the blowback blood spatter landed on cans white sleeve.
When presented with the DNA evidence linking cans jacket to the dock the judge ruled that legally the animal DNA was the same as human DNA.
If the testing was the same.
And so was its value as evidence we took advantage of the fact that the sciences is no different than the human testing that's done now and in the friends a community and there's really no there's nothing groundbreaking about it it's just a different set of DNA markers developed for dogs.
It was the first time animal DNA was used in the United States as evidence in a criminal case.
Kenneth lay a little Lawley he took the stand and said he had an explanation for the dog blood on his sleeve.
He told the jurors that a few nights prior to the murders he was at a dance club in the coma got into a fist fight with another man there and that that there by explains the blood.
that did give me an opportunity to ask him whether the man he was fighting with had hit him with the dog.
Any really couldn't explain.
After twelve hours of deliberation the jury sentenced both man to life in prison without parole.
Kenneth lay a little a lot of the E. laughed as the verdict was read.
The last laugh was reserved for chief the victims courageous dog at a few puns about our case in chief that the third victim here chief assay exceedingly important to our case and you know we're grateful to that but we're also the sound a little hokey very grateful to the scientific community for making a contribution to justice and that's exactly what happened here.
J. in rich L. had bought chief for protection little did they know that he would someday bring their killers to justice.
Piece of evidence the one victim who could never speak ended up providing perhaps the most eloquent of testimony and that was from the the DNA profile that clearly placed defendant Li welat Li at the crime scene.
The verdict brought small satisfaction to recalcitrant there who now makes a point of keeping the dog around the house.
The room the child she raised by herself his dad for no reason leaving a great void in her life no amount of justice can ever fill.
We were so close very nice she was growing up just turned nine.
What I learned from this case.
Is that if it's alive it has DNA.
Detectives can use DNA.
In their cases in ways that we never thought of ten years ago.
There is plant DNA there is animal DNA every domestic animal has a DNA data bank now the department of interior as a laboratory where they do DNA on wild species.
Just from my own experience of owning animals I mean I'm sure if I looked on my clothing right now I'd find some animal hairs and if somebody kidnapped me and put me in the trunk of their car they probably a few of those hairs would end up on the trunk of their car so if if someone's being alert and thinking about these things I think are valuable sources of evidence.
And so it's a constant reminder for investigators to be vigilant in your approach to any sort of crime scene and to be quite open minded and imagine tip about what application you can do as far as what science is available because to a large degree science is leading the way we got to keep on.
