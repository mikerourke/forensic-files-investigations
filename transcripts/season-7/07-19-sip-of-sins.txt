In Wichita falls Texas.
He'S had four unsolved murders the worst crime spree in the small towns history.
For more than a decade.
Killers successfully eluded police.
But the discarded coffee cups in a trash bin solve the mystery.
On January nineteenth nineteen eighty five Tony Gibbs a twenty three year old nurse disappeared after working the night shift at Wichita General Hospital.
The car was found abandoned on a deserted road not far from the hospital.
The roller coaster of emotions you go through it's just unbelievable it's it's it's like a horrible dream that doesn't go away.
Four weeks later a Texas electric worker found Tony's body in a deserted field outside of town along U. S. route two eighty one.
A hundred feet away was an old bus.
It appeared she had been stabbed in the bus then crawled out into the field looking for help.
Until this terrible thing and she had the world by the tail she really did.
Almost immediately police said a suspect.
Twenty four year old Danny Lawson was seen riding his motorcycle in a field near where Tony's body was found.
Laughlin worked in town as a male stripper.
When asked to take a polygraph test he failed.
He'D gone into one of the officers offices and then started making comments like he knew about the murder he placed himself there.
Investigators also learned that Laughlin knew Tony Gibbs he had met her a few weeks earlier at a local night club.
And then he made some comments about knowing where the where the field was and where she was found.
Semen collected at Tony's autopsy was compared to Laughlin's DNA the results were inconclusive.
Danny Lawson was charged with Tony Gibson merger.
With no forensic evidence linking Laughlin to the crime.
Securus presented their circumstantial case against him during the trial.
After two days of deliberations the jury was deadlocked.
Could not reach a verdict on guilt innocence and so a mistrial was declared any missteps going dismissed.
Since only one of the twelve jurors believe Lawson was guilty prosecutors decided not to retry the case.
Sixteen months later there was another murder this time a twenty one year old waitress Tina Kimbrough.
Tina was found dead on the sofa in her apartment.
At the autopsy tiny fibers were discovered in our lawns an indication she had been suffocated.
Those fibers matched up hello from herself.
In this case there were no signs of sexual assault it's been sixteen years but it's been.
Sixteen days and sixteen hours and sixteen.
Centuries you know it's just inside pain has never been here and it's like if the phone rang in ten minutes you know it could possibly be her.
Neighbors in the apartment complex said they saw a man leaving Tina's apartment about five hours before her body was discovered.
The man was described as Caucasian six feet two inches tall with dark hair wearing a baseball cap.
Danny Lawson was not a suspect in this case since he didn't match the description.
A few days later.
Police got their first break.
A man in Galveston Texas Ferron ward trip called police to say he had some important information about Tina Kimbrough's murder.
What did ward Britney no about a murder that took place over four hundred miles away.
Shortly after Tina Kimbrough's murder Ferron ward read four hundred miles away in Galveston Texas call police with some information.
Margaret was a high school dropout who worked at menial jobs and had a history of drug and alcohol abuse he claimed to have met Tina Kim wrote in a bar where she worked.
War drifted meditate killed the reason Tina reminded him of his ex wife ended their marriage shortly before the murder.
Rains and all the violence was occurring I saw her eyes I saw her face.
I screamed how much I hated her what brought about that angers the child and what developed it as an adult I really don't know he does blame Gianna his ex wife for a lot of the things that had happened to him that John I didn't understanding that China wouldn't go to work he's more reluctant to place any blame on himself.
Police believe that wardrobe confessed because he knew he was spotted leaving the apartment and feared it was only a matter of time before he was caught.
In any event.
One more trip pleaded guilty to Tina Kimbrough's murder and was sentenced to thirty five years in prison.
When I was in prison and I got off drugs and alcohol got some clear thinking going on in some of my emotions had subsided that's when I started making the decisions that.
I was gonna come out better than I went in.
While in prison war trip obtained his high school diploma and discovered Christianity.
Tina'S father believe that wardrobe would spend all of thirty five years in prison but he was wrong.
In thirteen months a notify me that he's up for parole and it just you know it just scared me to death I made just.
For ten years Robert Kimbrough used every means at his disposal to ensure that Ferron ward reps remain behind bars.
But despite the wishes of Tina's family wardrobe was released on parole after serving only eleven years of a thirty five year sentence.
You know the victims had no rights I had to tilt ferry and then you got total responsibility of why I can't be a grandfather.
And I hate you for it I mean I hate to hear every day for.
Wardrobe went to live in only Texas a small farming community just outside of fort worth their wardrobe have the support of his mother father and eight siblings.
He got a job at the only door in screen company and vowed to start his life over.
Very nice man a fine upstanding man.
How to trust him with my kids I stole it I still have that much respect for wardrobe was an active member of the Hamilton street church of Christ where he taught Sunday school he also remarried.
Back in Wichita falls district attorney Barry Marco had other concerns.
There were a number of unsolved murders in his jurisdiction.
Still on song was the merger of Tony Gibbs and there were two other unsolved murders.
A year before Tony gives murder another nurse twenty one year old Terry sams had just returned home from work when someone knocked on her front door.
And forced his way inside.
She'S trying to ward off the knife that he is wheeled in she is fighting so hard so ferociously for her laugh that he ties he cuts the cord and ties her hands behind her back.
Terry sins was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death.
She lives to probably two to four minutes after those injuries I can't imagine I cannot imagine what that young girl must have thought during her final moments of her life.
Monetary same issue was a bloody fingerprint.
And a semen sample was preserved for future DNA testing.
There had been a few suspects in the murder but nothing definitive.
And a year later.
Tragedy struck twenty one year old Ellen blouse as she walked to her car around midnight after leaving work at the subs and suds restaurant Hey just for.
Ellen was forced to drive to a deserted field on the outskirts of town where she was strangled.
Body was left on a grassy embankment.
The assailant drove her car back to town and left it on a dark street.
Ellen'S body was found days later so badly decomposed by the heat she could be identified only through dental records it was impossible to determine whether she had been raped.
For fourteen years these three murders have gone unsolved.
So very much asked his lead investigator John little to take a fresh look at these cold cases.
On a hunch mica asked the forensics lab to compare the DNA of the semen recovered from Tony Gibbs and Terry sins.
We received word that they were in fact the semen from the same perpetrator and so we knew then that we handed them a serial murder.
No one made this connection because these three cases have been investigated by three different law enforcement agencies with little communication between them.
At least now John little Neil he was looking for only one killed.
But after eleven years he knew it wouldn't be easy.
When John little look through the case files of the three unsolved murders in Wichita falls Texas he made an interesting discovery.
When fair on war trip was in custody for Tina Kimbrough's murder a policeman asked him if he knew Helen Blau who had been murdered just a few months earlier.
But that lead was never proceed.
They could have come up with a suspect as me being a suspect at this time if they would just maybe paid a little bit more tension.
And little found more evidence linking more dress.
Ellen blouse best friend Janie ball live just down the hall from one and the coincidences didn't stop there.
This bar was a block down from where Terry sailor was killed on bell street.
So and then when I saw that in the file you know and there's two different agencies investigate Nance and knowing that they brought in and put it together well and really snap together for me at that point.
Little also learned that wardrobe was a janitor at the same hospital as Tony Gibbs at the time of her murder.
That made a connection to her and work with her now she's another victim their car was abandoned in the same neighborhood where wardrobe lived so he decided to go to only Texas hoping to collect war drips DNA since police had semen from the murders wardrobe had been living there since his release from prison in nineteen ninety six.
Little spent weeks taking out the factory where wardrobe work hoping to collect anything that would reveal his DNA profile.
If we get a sample from Mr ward I wanted to be a situation where he did in fact abandon any interest in the attic so that there wouldn't be any search and seizure problems.
From across the street.
Little noticed that more drift through his paper copy into a nearby trash barrel.
Little seized the opportunity.
There were still some coffee in the bottom of this kind of.
And it had cheese cracker crumbs on the drinking around this.
The couple was immediately sent to the forensic lab for DNA testing.
Manager Judy Floyd examine the cop for skin cell.
She noticed the cracker crumbs were still on the comp and felt sure she could retrieve DNA.
I saw the Cup with a sterile cotton swab in order to pick up epithelial cells and then it was the straw that I actually used for the extraction of DNA.
Floyd then compare the DNA from the coffee Cup to the DNA from the semen collected from two of the victims Terry sams and Tony Gibbs when I observe the complete profile that I had obtained from the cells from the Cup that Mister Warner could use I could see that his profile was an exact match to the profiles from the crime scene.
To find out how often this DNA profile would occur in the general population Judy Floyd perform what is called a DQ alpha test which is of particular location on chromosome number six.
Judy Floyd discovered more drips DQ alpha type was extremely rare.
It was a one point three four and that is just not found very frequently at all in the population this particular typing was rare enough that combined with all the other genetic types in his profile that particular profile would be expected to occur only once in the world's population.
She also remembers calling John little with the news I knew he was jumping up and down in the air I can almost hear his heels clicking together he was to say the least aesthetic.
Meanwhile the Austin Texas crime lab was able to lift the bloody print on Terry Sam schuh and compare it to war drips fingerprints.
So far down on the third digit almost into the palm that animation can really just set their work with the.
To get the printer and nowhere was that you could did it take a set of prints and miss it every time but it was clearly more drips print.
there was powerful piece of evidence he ripped shoes off over and had blood on his hands when he grabbed her shoes to pull more.
Terron ward drip was arrested and during questioning revealed one last piece of information.
Police knew nothing about.
After fifteen long years the families of Terry Sam's Tony Gibbs and Ellen Blau were within inches of justice when fair on wardrobe was arrested for their mergers.
And when he was confronted with the DNA evidence he confessed.
I don't think I'll ever shared a room with somebody who could have been colder.
Wardrobe didn't realize he was sitting next to the man who tracked.
Two months after Tony Gibson murder Ferron wardrobe told police he left Wichita falls and went to fort worth Texas.
He met Deborah Taylor a wife and mother of two in a neighborhood bar.
Deborah had been there with her husband but he was tired and had left a bar a few hours earlier.
In the parking lot with Deborah refused his advances he killed her.
Portrait dump Taylor's body at remote construction site.
Workers found it one week later.
Debra'S husband can remain the suspect for fourteen years although he was never charged it just destroyed his life his own family turned against him dampers family turned against him France everyone believes they can tailor had killed his wife Deborah thank Mr Warner should be very glad.
Did these guys got it before I did.
The new DNA testing also had another benefit.
It exonerated Danny Laughlin who had been tried for Tony Gibbs murder but not convicted.
Unfortunately he didn't live long enough to hear about it.
He was killed three years earlier in an automobile accident.
On October fourth nineteen ninety nine nearly fifteen years after he committed these crimes Ferron ward trip played guilty to murder.
And was sentenced to death by lethal injection.
I never once thought I got away with it I knew that I had left behind detectives looked at all the evidence that was collected all the interviews and stuff of course my name was that mayor in nineteen eighty six is like it was in nineteen ninety nine and one of those individuals didn't recognize that is is still confusing to me this day.
I really was a serial killer.
Mistakes were made but the mall in the one that was not made was to quit or give up we never did they have.
