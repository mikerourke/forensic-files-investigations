In nineteen ninety nine a minister's wife was found dead in an overflowing bathtub in her home in South Dakota.
cryptic suicide note left questions about her state of mind and sands of time.
For rent six science provided those answers.
This peaceful house of god is the United Presbyterian church.
Each Sunday morning it opens its doors to the faithful of we'll see South Dakota.
The town is no more than a handful of dirt roads just off highway fourteen.
And several farms out on the blustery prairie.
The pastor of this congregation was Reverend bill Guthrie he and his wife Sharon lived in the parsonage next door to the church.
He was a very strong minister probably the most intelligent man when it came to the Bible.
Sharon Guthrie also helped her husband with church duties we should have children's message it was before the sermon telling a story and and sign in with a package of Smarties to go back and sit down login this morning.
The Guthrie's were looking forward to the wedding of their second daughter Jenna Lou.
Would never see that day.
Just after dawn on may fourteenth nineteen ninety nine reference three called an ambulance he had discovered his wife unconscious in the bath tub she's.
When emergency personnel arrived they performed CPR and restarted her heart and.
In the ambulance she was placed on a respirator but she never regained consciousness.
Despite the best medical care in the area emergency room doctors could find no signs of brain activity.
The next day.
When the sheriff past reference got three about the incident he said his wife was fine when he left home to go to the church to say his daily prayers.
When he was leaving the house to go to the church's way for stronger bathwater whiskey.
He said he went to the church was Sir maybe ten minutes.
Came back to the house.
Guthrie said he tried to pull her body out of the top but was unsuccessful.
All he could do was into the tub and turned her body over before calling the ambulance we just figured we were dealing with some sort of an accident you know or this lady had had a seizure a heart attack or something while she was taking a bath.
Dr Brad Randall performed the autopsy and found no signs of trauma or illness.
Fortunately the emergency room personnel had taken blood samples when she was first brought to the hospital which the pathfinder just could analyze.
So we had samples from a living individual rather than a dead individual which toxicology and dead people is a little more difficult and working with an actual living individual so we were lucky to have those samples to work with.
The samples revealed three medications insurance system to what medication she had been prescribed and we're in relatively low concentrations but there was one drug in her system she had not been prescribed.
The most important drug was a drug call to massive Pam which is a benzo days of pain that was present in very high concentrations it is a drug not commonly associated with lethal overdoses.
Temazepam is a sedative the level in Sharon Guthrie system would definitely render someone unconscious.
Although Randall could not be certain how many capsules were taken.
Probably greater than five to ten somewhere in that category or more.
Dr Randall listed the cause of death as drowning with the temazepam overdose a contributing factor.
The manner of death was undetermined was it suicide.
Three weeks after Sharon Guthrie's death her daughter Janel who decided to go ahead with their wedding as planned I talked to my dad about it I talked to family about it asked what they thought we should do and I talk to my husband about it and we decided that my mom would have wanted us to do it my dad actually perform the ceremony.
Meanwhile detective Jerry Lindbergh was assigned to investigate Sharon Guthrie's death unfortunately the scene of the drowning had not been preserved for evaluation the result of her being live and taken to the hospital out of town.
Laces left open hello there was was destroyed because people came in the good neighbor thing cleaned up brought lunches and so on.
But investigators discovered the source of the temazepam and Sharon system it had been prescribed for her husband bills.
Still got three suspected his wife accidentally ingested the pills while sleep walking.
But none of her three daughters recall Sharon ever sleep walking and investigators found something suspicious.
A few weeks before Sharon's death bill Guthrie filled his original prescription for canasta Pam at one pharmacy and then went to a second pharmacy told them he had lost his first prescription and got a second one.
Another inconsistency was bills clothing on the morning of Sharon's death.
Bill told the sheriff he had tried to lift his wife out of the bathtub when he first found her.
Yeah witnesses said that his clothing was completely dry with the ambulance crew arrived.
If you spend any time at all wrestling around with with what individual you're going to get wet.
And investigators learned.
Astor had some secrets.
Probably part of the reason I came up here is because of that I knew her from when they were at their previous church I knew my mom didn't like her.
But I never really knew why.
Guthrie'S mistress was a leading member of this former church in Nebraska the affair continued even after Guthrie moved to South Dakota.
When Guthrie took the job and we'll see he told the church council that he needed to return to Nebraska for medical counseling because he was impotent.
On some occasions even paid his mileage.
And you never want to counsel he was going back to continue this fairly.
But eventually Guthrie's mistress grew dissatisfied with their clandestine affair.
Basically she needs her where's it all you do is have sex and he would stay in a motel room they can go out to eat.
Can go to a movie and she was tired of that and she wanted something more so she put some pressure on him and he never did anything in it finally in January she broke up with.
And there was no evidence that build Guthrie was important not for what his girlfriend does he apparently he was able to perform adequately and did on frequent occasions.
Investigators now considered build Guthrie a suspect in his wife's death.
But adultery and prescription fraud is one thing but the merger is another.
Easton listed bills oldest daughter Suzanne to find out if her father played a role in her mother's death.
She agreed to confront her father with a hidden microphone.
Plead as a daughter.
For him to just be honest with me.
I need to ask you had an affair.
Did you hear that from everybody that.
Dan and I need to know the truth in all of this.
What do you think that I did.
I don't know anything about the medicine that's missing.
everything from his affair to getting the medication.
In late July investigators confiscated the church computer in order to see the email correspondence between the pastor and his lover in Nebraska.
The emails revealed nothing.
But police wondered if there was information hidden somewhere on the computer's hard drive.
To find out they turn to an expert in the new field of computer forensics.
After Sharon Guthrie suspicious drowning police confiscated the Guthrie's computer to see if it contained possible evidence.
Joe Robbins is an expert in the field of computer forensics.
He says that most of us know very little about how computers really work the most common misconception is that you can delete data by asking your program or your operating system to delete it and that it's gone.
That'S because hitting the delete key simply marks that material and the memory it uses as available for use in the future.
There is some residual traces of their existence in that space and so the equivalent in the computer system is that there is often a residual indication that you were there it's now trace evidentiary value is is tremendous if it's found before the space gets re rented or released or in the computer reused by a new file.
Computer information trail may also show when files are created downloaded or added to it.
Robbins use special software to search the memory for anything related to the mass of.
He discovered there had been numerous internet searches about sleeping pills just a month before Sharon died.
Someone had also downloaded numerous articles about to mess up.
Which had been found in Sharon's system.
Temazepam is the only sleeping pill that comes in a capsule form that you can take apart and has power inside so it's easy to take apart and put it into something.
And Robbins found other information on the hard drive that he thought might be of value.
I didn't know exactly how when.
She died so I called Mike warning us and I said why and he goes well there seems to be a lot of information in here batch of accidents and I then told him that.
She drowned in a bathtub.
The searches were done the month before Sharon died with the last one completed on April twenty seventh.
The searches were done in April and she died in may.
On April twenty ninth Guthrie asked his doctor for a prescription for him as a pan and filled it at the two different pharmacies.
The prescription was filled again on may twelfth and thirteenth.
On may fourteenth I have a lead drug Sharon Guthrie drowned in her top.
Based on the computer evidence bill Guthrie was arrested and charged with murder the prosecution theorized that Guthrie wanted out of this marriage but feared a divorce would jeopardize his position as a pastor.
So he looked for ways to make her death look like an accident.
And the way he may have done it was to laser favorite drank chocolate milk with an overdose of sedatives.
Prosecutors believe that on the morning of her death bill Guthrie put the temazepam in his wife's chocolate milk.
After the drugs went into effect he placed his wife now unconscious into the tub filled it with water.
And let her drown.
I thought we had a pretty good circumstantial case but all our evidence is circumstantial.
But in general Simpson still wasn't convinced that her father was a merger.
She says her mother took an overdose of Benadryl an allergy medication a few weeks earlier and required medical attention.
I thought it was accidental I thought that.
She had done it before with the Benadryl she done it before some herbal stuff I thought she probably.
Yeah I did it again just to just get some attention.
People who filled church pews to hear bill Guthrie preach now filled the wooden benches of the beetle county courthouse.
Spanked everyday people get here sometimes seven o'clock in the morning get a seat.
Prosecutor Michael Moore was confident of this case then more got the shock of his life the defense introduced a suicide note from Sharon Guthrie.
It is murder trial.
Bill dot three revealed that several weeks after her death he found a suicide note from his wife Sharon.
For some unexplained reason it was hidden in a liturgy in the church office a bunch of things race through your head you know you're upset you're shocked.
The note was typed on the computer but was on song.
It was dated may thirteenth nineteen ninety nine the day before Sharon died and a dress to her daughter.
Dear Suzanne I'm sorry I ruined your wedding your dad told me about your concerns of my interfering in Jena lose and the possibility I might ruin hers I will be there so put your mind at ease you will understand after the wedding is don.
I love you all mom.
The note referred to a minor incident that occurred at Suzanne's wedding a few years earlier.
Prosecutor Mike Moore asked his computer forensic expert Judd Robbins to re examine the hard drive of the church's computer to see if he could find any trace of the suicide note.
But he found not.
An individual rights a suicide note and they are truly contemplating suicide they have a tendency to perspire using an hydrant is a good the agent because it does look for amino acids which comes from sweat.
Team from household iron accelerated the process revealing numerous fingerprints.
For what reason I don't know.
Bill Guthrie said he had given the no directly to his lawyer.
It was impossible to tell whether the prince was Sharon's since she had never been fingerprinted even at her autopsy.
But if the note was typed on a computer and it didn't come from the computer in the church.
Where did it come from.
Police discovered that got three on the second computer which he had given to his daughter and son in law shortly before his trial.
They now turn it over to the state's attorney.
The only thing we really wanted was the truth.
To know exactly what happened.
whether it be proving his innocence for.
Proving his guilt was that was up to them John Robbins examines the hard drive from the second computer.
The main text was missing but it had the same closing line as the suicide note and had the same date may thirteenth.
Both documents have the same typographical error no space between the comma and the year.
So we had margins the same we had fonts the same we had words the same.
The file had been created in August three months after Sharon die.
Robbins also found evidence that the note was written by bill Guthridge.
This suicide note was constructed in interspaced inter twined fashion with several of his sermons in the month of August so that I could construct a timeline of working on sermon working on suicide no working on sermons.
I think at that point we realized that he had done something they had done this and that he was guilty for this.
I thank the jury would see what I was seeing that.
This was this guy's last ditch effort to get away with killing his wife and we caught him at it.
The jury convicted William Guthrie of first degree murder he was sentenced to life in prison.
After the trial Sharon Guthrie's body was exhumed so that she could be re buried in her native Nebraska.
Sharon'S fingerprints were finally obtained Cynthia Orton compared Sharon springs to those on the suicide note.
They did not match.
But the question that leaves me with this whose fingerprints are on that document.
For now that question remains a mystery.
The owner Suzanne believes her father is guilty.
Despite the computer forensic evidence her sister Jenna little believes her father is innocent and stays in contact with him through phone calls and letters.
I lost my mother my father and my sister's throughout office.
And I lost my within a year.
The sisters no longer speak.
The prosecutor says forensic science solve this case without it he says bill dot three would be a free man.
Without those sciences you don't have a case if you don't have the path ology is finding drugs if you don't have the computer expert finding that stuff on the computer you don't have a case.
