What happens when a healthy middle aged woman suddenly collapses and dies in medical science can find the cause of death.
Later a second Rancic look discovered evidence that had been right under their noses the entire time.
Dana point California just sixty miles south and a world away from Los Angeles is a haven for those seeking a quiet Oceanside lifestyle.
In nineteen eighty eight it was home to Janet and Richard Overton and their seventeen year old son Eric.
Sixty year old Richard was a successful computer consultant and part time professor.
Thirty six year old Janet was a member of the local school board.
She was such a genuinely nice person smiling and and had good things to say.
The Overton lived on a tranquil cul de sac.
After nineteen years of marriage they seem to be a classic example of when opposites attract while Janet was outgoing and high school educated Richard held a PhD and was much more reserved.
He was always the loner and I don't I understand that he graduated high school after three years he was editor of of one of these campus newspapers yes I said it was a very smart man.
Janet was passionate about her work on the school board a job she took seriously at one point she served as president but our number one priority was her son.
She took such pleasure in him and I know that one of her goals was to hand him his diploma when he walked across the stage graduating from Dana hills high school.
January twenty fourth Janet Anderson Eric packed up the family plan to spend the day on a yacht with some friends.
Before leaving the house Janet collapsed told his father who immediately called for an ambulance.
By the time emergency personnel arrived Janet was unconscious.
When they got to the hospital.
An autopsy found no indication of how she died.
They did not find anything that they were comfortable calling the cause of death or even close.
Surprisingly Janet's medical records indicated she had made sixty there's different doctors clinics and hospitals in the last year there was just an amazing amount of work done on the disease Janet over.
In the previous year because she had been very sick and had been to all sorts of special clinics working things out they didn't find anything.
Janet had complained of a number of various ailments from nausea to skin irritations the general pain.
She was walking very slowly and had a keen helper walk and was.
Really looking miserable.
Here to the medical examiner Janet's death was as mysterious as or other medical problems over the past year.
That would have remained a mystery I did not Dan telephone call about an incident fourteen years earlier.
Virgin'S death at the young age of forty six was officially listed as pending investigation which is another way of saying unknown.
For the next six months there was no further investigation into Janet's death.
That is until the local sheriff's department received a telephone call from Dorothy Boyer who was once married to Richard Overton Dorothy had heard about Janet's death and had a story to tell about Richard's pass already said she divorced Richard when he found out that he was a big mess he was married to another woman at the same time he was married to her and had children with both women.
Any changes to our souls and to see the two women he consistently had trouble relationships with women all this adult life which went to his first marriage the bigamous marriage with Caroline Hutchinson and his third marriage with Janet there was a definite pattern there when the couple divorced Darcy gained custody of their children and took possession of their house which infuriated Richard almost immediately started began to suffer from skin lesions nausea and pain the same symptoms that plague Janet over ten.
One day after their divorce Richard visited darn thing to discuss some issues relating to their children.
Dorothy noticed an unusual odor coming from her milk.
Scientists discovered large amounts of selenium what type of poison.
The accused Richard of placing the selenium in her mail during his visit.
When confronted with the evidence Richard confessed.
He refused to press charges against Richard had to admit yes I did do this he was sent into anger counseling when he came out of anger counseling he made another attempt which he denied and that was one Dorothy confronted him and just told him you make any more attempts on me or anybody in my family and I'm gonna have you taken away in handcuffs and from then on he backed off he didn't do anything to Dorothy after hearing this news lieutenant Carney wanted to exhume Janet over to this body for another autopsy.
There was a problem.
Janet Overton had been cremated.
The colleges Paul said to which only option was to re examine Janet's blood and tissue samples left over from the autopsy.
When he tested those samples for selenium.
Non present despite the setback in fasting Gators pressed on and soon discovered that Janet had a Secret Life of a run.
She had been involved in a long time affair with bill Dawson someone she worked with on the school board and do all the yard she was going on the day she died Mr Dawson was very forthright honest he knows career was on the line by revealing this Mister Dawson was also adamant that he had nothing to do with Janet's death.
In Janet's home police discovered one hundred thirty three computer desks and dozens of diaries written by Richard Overton some written in Russian and Spanish.
If you read the diaries and read the diskettes.
It tells a whole different story of Richard overturns relationship with Jan the relationship Richard pointed out to me at my time of interview of there having a loving relationship.
the bonds of love were strong was totally.
Inconsistent with what he wrote in his diaries.
I opened up the diary for January twenty fourth the hand written diary of January twenty fourth is the date that Janet died he had cut the page out of the diary.
Many of the disks contained portions of documents that had been deleted.
The disks were sent to a computer forensic examination firm for analysis.
When material in a computer document is deleted it's not actually deleted instead the material is identified on the desk has space available to be re used if needed.
Space is needed to lead the Terrio is still there.
The recovered information from Richard's hard drive revealed that Richard Neal of his wife's affair with bill Dawson and was angry about.
Overall is writing chronicled a deeply troubled relationship.
Three one week before her death he made an entry that said the love hate relationship between Jan and I has turned to pure hate I will deal with this soon.
Passages of the hand written diaries have been covered with corrections.
The suspected incriminating information might be underneath to find some way to see underneath the deletions the diaries were sent to the forensic slack.
For us to look at and was curious if we could use some type of a light source that was available to identification bureau to eliminate that information.
Black used to it a decade ago was a new and untested piece of equipment a laser.
The process worked.
Of those entries corroborated the severity of the problems in the overtones marriage D. Overton marriage was a marriage that slowly deteriorated over there a period of time and then quickly deteriorated to the point where there was no one.
contact between Richard and Janet over ten there's separate bedrooms they took meals separately she confided to a couple of her friends said as soon as they are graduating from high school he was out of there and he knew it too.
The dire is very important because it showed motive we saw the relationship between Jan and Richard on a daily basis there with everything listed in these diaries and when I say everything I mean everything.
Richard was somehow involved in Janet's death the diaries gave no hint of how he killed her.
Scientists suffered a major setback when they could find no trace of the police and selenium and Janet overturns tissue samples.
Years earlier Richard Overton admitted putting selenium and his ex wife's drink because he was angry about the financial terms of their divorce.
The sex life never filed charges but this admission of an earlier poisoning prompted forensic scientists to take a second look at Janet overturns tissue samples.
Toxicologist made a startling discovery.
The order of cyanide didn't really overpower me but it just jumped out I was two or three feet away and there was just no question this was this was cyanide and large amounts only one person in three has the ability to detect cyanide in this way.
But he would need more proof than his nose.
Sedgwick perform pression blue test a sample of Janet's stomach contents were mixed with water and sodium hydroxide then after reading some terrorist cell fate the mixture was heated to boiling.
As in the next year would turn key Russian blue.
The result was positive.
Cyanide in Janet's stomach meant she had ingested it shortly before her death.
And toxicologists found something else traces of cyanide in Janet's brain tissue.
An indication she had ingested the cyanide on previous occasions.
Cyanide was found in trace amounts in some horrible and prescription medicines that Janet overt and had been taking to see if any of Janet's herbal treatments could have produced the cyanide centric tested the substance issue was taken by ground them up I tried blending in anyway I could to bring out any cyanide that might be might possibly involve from these compounds and then I smell them and I tested them chemically and I follow cyanide in any of the compound.
Another obstacle was reports that cyanide can be created in blood samples after death.
Before heading to trial.
Security is needed to know whether the storage process because the cyanide in Janet's tissues and wanted testing done by an internationally known expert Michael Scotland Yard because Scotland Yard dealt with more quickly than we did here in the state so I called up and I said do you know of an expert that deals in finite that would now exclusively about cyanide and I was referred to Brian Ballantine one of the foremost experts in the world on Sunday night.
The level of cyanide found in Janet's blood sample seven months after her death was two micrograms per one hundred milliliters of blood.
While that amount was consistent with other fatal cases of cyanide poisoning Ballantine's personal standard was much higher.
He studied the storage conditions in the lab containing Janet's tissues and mathematically determined cyanides conversion and evaporation rates when this was complete Dr Ballantyne New York at the Sinai den Janet system was the result of foul play.
The quick acting cyanide to kill Janet had to be administered minutes before her death.
This fact eliminated Janet's lover bill Dawson has the killer since he had an alibi that he was on his boat at the time of Janet's death.
But if Richard Overton had given his wife the cyanide.
Where did he get it wasn't long before investigators discovered the answer.
Home the gold and silver mine and the land in this house which contains cyanide since it's used in mining operations to extract precious metal from the role this individual was.
Frequent in these these mines.
And while he was gone Richard would go over to his house.
The person's email and the animals.
Prosecutors could not prove Richard had access to the murder weapon and had opportunity and motive.
Three years after Janet's death Richard Overton was arrested and charged with first degree murder.
Richard Overton was charged with the first degree murder of his wife Janet.
Prosecutors believe that Richard Overton was jealous of the notoriety his wife achieved as president of the local school board.
Their marriage deteriorated when Richard learned that Janet was having an affair he was hurt when you're finished with the working day and you're married whether it's been a long term marriage or short term marriage there should be something to come home to and in Janet's case there wasn't anything to come home to when Richard discovered that Janet plan to divorce him he got angry and sought revenge.
Just as he had done to his previous wife Darcy when she divorced at the trial Dorothy testified against Richard about her poisoning incident.
Richard Overton also testified in his own defense he could not explain logically.
Dorothy Boyer and.
And I think that was a a damning thing to say.
And something that the certainly there's a jury could not understand my opinion.
Rancic evidence against Overton was overwhelming.
Not just the toxicology which found the cyanide and Janet system but also the forensic document examination of Overton's diaries which clearly shows overturns frame of mind at the time of Janet's death.
After she drank it she when she was going well watching with their son Eric and collapsed in the driveway he was very clever very good and almost got away with it.
Seven years after Janet's death.
Richard Overton was found guilty of first degree murder.
Sadly in nineteen ninety nine Dorothy Boyer died of lymphoma.
There is a possibility that years of selenium poisoning.
Right now science or technology can improve on a reasonable doubt we get people off in our job as well as finding the guilty and either one is satisfaction.
I will have to admit that finding murderers.
and if I were to put a number to it I would say it was probably ninety percent science and ten percent investigate.
