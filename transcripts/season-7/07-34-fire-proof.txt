In nineteen ninety two there were more than seventy five suspicious fires set in Seattle Washington during a six month period of time.
All appeared deliberately set.
It was the biggest arson case in American history solved with behavioral profiling hypnosis and the piece of art.
On the night of August ninth nineteen ninety two firefighters outside Seattle Washington faced a disaster.
Three churches were engulfed in flames at the same time just a few miles from one another.
When we arrived the fire was probably at its peak the flames were shooting above the sanctuary which was a very large sanctuary you know I would guess.
You know it must have been.
Three stories high.
The next morning.
Parishioners at Trinity Lutheran arrive to find their church in ruins.
Reverent rouse made an unusual decision.
He would conduct services anyway.
The parking lot was turned into a makeshift church.
And in the midst of smoking embers the congregation held their Sunday service as I look in the faces of many of my parishioners you could see the the sorrow.
Many were crying.
Tears of sorrow my staff.
Crying and holding each other.
They thought this can't be true.
Arson dogs were brought in to look for traces of flammable liquids non chemical tests of the rubble couldn't find excel or into either.
There was really very little trace evidence for us to recover the seeds.
There was no vandalism at the piracy.
The motive appeared to be thrill seeking.
And all of the fires started the same way on the ground floor at chestnut.
Over the next several weeks there were eight church fires six were Lutheran churches.
Eventually the arsons moved on to businesses and homes.
In one night alone they were twelve different arson fires.
All of the fires were set at night without the use of accelerates the watch people burned in the middle of the night other homes losing all their possessions standing literally the night clothes with nothing but their life left with their children sobbing we heard stories about people jumping out of windows are being lowered out of windows a lot of stories about just devastating financial impacts one victim was inside her home when the fire started I was just getting out of the tub when I start to hear strange crashing noises outside my house like glass breaking open the bathroom and it was the front door and I just the wall to the left was entirely explains this up in flames.
She grabbed a roommate and ran frantically to the front of the house the front door and then hire front porch is up in flames so our access to get out listen I'd and that was absolutely terrifying that was when Jesus make a split second decisions of my gonna live I've got to move.
The two made it out the back door and we're lucky to be alive.
From August to January.
Early on night would go by without another family getting burned out of their home.
With the fire the arsonist was getting more daring.
Is becoming very emboldened and he would actually was set afire literally looking through the window at the family dinner.
Miraculously despite extensive damage no one had been killed no one until the arsonist made his next move.
In the fall of nineteen ninety two.
Residents of Seattle and the surrounding area were under siege.
A serial arsonist had sent over twenty five buyers targeting churches businesses and homes.
All of the fires were set at night in the same way by someone igniting buildings at chest level without the use of excellence I called arsonist a guerrilla fighter because he under generally cover of night would go out proud around be unseen hit his target and be gone basically before his target becomes known anybody as fire he was very very quick he was extremely covert.
Residents formed the July into groups to protect their neighborhoods.
Local fire companies mounted all night patrols but still the fires continue the arsonist appeared to be on fire investigators he would draw to Florida from we would have one fire and and one part of town and then he would go.
Fire station be nearby he would set another fire on the other side.
So you know where the fire departments were.
But task force was formed to coordinate the investigation they commissioned a psychological profile of their suspect.
By interviewing past arsonist and identifying the traits they all have in common psychologist gain important information about the type of individual who commits these crimes.
The profile described the arsonist as white in his late teens to early twenties with an alcohol and or drug problem he was intelligent and under a chief who had probably just experienced some major trauma in his life.
He would probably be working as a salesman or delivery person since he seems familiar with many sections of the area.
Two months into the fire spree when he started fire number twenty eight.
He got careless.
Investigators found two fingerprints near the window where the blaze was sacked.
The prints were run through a computer and checked against hundreds of thousands of prints on five.
There was no match which meant it was likely the arsonist had no prior criminal record.
Two weeks later at fire number forty two he made another mistake.
Urine was found in the snow near the fire.
Forensic scientists carefully gathered the sample for DNA testing.
But since the urine was mixed with snow it was difficult to isolate any cells for analysis for is likely we were told that there were so few of us cells in there they were capable of extraction that it was not feasible.
Months went by and the fires continued the task force was no closer to identifying a suspect.
There was a concern that there were more occupied dwellings that were being targeted and I mean a large concern that we were gonna start seeing people dying.
Unfortunately just after midnight on September twenty second nineteen ninety two those fears were realized.
Fire broke out at a senior citizen home that housed more than four hundred.
Three women all residents of the home die.
Sell personally responsible for the deaths of the restaurant.
The guilt of that the misplaced guilt that was so severe that shortly afterwards I really lost all will to live.
Now police were searching not only for an arsonist but the killer.
Eventually the press coverage generated the first lead in the case.
A woman called police to say that a well dressed man bumped into her near one of the fires this individual stood out to her fashion it was his clothing the mannerisms of some odors she detected both alcohol and and and aftershave Cologne.
She said the man was intoxicated and had mentioned the fires she got a glimpse of his license plate number but they didn't write it down.
The incident happened weeks earlier.
And he had only a vague recollection of what the man looked like.
In their desperation investigators made an unusual decision they decided to try forensic hypnosis.
After sixty suspicious fires had been set in Seattle Washington investigators finally had to leave.
A woman near one of the fires had seen a suspicious looking man who had bumped into her he was intoxicated and talked about the fires but this it happened weeks before and she couldn't remember much about him.
So investigators decided to try forensic hypnosis.
Trying to find a specific unique event in her memory that can could trigger the rest the memories to flood out so it's a relaxation technique we go back in time with her to this to this point in time and have a really kind of like watch a movie for us and tell her what she sees.
This was one of the first times in U. S. history that forensic hypnosis was used in a high profile case and it was risky.
Once witnesses hypnotized most state laws prohibit an individual from testifying at the trial.
As the witness keyed in on the alcohol she smelled on the man's breath get unlocked images from the night of the fire and she began to remember what she saw.
He appeared intoxicated.
And his car a sedan possibly blue was unusually clean.
When asked if he could remember the license plate number she recalled the first letter.
She was asked if he could recall anything else she said she saw for.
That was all she could remember.
She was very receptive great candidate actually I I believe that she had a photographic memory after talking with her after the interviews she has the ability for us some some recall that most people do not have and I would say probably unique of all the the interviews I've done.
There were five hundred thousand sedan cars in north in Washington that have license plates with the letter K..
So investigators believe that the physical description of the suspect provided by their witness was the key piece of information.
To put this on paper they brought in composite hardest John Heinz.
Israeli witness I've ever done a composite drawing of who's been under hypnosis.
And that was.
Hines asked her to divide the manned space into sections and try to recall specific details of his appearance.
Composite hardest categorize the human face by teachers there are for instance nine different hi sherry.
Five different head shapes and so on.
Each featured described by the witness is marked on a fact sheet.
An FBI facial identification catalog is also used to jog the memory.
It contains thousands of pictures of facial features all visual cues for the witness.
They'Re taking a visual image verbally telling me what that images and I'm having to take that verbal description and turn it back into a visual image and thus difficult.
Using the information from the interview Hines through what the witness described.
The process is an unusual combination of interviewing skills and drawing talent.
Each teacher was put on paper with painstaking attention to every detail the witness remembered.
After two hours of meticulous work.
Perhaps this was the first.
When the drawing was finished mine showed it to the witness she said that it looked just like the neatly dressed man she'd say five months into the fires three the task force released their composite drawing to the press.
They also released to others as a control to help guard against false leads.
The psychological profile was also given to the press.
It wasn't long.
Before the hypnotic plea enhanced composite drawing paid off.
The date of that the composites appeared in the Herald I would just became physically ill.
When the composite drawings and psychological profile of the arsonist were released to the media this man George Keller believe he knew the identity of the arsonist.
He immediately went home and looked through his cell phone records and discovered that one of his business phones was used on the dates of the fires from locations near at the fires.
And his business credit card receipts showed that one of his cards was used to purchase gasoline in areas near the fires on the same day.
The person using the company credit card.
Was his son Paul.
Bore a striking resemblance to the hypnotic plea enhanced composite drawing.
I said there is a considerable resemblance between these pictures on my son Paul then I went through the profile and because I was looking for a significant.
Son ality trader something that might disqualify Paul but as I went through all the items of the profile.
It I couldn't eliminate any.
All Keller was twenty seven years old and employed in the family advertising business.
He was the oldest of three children in a deeply religious Lutheran family which possibly explains why Lutheran churches were targeted.
He was certainly emotionally rattled very upset.
But as time went on we also understood for him or from him and from his wife.
the halls presents for their family had been unsettling for most the time Paul was born.
Sponsored told police that Paul had an obsession with.
He said his son had applied for a fire fighting.
What had been rejected and that he had set a fire when he was nine years old.
Keep that other aspects of the profile he was intelligent but if done poorly in school had problems with alcohol and most striking had suffered an emotional crisis just before the arson spree began.
At that time was going through a divorce he was.
Filing for bankruptcy his life was falling apart he was drinking heavily.
And the first three numbers of this license plate exactly hypnotized witness remember.
The task force put Paul Keller under surveillance for ten days they followed him hoping they could catch him in the act.
The task force people were trying to keep him Paul under surveillance which was real challenging.
And they would lose them periodically and everybody would panic.
Eventually they decided to take him into custody.
When Keller arrived to task force headquarters his father was waiting for.
It'S all of.
Before this morning.
Love probably fifteen minutes into the interview the task force agents complimented him saying he was the best arsonist they'd ever seen.
And with that killer confessed to sending seventy five buyers including the fatal fire at the retirement home.
His method of operation was surprisingly simple.
He just walked up to the site and started the fire with a cigarette.
There is there a corrugated.
That band around at the door was wide open there I was in that state of mind and I live here and he just went that was the only one that I really ever.
State to watch.
It went real fast very fast it also went to multiple aren't very bad very bad.
Keller also said he was sexually molested by a volunteer fireman when he was twelve years old.
Paul Keller was convicted of arson and murder and was sentenced to ninety nine years in prison.
He won't be eligible for parole until the S. one hundred thirteen years old.
To get a word to the victims all I like.
We will be sorry for your pain and your lots.
We shall never forget.
Was the biggest in U. S. history.
It'S very hard to rationally explain why I did that because there's no rational reason I was not angry at three AM ET I was not but I was very empty and perhaps I thought that others needed to be as empty as I was.
But it was not a valid thing to do.
And investigators say he may not have been caught if not for the forensic hypnosis and the composite drawing.
