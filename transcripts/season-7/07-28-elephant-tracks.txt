From the evidence found at the scene of a double homicide police suspected there might have been two perpetrators until they noticed a clue.
A small shard of glass on the bottom of one of the victims shoes which brought the whole crime into focus.
In December nineteen ninety six a mail carrier in Toledo Ohio noticed mail piling up outside the home of Gertrude Thompson and Edward Kowalczyk.
Neighbors said they hadn't seen the elderly couple for the last few days.
Sixty nine year old girl Trudy Trudy to our friends and seventy two year old Edward had been living together for the past several years.
No one could see inside the house since the windows were covered with plastic cardboard and aluminum foil in an effort to preserve heat.
Not knowing what else to do neighbors called police.
When I first went in I observed a lot of what appeared to be personal effects of the residents there like boxes.
Got it appeared to me someone might have been prepared to move out of the house.
But in the disarray detectives found Trudy Thompson and ed Kowalczyk dead on the living room floor.
They had been dead for several days.
And it was no ordinary merger.
One was crying scenes ever seen as a police officer.
An autopsy revealed the truth the embed had died of blunt force injuries to the head.
Other evidence suggested that the assailant had wanted information from the victims.
Just slight wounds puncture wounds where this person probably was saying where's the money where's the money something like that and just torture to make a person talk.
There was a great deal of chaos there in fact it appeared as though this was almost a frenzy type of murder they the perpetrator or perpetrators grab anything that was available to them in the house and used it as an instrument.
We always assume there was at least two people that were involved.
And that's just because it was a double homicide with two bodies right next to each other and they were killed with firearms they were killed slowly with.
Detectives noticed that there had been no forced entry into the house.
Where it tells me that possibly the person that committed this crime.
Probably knew the victims and probably was a leading in.
It in truth he not only live together they were business partners.
They own several properties that they rented to lower income residents and college students.
When a tenant moved out the couple usually kept items left behind never throwing them away.
This made it hard to know what if anything was missing.
We were finding money hidden in books and in wallets that were still in their package and in places where they would hide things that no one would think to look.
Family members told police that a necklace Trudy Thompson wore around her neck every day was missing.
It was a gold elephant pendant a gift her father had given her years earlier as a child in Austria.
The pendant was supposed to bring good luck.
So police put a photograph of the pendant on the front page of the local newspaper the Toledo blade.
No one responded and none of the secondhand jewelry dealers in town had seen it either.
In gathering information about the couple ed's daughter Denise Kowalczyk said the Trudy was a tough business woman I felt the treaty could be bossy and domineering I think she was probably argumentative with her tenants and.
Family members suspected that the motive wasn't robbery but it was some sort of business disagreement.
tenant that was really really mad at them mostly her.
It'S not totally unreal that this would happen because of the people they rented to.
That information along with the message on the couple's telephone answering machine would identify just that one of the couple's tenants someone police called the perfect suspect.
When landlords Trudy Thompson and ed Kowalczyk were found murdered in their homes.
Police and forensic scientists sorted through the physical evidence at the crime scene for possible clues.
Rancic Bathala just doctor Diane Barnett first wanted to identify the murder weapon she had long linear impressions tool marks on the skull she had a very characteristic beating pattern that had been left on the outer table of the cal Merriam.
And she also had suggestions of a corner of something like a different type of impression.
Dr Bernard was able to match those wounds to a rectangular base land at the murder scene.
Forensic anthropologist Julie Saul matched another head wound to a brass lamp found near the bodies.
Looking at the lamp base with the beating near the edge and the toe marks on the bone I could tell them that this was consistent with having made that market was very likely that it could have made that mark.
None of these items however contained fingerprints the coroner determined Trudy and ed had fought off their attacker or attackers since they had defensive wounds on their hands that could have been made by a knife.
And the tiny clue on the bottom of that goal six shoes answered an important question.
It was a tiny piece of glass in bed in the bottom of his galoshes.
That glass came from a broken light bulb leading investigators to believe that had entered the room some time after the attacks started.
Most likely he walked in from outside since the scope was found the front door.
In a search for suspects the first clue came from the couple's telephone answering machine.
Calling and leaving the messages but only one tenant had called numerous times his name was Ethan walls.
When questioned walls told police that he stop by and introduce home to make his rent payment noticed the overflowing mailboxes knocked on the door and when there was no answer he said he left his rent check there and went home.
I put it in the mailbox there was a lot of mail in the box I didn't think anything of it.
Two three more days went by I left a note for them to contact me.
No one ever got in touch with me.
All standard reddit he went back to it introduced house retrieved his rent money and spent it.
These two admissions placed walls at the scene twice around the time the murders took place and also needs installing this very bizarre story about dropping off a check then coming back and picking it up.
In addition an informant called police to say she had seen Ethan walls at the home of the well known drug dealer around the time of the murders she also said well sure was spattered with blood.
Based on the blood spatter on the ceilings on the walls.
The condition the victims bodies you knew the guy that did this.
Walls vehemently denied the informant's story.
This is a lie from.
Where did it come from who put you up to say and what you say.
Which is not true totally.
In examining the blood spatter at the crime scene.
Diffs noticed a significant.
The blood spatter was into different shapes and told two different stories.
In one area the spot swirl long dated and radiated from where the beatings took place.
One that comes from an angle is longer and more oval usually with a little tail at the end of it the longer and more oval the the spanner is the greater the angle that it came from.
In another area away from the bodies there were several blood spots that were perfect circles including two on the inside of a broken ceramic vase and one on a piece of paper in the desk drawer.
The blood that was on these items was dripped straight down as if from right above so from that we were able to determine that this blood most likely did not come from these two victims and was there for most likely the suspects what.
The blonde was consistent with someone standing still bleeding and the blood dripping down on the items below.
Police confiscated every nice they could find any thin walls home testing them for human blood to see if any were used in the murders.
None of them tested positive for human life.
They also compared all of Wall shoes to a bloody foot impressions found at the crime scene.
But since the perpetrator left blood at the crime scene investigators had a definitive way to tell if the blood belonged to walls.
One drop of blood looks the same your blood looks just identical to mine.
Who can differentiate between one drop in another.
The results surprised everyone especially Ethan walls they arrested me.
Like five months after.
Toledo police have a suspect in the murder of two elderly landlords one of their tenants he done walls who swore he was innocent.
Walls had been to the couple's house around the time of the murders.
And an informant claimed she souls at a drug party with blood on his shirt around the same time.
Walls gave police a blood sample so they could compare it to blood found at the murder scene.
Investigators believe the killer cut himself while swinging a crystal lamp to be the victim.
We surmise that that was probably how he held the land as he hit them with the heavy metal base of the lamp and when that crystal broke in his hand that's probably how he cut himself.
The rent six scientists analyzed the DNA of all the blood at the murder scene.
On the crystal land there was a mixture of blood from three people the two victims and the killers.
If it matched to numbered markers or fans would match those found in the mixture Ethan walls pattern was an eighteen and a twenty eight the mixture.
Also had an eighteen but it did not have a twenty eight so he can automatically be excluded as contributing to the mixture that specimen.
But prosecutors always suspected that there may have been more than one perpetrator and based on the informant's testimony that Walsh was one of the two.
Walls was arrested and charged with the murder of Trudy Thompson and ed Kowalczyk.
The day I was arrested last thing I said it.
Please don't stop looking.
I was the very last thing I said as they put in cuffs so me don't stop look.
Eastern walls knew he could face the death penalty if convicted he was consumed with anger and frustration.
And you holler at the top of your voice.
Okay nobody here.
As prosecutors were preparing to try Ethan walls.
Their star witness the informant made a startling confession the prosecutor Tim Braun.
She now said she had lied about Ethan walls.
We never given a good explanation as to what our research work.
Other than she sang I lied about the man and this is right and I'm not going to testify against him we can't necessarily control the pressures that come on to witness and she flipped that's the only way to describe it she flipped completely one hundred eighty degrees the other way.
Ron had no choice but to dismiss the charges against the thin walls.
You know the date he dismissed a death penalty case when your prosecutor it's a.
Because everything you've been working on for a long period of time it's just blown up in your face.
I was confident.
That I will go home.
Wavered in mom I knew I was going on.
For the victims families it re opened the fear that there was maybe someone out there that might be.
Really second evil that they could do something to someone else.
And for police it was back to square one it was very frustrating because we had two elderly people murdered brutally in our community.
We felt we had some good evidence but and the missing pendant if we could now let down we definitely would have a person that we could totally concentrate on.
For the next two years police made no further progress.
All the talk to talk about the seventy two hour rule cases insolvent three days.
The chances of getting south go way way down that's true and this was not solved within three days.
But they kept going.
For two years after the merger is of Trudy Thompson and ed Kowalczyk investigators pursued various leads in the case with no success.
But in July of nineteen ninety eight their luck changed.
The daughter of pawn shop owner Annette shivering a decided to help her mother clean up some of the old newspapers and magazines that had collected over the years my mother's more than eccentric she she believes and not.
Not throwing anything away type of a nanotube she's a collector.
What Annette wanted something to read that afternoon the past the time.
To reach is in the middle of a stack of newspapers in polls and news paper out.
Sure enough she opens it up and she starts to rediscover article that was there for the to the police department.
About a double homicide.
It was the two year old newspaper article about the merger of Trudy Thompson and ed Kowalczyk.
When she looked at the victim's photographs she noticed something familiar the gold elephant pendant around Trudy Thompson's neck she calls me on the phone starts ringing.
Missy shivering he had been unable to sell the pendant it looks identical to the one true Thompson was wearing in the newspaper photograph.
One in a million I would say.
One for the pendant was dated December third nineteen ninety six around the time of the couple's murder and it identified Gordy candidate has the seller.
Candy said he was only a messenger that it was James Jordan who had asked him to pull on the necklace for him.
Jordan had been working as a handyman for Trudy Thompson at the time of her murder.
A background check indicated that Jordan was arrested just a few weeks after the murders for another robbery and was currently serving a forty five year prison sentence in Texas.
When questioned Jordan denied he killed the elderly couple scientists swabbed the inside of his cheek for a sample of his DNA which was then compared to the blood drops at the crime scene we concluded that James Jordan.
Was the person that left blood at the crime scene.
James Jordan was charged with killing Gertrude Thompson and Edward Kowalczyk.
Prosecutors believe the motive was robbery to steal money from the rent payments to use for drugs.
They think Jordan first tortured and killed from day.
Cutting his hand with a broken lamp and leaving blood drops in the living room.
When they had walked in later from outside Jordan killed him to.
As he was looking for money blood from his hand dripped into the desk drawer.
Before leaving Jordan took Trudy's elephant pendant then asked a friend pointed for.
The pendant fetched all of twenty dollars.
And but for that reckless act we never would've looked back.
In court Jordan represented himself and tried to explain why his blood was found in Trudy's desk.
Explained the drops of blood inside her desk is being that's where she used the keeper bandaids so some time when he was mayor of moving furniture or doing something in most.
But Jordan couldn't explain his blood drops inside the broken days and he said he had Trudy's elephant pendant because she gave it to him as payment for his handyman services but the jury did not believe his story.
James Jordan was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death.
The case was solved thanks to the pawn shop owner who never threw anything away.
And the forensic scientists ability to recreate the crime based on the physical evidence.
The police work combined with luck and scientific evidence a little bit above a little bit of everything L. close together.
