He allowed his victim to write a last will and testament to her family then.
In them with chilling phone calls.
But scientists would find.
Seventeen year old sherry Smith had her whole life before her.
In two days she would have the honor of singing the national anthem at her graduation from the Lexington high school then she would sail off on a cruise with her classmates she was kind of the cement that held our family together she was always a happy one three thirty eight PM on may thirty first nineteen eighty five Sherri arrived home from a graduation party she stopped at the mailbox some seven hundred feet from our house.
Your father was watching from his home office as she pulled in five or ten minutes of past and all of a sudden I was aware that she had not come to the house yet so something just told me that something was wrong and I ran through the house and into the garage and got in my car and cranked it up and drove to the mailbox.
Bob Smith found the door of his daughter's automobile open the motor running and Cherise purse on the seat.
I don't have to tell you this.
The shares Kerr is at the end of the driveway running and she's not in it.
And I can remember now I said oh my god not my share.
Panic stricken the couple called the Lexington county sheriff's office.
Near the mailbox on the ground of some mail which indicated to us that she had gotten out of the car to pick up the mail and was probably adopted at that point Brian spot playing out of the ordinary Lexington county sheriff Jim Mattson the gently organized the largest manhunt in South Carolina history.
We really didn't know whether sharing knew her a doctor I'm not we certainly had no reason to expect that she had run a why are that she left on our own whoever is it has a daughter sherry.
We will go back.
And please send it back home where she belongs.
Her parents could do was wait.
The Smith family was a very influential family in the community and there was no reason that we could determine why she would be kidnapped other than maybe for ransom purposes so we anticipated that the individual individuals response would make contact with the family.
The sheriff's suspicions proved right two days after sherry had been abducted the Smith's received a phone call.
A man with a strangely distorted voice demanded to speak to Mrs Smith.
Route the call was not a hoax he described the black and yellow bathing suit cherry was wearing beneath her shorts and shirt.
He said he would release her.
He said that she was fine they were watching TV she was eating a little bit and but he was given lots of water.
And she was.
He made no ransom demand but he told the smiths the day would be receiving a letter in the morning.
My reaction was an individual who's got some sophistication of the crimes committing this is not the first time that he has engaged in a sex crime of some sort probably has been thinking about committing a crime like this for quite some time.
Agent Walker agreed that the best hope of finding Shari could come from the latter part of doctor promised was coming.
We walk up the postmaster in Lexington on the weekend went over to the post office and started looking through the mail and everybody put on plastic gloves and we all sorted through the mail to we found the letter addressed to the smiths.
Inside was a letter in Shari's handwriting.
At the top of the first page was the heading last will and testament.
Sherri Smith said Dr had allowed the teenager to write a two page letter to her family.
In which she told him how much she loved them.
I had a very helpless feeling come over me but I was not without hope hello my hope to the end but I was totally helpless the word last will and testament just not me back and I was totally helpless I did not know what to do or what to say and then I had the tough part was I had to show the letter to my wife please don't ever let this ruin your lives Shari's letter Randy just keep on living one day at a time for Jesus some good will come out of this my thoughts will always be with and in you.
In parentheses with the words casket closed.
Sheriff Mack's immediately sent a letter to the South Carolina law enforcement crime lab hoping forensic document examiner Mickey Dawson could find some clues I was looking for him pointing a hand writing I was looking to see if I could afford find any trace evidence to send the hairs and fibers after the letter arrived.
The doctor called the Smith family again.
Well I'm not really sure I believe you because I haven't had any.
I don't know.
Later that same evening he called once more saying that sherry was alive and implied he would release her soon.
A mentally emotionally.
The call was traced to a public pay phone at a drug store in downtown Lexington but in nineteen eighty five trap and trace required fifteen minutes for authorities to trace the call and reach its location.
The a Dr remained on the phone for a very short time.
Five days after Shahreza production the kidnapper called again and spoke to both sherry's mother and her twenty one year old sister dawn.
Fifty eight AM.
The next day he made another call.
One quarter mile.
A white male welcome back they are.
Not a big the police officers I said let me go with you let me go I want to go with you to find sherry.
But investigators insisted on going along.
Sherry'S body was found in the backyard.
And white shorts she'd last been seen the autopsy revealed sherry had been dead for several days.
Investigators believe the charities of doctor inadvertently revealed when he killed her when he corrected himself about the time she wrote the letter.
They believe sherry died at four fifty eight on the morning of June first two hours after she wrote the letter.
If that were the case Sherri remained alive for only twelve hours after her abduction.
One line I'll never forget she says casket close.
Can you imagine.
What was going through her mind knowing what she was gonna face she knew at that point her body would be in a condition that the casket had to be closed.
Agent Walker believes the killer tried to buy time while the body was outside diminishing the chances to recover crucial forensic evidence.
A medical examiner found residue your duct tape on her face suggesting that the cause of death was suffocation.
It was substantially shorter he had to cut the duct tape out of her hair to keep from leaving it behind and that told me that he had some experience at least or some level of criminal sophistication.
Based on knowledge gained from past defenders of similar crimes the FBI had this hypothesis the profile that we developed of him described as a white male prior married.
Unsuccessfully merry probably not currently married mid to late twenties to maybe even as old as early thirties who who had a history of sex crimes.
The signal analysis unit of the FBI engineering section told investigators that the voice distortion of the doctor's voice was accomplished by something called a variable speed control device.
We believe either through employment or through his technical education had some sort of background experience electronics.
Investigators believe the killer had everything planned out and was reading from a script clearly evident twenty corrected himself about the time of Shari's letter.
As a final assault to the family.
The killer called them on the night of Shari's funeral.
It was a collect call.
I wanted to tell us just how he had murdered sherry and he said well can you take it.
But we didn't have a choice we had to try to keep them on the line to find out where you want a few weeks later the killer cold again.
This time he no longer wanted to talk about.
After the funeral of seventeen year old Shari Smith's.
Killer continued to taunt the family by phone but he no longer had any interest in charity.
Two weeks after Shari Smith was kidnapped.
The father was inside just twenty feet away a neighbor saw someone pull up in a car get out and grabbed Deborah before speeding off.
Deborah was a pretty blue eyed blonde.
Deborah was only a child.
Yeah we are.
I felt like we were dealing with the the same individual.
Investigators now knew they were hunting a serial killer.
Based on past criminal research authorities believed that the killer would be displaying more compulsive behavior losing weight drinking heavily not shaving regularly and would be eager to talk about the merger.
The South Carolina law enforcement division scientists were still going over there only piece of hard evidence Shari's last will and testament.
It had been written on lined paper from a legal pad.
Forensic document examiner Nicky Dawson believed latent images or indentations from the previous page of the pad might be revealed with the use of an electrostatic detection apparatus.
When I receive the letter took it into a laboratory open it up on our store paper and with gloves to three pages apart with each page to the initial examination intake and then the H. shaped with conventional to go into a humidifier box.
Increasing the humidity of the paper would yield a better result from the conductivity of electrical charges.
The document was then placed on top of a brass plate and the magnetic field activated.
The paper was then brushed with a substance similar to fingerprint powder.
Through the combination of all of this laden images form Dawson's first try yielded what appeared to be a grocery list Elson bills to pay and there was a list of our names and telephone numbers left someone to call in case of an emergency Dawson was able to make out what appeared to be.
The first set of numbers two oh five was the area code for Alabama the next three eight three seven was the exchange for Hans.
But the only had three of the last four numbers to finish the sequence.
They just plugged the nine digits and for the summer and from a telephone number that was a good number finally call this guy in Alabama do you have any relatives in South Carolina he should yes of my mother and father the man's father was fifty year old Ellie shepherd who lived just fifteen miles away from Shari Smith's home.
Telephone records indicated that some of the calls to the Smith family after sherry subduction were made from shepherd's home.
Not surprisingly police wanted to hear what Mr shepherd had to say.
Fifty year old Emma Sheppard was an electrician and telephone records show that some of the calls to the Smith home after her abduction were made from his phone.
I wasn't worried but you know it was a little bit of a shock of it wanted to talk to me.
Shepherd had no idea why his son's telephone number was found on Shari Smith's last will and testament shepherd said he and his wife were on vacation at the time of sherry Smith subduction an alibi which checked out.
Police played a recording of the killer's voice.
Larry gene bell.
He worked for Ellis doing electrical wiring bell was house sitting for the shepherds during the six weeks they had been away on vacation.
I'D left the bail a lot of phone numbers that he may need to call in my absence forward on our trip.
Those pages were turned over to investigators but transparency of the shepherd's original note was super imposed over Shari's last will and testament.
Matched the indentations on Shari's letter proving that Shari used a piece of paper directly underneath.
The shepherds also said the green belt picked them up at the airport all he wanted to talk about was the kidnapping and murder of the Smith girls.
Bell had lost weight was on shaven and seems highly agitated.
This is the police video taken inside the shepherds.
Investigators found six blond hairs in the bathroom that were microscopically similar to sherry's hair.
The commemorative Dr Stan used to mail her last will and testament matched a sheet of stamps in LA shepherds desk drawer.
Bell was arrested the following morning.
They just seem to be shocked that law enforcement now had centered in on him.
As the FBI had predicted bell had been involved in various sexual incidents since childhood he had been in trouble for making obscene telephone calls and at one point even attempting to kidnap a young co ed from the university of South Carolina.
When questioned bell denied any involvement in the murders of sherry Smith and Deborah Helmick the only thing he wanted to say over and over was that this Larry gene bell didn't do it is not bad Larry James Brown.
Larry gene bell stood trial for the murder of sherry Smith in January nineteen eighty six.
Sheriff Smith had the fortitude and the courage to arrive at her last will and testament.
And I put the pen that we took from the shepherd house in front of the jury said that each one of you.
The jury needed only forty seven minutes to return the verdict of guilty of kidnapping and first degree murder.
Larry gene bell was sentenced to death by electrocution that was the only punishment for him.
And probably this is horrible to say.
Too good of a punishment for them.
He was tried separately for the kidnapping and murder of Deborah Helmick.
The jury returned the same verdict.
Ten years after his trial Larry gene bell became the last man to die in south Carolina's electric chair.
And without the ability to bring up things on that page that you couldn't see with the naked eye.
It would have been even longer before we had gotten Larry gene bell that piece of paper that indented writing is what made the case and was sealed his fate.
He ultimately signed his death warrant.
Bob Smith remains a chaplain for the sheriff's department.
His wife Hilda recently authored the book the rose of Sharon to honor their daughter's memory.
Both are convinced hi sherry predicted in her last will and testament some good has come out of their monumental loss.
That letter has a has been more closer to me than any kind of closure that the course could do for me just the fact that she knew what she was going and she had that kind of fight.
