Police in Phoenix Arizona were asked to solve the mystery of the limb found in a dumpster.
From just a small body part archaeologist toxicologist and DNA scientists piece together enough information about the victim the lead police to the killer.
On June eighth nineteen ninety two a man looking through a garbage dumpster made a frightening discount.
dumpster diver found a large plastic bag which he I'll wrap not knowing what was in it and discovered the severed leg there was also a song.
Phoenix homicide detectives Rico for Gozo and Joseph Petrosino were first on the scene.
I think the longer I stay here.
I say it's very scary because since I moved here there's been a lot of.
The waste management driver Jesse Pena told police he emptied the dumpster just one hour earlier.
I immediately thought this guy meaning the victim has been scattered probably two of the dumpsters in the area and now we need to go out and try to look at the rest the body in the other dumpsters.
Detectives searched every dumpster within a five mile radius they were hoping to find more of the body to compare to dental records fingerprints are missing persons reports.
They found nothing.
Although there wasn't much to autopsy the medical examiner could tell it was a leg of the male Caucasian between thirty and forty years old.
The presence of scars on the knee are helpful him that this person's had either trauma or surgery in this case surgical types Garces had surgical intervention on the knee.
Initially investigators thought the scars would help identify the victim until they learned how common knee surgery had become.
The muscles from the side of the lake was analyzed and in the screening for the common drugs of abuse we found a significant levels of methamphetamine or speed and a trace quality service primary metabolites amphetamine.
A possible indication the incident was drug related and Dr Keane could tell that the victim was dead before the leg was removed.
The relative absence of blood in the legs indicative that the leg had been severed after death when there was no ongoing active circulation in the body.
This call was not China natural disease and did not have the the features of an accident such as industrial action.
The precise mechanism of death was not apparent with the examination of jostling so we classified the death as homicidal violence manner of death homicide.
An anthropologist measured the femur the largest bone in the body.
There were no missing persons reports of a thirty to forty year old white male six feet tall possibly involved with methamphetamine.
Methamphetamine is an illegal street drug a stimulant commonly known as speed or crank.
By the mid nineteen nineties authorities say that the Mexican drug lords were funneling huge amounts of methamphetamine into Arizona.
Methamphetamines overtook cocaine as the number one drug of addiction reported by Arizona drug treatment centers.
With the rise in the use of methamphetamine there was also a rise in the number of people involved in manufacturing and distribution.
Several days after the discovery of the land investigators got a telephone call about a missing methamphetamine.
Police hoped it was the break they were looking for.
Police in Phoenix Arizona at a seemingly impossible task to find the killer loose in there said when they're only evidence was a severed leg.
Rancic tests revealed the individual was a male Caucasian six feet tall between thirty and forty years old.
Not long after these forensic tests were completed a woman called police headquarters asking how to fill out a missing persons report she said her boyfriend had returned home missing missing.
Now how do I go about filling out a missing persons report we had a pair of sneakers on and a pair of shorts she said it wasn't uncommon friendly town go to Las Vegas be there for a couple of days and that but he'd always return it always answered pages and phone messages and that wasn't happening in this case.
The woman said her boyfriend was Norman close and at first glance match the profile.
Klaas was thirty two years old stood six feet tall had undergone knee surgery and was a methamphetamine dealer.
He was a real friendly outgoing social person.
Get plenty of friends in the valley no one ever said anything derogatory about norm that I know of a recall.
Although Norman Klaas was well liked the undoubtedly had his share of enemies.
Take your time.
Tell us what you think will be asking you some questions plus his girlfriend Patricia identified the surgical scar and the tennis shoe and sock as the type Norman usually wore.
But investigators wanted to be certain of the identification so they suggested D. N. A. testing at the lake was thought to have come from Norman Klaas you know let's get his parents and let's do a reverse paternity.
Since half of our DNA comes from our mother and half from our father it would have been simple to determine if the limb was Norman's by comparing his DNA to his parents DNA.
But when detectives learned class was adopted they knew that would be impossible.
Scientists hope to find some other way to make an identification.
In researching classes background police discovered that he had donated one of his kidneys to his younger sister.
On a long shot police contacted the hospital in Houston Texas where the transplant had taken place.
Sell samples are routinely taken from prospective donors to make sure the recipient won't reject their organs.
Fortunately for investigators the hospital in Houston had a policy of keeping it cell samples for one hundred years.
DNA testing would be possible after all.
This auto radiograph shows the DNA from the leg muscle compared to the cells taken from Norman close.
The interpretation of otter answer very simple you're doing simple pattern comparison you're looking at DNA banding patterns asking the question are the DNA banding patterns the same are they in the same orientation in the same location on the yacht around very simple very easy to interpret the lake or the muscle tissue from the lakes regional class.
I'Ve never had a DNA case before part of this we had matched up in one like that.
I was very static when I found this out and then notified his family back in in Texas.
Now the police had positively identified the victim their focus turned to identifying the killer.
I was concerned there was someone out there that had either lost it and was going to cause a lot of more a grievance the feast which part.
Police began questioning Norman's friends to determine his whereabouts on his last day alive.
Norman'S girlfriend Patricia was the most helpful.
We learned from her that Norman had kind of a colorful past as a methamphetamine cooker one of the people that you probably seen last was his business partner who was also a methamphetamine cooker by the name of grand king.
And the two of them have been friends for a long time but had recently had a falling out and had become rivals in the drug business.
Detectives found Norman classes car just a block away from king's home.
With a search warrant detectives wanted to find a safe way to search king's home.
Cameras were mounted outside giving king three hundred sixty degree look around the entire circumference.
Gun ports provided a clear shot every inch of the property.
The doors and windows were reinforced.
Anything less than a bulldozer was I'm going to get you in in a timely fashion and certainly.
As a drug manufacture that would give him time to dispose of a lot of the evidence.
Police waited until king walked outside to his car before serving a search warrant.
Once inside the house investigators uncovered and possible.
He was into weapons all sorts of weapons firearms and crossbows and throwing knives and knives and everything is hidden inside of the residence and Nixon crannies that he specially made for these weapons in his bed in the walls behind doors he had every known.
Weapon you can think of from.
What was made forty years ago to the present time.
Detectives also found marijuana and methamphetamine.
It probably tasted as product away more often than he should.
Might have affected his.
And in the laundry room investigators noticed that someone presumably king had recently painted the walls and floor.
Tell us fresh paint the smell is still there Hey you can also detect an order of the pine sol or Clorox very strong presence in the water.
But could investigators find out the laundry room had been the scene of violence or did they get there too late.
The new paint had covered potential evidence.
In the laundry room of gray in king's hall the walls and floor had recently been painted and the room disinfected.
Either king was a meticulous housekeeper or he had gone to a great deal of trouble to hide something.
Determined to find which one it was investigators removed the laundry table that was built into the wall.
Behind the tables with some tiny spots.
We took samples of that and then we cut out the entire wall.
The spots were evaluated with the castle Meyer test which reacts with the iron component in blood.
That test was positive despite the flushing and washing attempts they were still able to find the traces of human blood and identify the the scene as being a scene of considerable blood letting.
The next step was to determine who's blind.
The DNA from the tiny specks on the wall was compared to the DNA from the muscles in the amputated leg.
Reinforced my I believe in the power of RFLP technology and DNA technology at at at the time.
Graham king refused to answer questions.
But police soon got an unexpected break telephone call from one of king's friends who had suspected king was involved in foul play.
The caller was Troy Killa.
Who said he was working and Graham kings backyard with Norman class went inside but never came out.
Yeah I know although he wasn't an eyewitness he was the next best thing and here with us.
This is this audiotape statement to police.
For only one more room and more I heard the gunshot before the Iron Curtain the man up within that I don't know for a fact because I grew a lot of it but I can reconcile with the crowns and things that I heard.
Really killer told police he waited for an hour then knocked on the door to collect his tools.
Our our our walk out.
You look also said the king and costs were involved in a dispute but it wasn't about drugs it was about a woman.
Graham king's girlfriend.
Have been involved with Norma claws and she might have become pregnant because enormous claws Graham king found out and that's what because we think we're motivated that the murder.
Graham king was arrested and charged with first degree murder.
Despite the results of a DNA test and the medical examiner's opinion that Norman Klaas was dead before his leg was removed.
Norman'S girlfriend Patricia refuses to believe Norman is day which was evident when we asked her for an interview.
Tricia believes Norman staked his own death to avoid a drug related confrontation.
As prosecutors prepared for the trial they had another child.
Persuading their primary witness to testify.
Prosecutors believe the Norman Klaas went the grand kings home I know where the king was angry with him for his involvement with his girlfriend.
He placed the body of the garbage bags.
Some time later that night he dumped the bags in various dumpsters throughout the city.
Although king painted and disinfected the laundry room the tiny specks of blood on the wall behind the laundry table proved to be his undoing.
Four square feet to a wall.
That was able to deliver up enough evidence to positively say this is where this happened at.
We were we're incredibly lucky we we did a lot of good police work but we have some real lucky things happen.
That you can't count on in this job.
King plays one of the limbs in a dumpster that was completely empty.
Unfortunately for him the dumpster and been emptied out I believe in our prior to him dumping that one leg and.
Otherwise we have never found Norman clause he would still be a missing person.
None of Norman classes other body parts were ever found.
This case required a wide variety of forensic techniques.
Anthropology determined the victims hi tops a college he found the meth amphetamine DNA tests matched tissue cells from the victim which had been in storage for ten years.
Finally the castle Meyer test identified what the killer never saw.
Which DNA testing confirmed was classes it goes from are you ever going to prove this case just with a leg to its proved with medical and testimonial certainty.
In the not too distant future DNA tests on a single drop of blood we'll be able to identify such things as the victim's gender their hair and eye color height weight and ethnicity.
Before the trial prosecutor suffered a setback when their witness Troy Kellogg refused to testify saying he feared for his life.
No way no how.
So prosecutors reached a plea agreement with Graham king.
King agreed to plead guilty to second degree murder which carries a sentence of twenty years in a maximum security prison instead of going to trial and risking the death penalty.
I got a bargain get the deal of a lifetime.
Twenty years he's not gonna be that old when he gets out.
Certainly not for a.
Not for somebody that cooks methamphetamine and kills people.
I'M very concerned with with Mr Graham king being released.
And I think he will be a menace to society I think will happen again so this is one of the cases that I that I do remember and and whenever I give tours or give DNA talks.
I took two college classes and such this is the one story that I will always bring up the DNA was very critical for this investigation without it we have never have solved it.
But even now ten years later Norman classes girlfriend still does not accept the forensic results she continues to believe that Norman faked his own death and that one day he will return.
Thank you for calling bye bye.
