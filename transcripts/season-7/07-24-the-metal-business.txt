Just after opening a vintage car restoration business bill rouse became seriously ill.
Doctors had difficulty finding the cause.
But to forensic scientists it looked like foul play.
From the day he found an abandoned model a Ford in an old warehouse fill rows Snoop that vintage automobiles would be his life.
For most of his career Phil was a salesman in nineteen ninety seven he quipped to finally pursue his dream of starting an antique car restoration business.
He called it top quality and it was housed in the garage near his home in Bartlett Tennessee it was really excited about going into business he added that was his dream.
To no one's surprise the shop was successful from the day it opened.
And with that success came the need to expand.
For capital filled turned to his best friend and next door neighbor Steve white who was anxious to invest in the business in exchange for part ownership.
Bill'S good friend chemo Coello also joined the company as a matter of fact everybody was happy with the with the way things are going my was happy we got off to a good start.
It was Phil's knowledge talent and experience that made the company so successful.
What does that with fifteen years old I guess I put my first and I think I was sixteen when Phil rouse became ill just two months after the shop opened it was a serious blow.
I got to where I didn't have any energy and my stomach give me a lot of trouble I had trouble with digestion I had severe chest pains my hands and feet began to get numb.
And to make matters worse medical tests couldn't find the calls I had an older sound on a cat scan and an older ultrasound and all those tests came up negative.
Inexplicably bills conditions continue to get worse he lost thirty pounds and had difficulty walking and his cognitive abilities were also affected.
He came home and he says Joe I think I've got Alzheimer's I'm getting Alzheimer's.
I said one failed he said after I got my way to the shop.
To protect his investment while filled with sales Steve white ran the day to day operations of the business.
By December Phil was convinced he was going to die.
I was so sick that night I was in such bad pain that I actually took my shirt off and laid on the kitchen floor on the loan him I thought maybe that cold floor would take the pain and burning out of my stomach.
Restoring automobile sometimes involves chemicals and solvents that can cause illness if the workplace isn't properly ventilated.
Still wondered whether this had been his problem.
But his doctors were doubtful since no one else in the shop became ill.
Then fill became convinced that someone was trying to kill.
So he went to police headquarters with an unusual request he said if he died he wanted the police to perform an autopsy because he thought someone was poisoning him.
The police were skeptical.
But I noticed that the other detectives were walking around in fact what was kind of doing this.
And I got upset I got I got I got very aggravated with that.
Phil'S family thought he was exaggerating I wanted proof at that something was being done to him.
And I we said you should have waited.
Nothing in the world going to convince me that I was wrong that night a lot and never gone to the police station if you didn't think it took some college going to police station you're wrong.
He was afraid that nothing would be able to save his life.
Just months after opening his vintage car restoration business.
Bill rouse was so sick he could no longer run the business on a day to day basis.
His best friend next door neighbor and business partner Steve white was now running the business my business partner told me not to worry about it is that if you're sick you stay home stay only get well.
While sitting home Phil rose heard rumors that his company wasn't paying its bills we were taking money and the money was never the triggered back to our suppliers to pay their bills.
Rouse went to the bank and discover the tan company checks written by his partner had bounced because of insufficient funds.
And he also learned why the company had no money and when I got copies of checks I can be honest with you I I was not happy with what I saw.
He was paying for his personal cell phone bill seventy eighty dollars a month he was paying for his own military insurance it was.
Making checks to this local wine and spirits company somewhere closer store buying booze and Phil noticed that Steve white had written a check to a company called American national for one hundred and twenty seven dollars when he didn't recognize the company Ross decided to call.
She said it's life insurance.
S. is can you tell me more about it she said well it's for a hundred thousand miles.
And the beneficiary and owner of the policy is Steve Allen white.
But the life insurance policy wasn't on Steve white's life.
It was on Phil rouses.
And there was no reciprocal policy on Steve white's life naming rouse as the beneficiary.
Leona white says her husband did nothing wrong that they were only trying to protect their investment in the event of Phil's death.
Steve Watson into although restoring his involvement in the business had been more from I. business management standpoint but we kept trying to have a business meeting so we could see the check book which we have never seen and.
Every time we go to have a meeting state would get up and get angry and storm out of the house so we were getting a little bit suspicious.
The final straw came when Steve white clothes the company's bank accounts without telling Phil who found out through the bank teller.
She'S the oldest why came in two days ago walked at the bank with the two thousand nine hundred forty three dollars and close the account and she said the reason I mention the humor Strauss is because there were checks outstanding and he said he didn't care he just wanted the money.
Rouse believe that AS fifty percent owner of the business he had the power to halt all such transactions but he was wrong.
When Phil's lawyer reviewed the partnership agreement he discovered the field only owned two percent of the business Steve white owned the remaining ninety eight percent.
Well I signed a lot of things in nineteen ninety seven if Steve came over said you need to sign this because this is for that whatever we sign it.
He was completely duped into signing this contract.
They'Ll now began to suspect his partner.
And decided to visit Dr Kevin Moore Ricky and one of the top forensic toxicologists in the United States.
He was one of the worst cases that I'd seen.
Tell me is very very sick.
And I said well I think I'm being murdered I don't know how.
I don't know how what's being used on me.
Dr meridian analyzed fills urine tests which have been done earlier and he also performed a physical examination.
Before the results were in still had more bad news.
All of the business assets he brought with him to the company which included the building and real estate had been transferred to his partner Steve white and put up for sale.
Bill rouse began to suspect that the improprieties in his business and his suspicions of being poisoned might somehow be related.
Mr rouse wasn't very functional if you would say cognitively he had a lot of the.
He had an ability to concentrate focus is very anxious.
To find the cause of the onus fills urine was sent for a heavy metals test.
The test revealed still had arsenic in his system a level of sixty three is in the higher range but far from least.
Normally there is no arsenic in one system unless the person has consumed large amounts of seafood which Phil had not.
It'S a mistrust the you know of anybody that wants you that my want you dead.
I said what are you telling me.
Dr meridian suspected Phil was being poisoned.
Do not continue to exhibit arsenic in there.
Arsenic does the damage and then it's excreted from the body or to question the bomb.
So by any measure you're not going to be able to identify the actual compound itself even though the damage is there.
Phil tried to recall anything suspicious about the time he spent with his partner Steve white.
And then he remembered.
Every time he and Steve had a meal or a drink together bill's health deteriorated I noticed that several times we ate together I'd get sick after work the next day or two.
And I just kept getting sick every time we need to get out you get sick.
Even more alarming.
Steve white was a chemist by training and taught chemistry at the local high school.
As a final forensic test Dr meridian gave bill rouse very specific instructions I told him don't cut your hair and then I would be able to clip it and send it to a laboratory for analysis.
When someone is exposed to poison it goes through the body and is usually excreted by it also gets deposited in the hair root at the time of exposure.
When the hair grows out the shaft becomes an historic record of when the exposure took place.
When Phil's hair grew longer a strand was sent for an ICP test which tests for twenty two different metal components at the same time hair grows at a pretty regulated.
And someone could take the shaft of hair divided into segments.
Yeah what was present a month ago what was present two months ago depending on that piece placement on the original shaft.
The hair was cut into quarter inch pieces marked then each piece was placed in a separate file mixed with acidified water and boiled for seven hours.
The test results.
When Phil was in the hospital.
His hair showed no exposure to poison.
But prior to that when Phil was living at home Dr meridian found traces of another poison.
Mercury I believe that he was ingesting it I don't know who or why it would be delivered to him but I had no doubt that he was poisoned with heavy metals.
State law requires that police be notified when any poison is found in someone's system.
When the Bartlett police department learned of the poisoning and the financial dispute between Phil and his partner they took out a search warrant to search Steve white's home.
I thought that at that time well now we have something to look into.
And we're going to miss again as criminal matter.
In whites backyard in a storage shed they found a laboratory.
Several different jars of unusual looking powders strange looking burners and things like that that you would see in a science lab.
Leona white says the reason her husband had the lab was for their children as a way to interest them in science he would do things like mix of baking powder and vinegar to Michael volcano.
But investigators soon discovered items in the shed that were anything but child's play.
In a glass jar labeled baking powder forensic scientists found traces of mercury and arsenic.
The arsenic was a special formulation which won't be identified here except to say it was voter lists and tasteless.
Detective Bailey confronted white with the lab results and he told me that was crazy absurd and ridiculous.
He said there's no way there's arsenic in that tell you would bring it to me and I'll drink every bit of it.
A few minutes later he had said if I was going to kill this guy sure would use arsenic I do it with something much quicker and legal everything in the statement that he gave to the police a twenty one page rambling statement.
Was false and I'm not even sure if statewide is his real name.
A search of the car restoration office produced an envelope found hidden behind the electrical panel.
Analysis of the materials inside revealed arsenic antimony mercury and let each highly toxic metal.
A forensic document examiner compared the handwriting on the envelope to known samples of Steve's whites and concluded they were both similar.
Steve white was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phil Ross.
But important questions remain.
The rent check talks a colored jeep cruel fill rows had been poisoned by heavy metals and similar poisons were found in the home of his business partner Steve white.
But prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to show how bill rouse was poisoned.
We were never able to prove conclusively how he got these compounds into Mister rouses system we were able to prove the he had ample opportunity.
Still Ross recalled the number of incidents with Steve white marked by unusual behavior.
Prior to his illness and Steve were having dinner at a local restaurant.
Not long after placing their order white complained about the poor service I think I got up and went into the kitchen and came back with Phil's entree but not his own.
There was another incident involving a bottle of wine Mr white made a bottle of wine brought it to Mr rouse insisting that he drank all of it and insisting that he get the the bottle back because he wanted to give Mr Rowson.
Why would often visit feel at home share a Cup of coffee and talk about work.
But still says Steve would frequently asked Phil to get something from another room leaving Steve alone with the coffee.
Phil and chemo Coello both recalled a time when white offered to get them hamburgers for lunch after eighteen days they became a both became very ill.
And they actually made a joke about how they're never gonna says D. Y. at food again because gonna make a second.
When confronted with the evidence Steve white denied any involvement with Phil's elements.
His lawyer claimed that the accusations were circumstantial and that there was no proof white was in any way involved the defense also pointed out that the lab results showed only trace amounts of the various heavy metals in rouses body but never a lethal amount.
The prosecution claimed this was intentional that Mister white wanted Phil to die slowly after a prolonged illness so there would be no suspicions.
I hate to say ideal but it actually is the ideal way of trying to harm someone because if you're not focused or you're not suspicious of it.
The physician won't see it the fact that the work poisons found the amount of these poisons that it would take to kill Mr rouse was irrelevant the mere fact that the defendant had arsenic antimony lead.
Mercury at his disposal was the relevant facts the prosecution says the motive was money to fill rouse's death would have enabled white to get out of debt.
White had over ninety thousand dollars in credit card debt a substantial amount for a public school teacher.
The prosecution subpoenaed several waitresses from the parkland area all the tractive women with the same story they said Steve white was a very generous tipper in one instance for a fifteen dollar check white tip the waitress sixty dollars.
A hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy he paid his way out of debt if Mister ousted died he would also had inherited a hundred percent of a of a small business.
After a week long trial a jury found Steve white guilty of first degree attempted murder theft and sales tax violations he was sentenced to thirty one years in prison.
If it hadn't been for the heavy metals test and Dr meridian running all the tests on my husband he would have been dead.
His antique automobile restoration business is now closed.
To this day.
White maintains his innocence.
I couldn't believe that he has made that charge against.
I know Steve didn't.
Phil still has numbness in his extremities and is unable to walk due to nerve damage.
This guy that I know he was my business partner he's going to jail.
I don't know for how long.
I don't know why maybe cripple the rest of my life I said to families are devastated.
You tell me.
Tell me one day.
