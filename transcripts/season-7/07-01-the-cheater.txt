And like this for years.

No autopsy was performed.
Two months later it was more bad news this time.
It was Christmas time and one just gonna just returned home from his concert tour to spend the holidays with his wife and children.
Friends said that Walter didn't appear to be himself that he was.
Two days after Christmas.

The owner of the garage said Walter never arrive.
The next day.
Police found waters automobile abandoned in a parking lot at the Saint Louis airport.
None of the flight manifest listed Walter Scott as a passenger.
When Walter Scott was first reported missing.
His father wasn't terribly concerned Warner had a reputation for taking quick trips out of town.
The next day waters parents visited their son's home and was surprised by what they saw.

The search for Walter Scott continued throughout the spring and summer no family member or fellow musicians had seen or heard from him.
I had doubts I really did I had doubts that we would ever finding I held out I thought.
The last thing on my mind was that something that happened to.
Desperate for any help she confined waters mother even consulted a psychic and he told me that he's in cold cold water.
It'S not moving water.
And there's a big red.
I something red the other side of the road where he said it is not far from home.
It was then that Mrs no ties had an inkling of where water might be Jim Williams at his house.
Police search Jim Williams property but found nothing suspicious nine months after Walter disappeared Joanne filed for divorce citing abandonment and adultery.
At about the same time there was some big changes being made at the medical examiner's office in Saint Louis.
A forensic pathologist was hired to conduct autopsies on all suspicious deaths Dr merry case was the new forensic pathologist.
So they asked me if I would look at an old case that they had and they brought me this was like a two foot stack of material.
It was the Sharon Williams automobile accident case.
The car accident was rather a minimal front end collision and there was no explanation for why she should have any kind of impact injuries to the back of her head.
There were a number of suspicious elements in this accident.
The driver's side door was wide open in the driver's seat pushed back as far as it could go yes Sharon Williams was not a tall woman.
There was no damage to the cars fuel line yet a grass fire burns near the car and in the emergency room nurses reported a strong smell of gasoline on Sharon's body with so many unanswered questions Dr case ordered Sharon Williams body X..
For an autopsy.
The body told a far different story than the accident report.
There were two blunt impacts to the back of her head that caused vertical lacerations and very massive skull fracturing this is not consistent with a head on collision I'm a very minor in nature so her death was then considered a homicide.
Dr case believes that a pipe or crowbar calls these head injuries not the automobile accident.
Orchestrated Sharon's death to look like an accident.
One Sharon Williams death was ruled a homicide her ex husband Jim became the prime suspect.
Police also suspected that Walter Scott's disappearance was somehow connected by this time Walter had been missing for three years.
When police heard that Jim Williams estranged son Jimmy was serving time in a Florida prison for an unrelated crime they decided to pay him the best.
During questioning Jimmy junior made some provocative statements about three years search for Walter Scott's whereabouts.
It was kind of sarcastic he I guess was kind of making fun of the police making comments like you guys are smart enough to figure this out it was cold it without the love rivers were frozen the lake for frozen you couldn't the the ground was frozen.
What my dad get rid of the body.
He was very very suspicious that his father built a flower box over the sister and their sister has been exposed his whole life.
Police took out a warrant to search Jan Williams home the sister and was in the back yard covered with concrete.
There was a flower box on top.
Partaking in the cover of the flower boxes we immediately noticed that the system was full of water after looking down inside the system we could see what appeared to be a body floating on top of the water in the same type of jogging suit that join a reported Walter wearing the last time he was saying.
After the body was removed the cistern was strange.
There were several large concrete blocks at the bottom along with the sealed plastic bag with Walter's credit cards and driver's license.
Walter'S body was bound with a yellow world restore balance the needs were found in the ankles were bound and there was a link to that real big standing from the body they had a large loop tied in.
Surprising that it was tied to some bricks that were in the bottom the sister Walter Scott's autopsy revealed he had been shot in the back.
Because of the severe decomposition it was impossible to determine what type of weapon was used to kill all those guys financial management twenty nine to take a chance on this in the heart to them in the back.
Walter'S family believes that he was murdered at home actually the reason why every time you come in the house he took off his shoes.
When they found his body he was fully close even his socks were still on his feet No shoes.
Jim Williams was arrested and charged with the murder of both Walter Scott and his wife Sharon.
Joanne Williams was also charged in Walter's murder.
With Jim Williams and directs daughter in law awaiting trial they believe the worst was behind.
Jim Williams and Joanne Williams were tried separately for murder Jim Williams file was first.
Prosecutors believe that on October nineteenth nineteen eighty three Jim and Sharon Williams got into some kind of argument possibly about Jim's affair with Joanne the argument at some point turned violent.
She was hit twice in the back of the head fracturing her skull causing massive internal bleeding.
To make the death look like an accident.
Fire to the grass nearby and fled the scene before police arrive.
With Sharon out of the way the only ones standing between GM and Joanne was water.
Forensic evidence shows that water was shot in the back with a high velocity.
Walter'S body was placed in the cistern on Jim Williams property.
Murder weapon was never identified the ropes which bound water Scott did not match roped in the Williams garage.
However witnesses saw Jim Williams pouring concrete over the system and building the flower box a few weeks after Walker's disappearance in twenty degree weather during a snowstorm.
No one knows how water stops car its way to the airport.
How Williams got home after his wife's accident Jim Williams said he was innocent and took the stand in his own defense for the first time he revealed he had seen Walter on the night he disappeared.
But Williams had no explanation for how Walker's body mysteriously found its way into the system.
Jim Williams was convicted of two counts of capital murder and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
With only circumstantial evidence against Joanne Williams her trial never made it to court.
In a plea agreement.
Secures dropped the murder charge against Joanne in exchange for a guilty plea to the felony charge of hindering the prosecution Joanne was sentenced to five years in prison and a five thousand dollar fine.
She was released after serving only eighteen months.
In his first television interview since his arrest Jim Williams still maintains his innocence and now says his son may have had something to do with Walter's merger.
K. E. and water no ties are appalled at their former daughter in law served only eighteen months in prison.
There'S only one person.
This would ever get close enough to allow you to to killing without him even suspected and that would be Joanne and that's the reason I think that Joanne was the one that shot well.
Dot is missing by his family friends and those who love talent.
But I still don't understand how I can remember all those were.
