A security camera captured images of a nineteen year old girl and she was abducted from a convenience store.
Rancic scientists needed to find some way to improve the images for possible leads.
And the scanning electron microscope eventually identified the missing.
One of the many reasons why the state is known as the land of ten thousand.
A small town outside of.
Was home to nineteen year old Katie.
It is interesting so did her family several sports and her pet dog.
After graduating from high school in nineteen ninety eight Katie study criminal justice at a nearby community college and also became engaged to her boyfriend mark.
Katie worked as a clerk get this mostly convenience store job her mother didn't want her to take.
One night around midnight when Katie was working the night shift alone the customer called police to say that the store was open but there were no employees around.
Police to investigate.
There were no signs of violence and no money was missing from the cash register more the safe and Katie's car keys were still.
On the counter were notes with money from customers who have purchased items some time after Katie left the store.
Police wondered whether Katie might have left the store with a friend.
The store had four security cameras focused on various areas.
At eleven thirty eight PM the security cameras revealed complications forcing Katie out of the front door into the parking lot.
The pictures were.
There were no security cameras outside the store to photograph the get away vehicle.
The store was located near a major highway which meant the kidnapper could have left the area at high speed.
Neighbors near the store told police they saw a black pickup truck circling the area before Katie's abduction.
And an employee at the sandwich shop next to the convenience store told police she had seen the same black pickup truck in the parking lot about three hours before Katie vanished.
She said the driver was glaring inappropriately as female customers left the store.
The employee wrote down what she could remember of the license plate.
She said it was a Minnesota license plate and that the first three digits were five five seven.
She also recalled the last letter on the plate was a black pickup truck.
Also find Katie.
Minnesota National Guard helicopters searched the area for nineteen year old eighty point.
On the ground dozens of community volunteers joined police in the search.
With each passing day and no word from the kidnapper hopes started to fade Katie would be found alive.
Police search their database for black pickup trucks registered in the state of Minnesota with the license plate beginning with five five seven ending with the letter Y..
Surprisingly there were hundreds of vehicles matching that description.
Surveillance video captured images of the man who abducted Katie from the convenience store.
The quality of the pictures and the images distorted to clearly identify the kidnapper.
To improve the pictures police sent the tapes to NASA which has many years of experience trying to improve pictures sent from space.
Solar physicist Dr David Hathaway created a process to enhance video images called this song.
Dr Hathaway says a video picture is really two different fields that create one picture.
These two fields change so rapidly the human I can't discern.
Doctor has the week combined the even and odd frames so that could be the same time creating twice the number of lines of resolution.
In one of those freeze frame images Dr Hathaway was able to isolate the kidnapper.
When he removes some of the grain in the picture you could see that the man at short blonde or grey hair was approximately five feet ten inches tall with an average build and he wore a dark New York Yankees baseball Jersey with the number twenty three on the back.
Unfortunately even this new technique could not produce a clear image of the kidnappers face.
Using what they have a police sketch artist released a rough drawing along with the physical description including his clothing to the media.
Hundreds of tips poured into police.
One of those led to Donald dean Christiansen who had a past conviction on a sex offense.
Christiansen had been free at the time of Katie's abduction.
Donald dean Christiansen had several too including a large one on his left forearm.
The security camera video revealed the kidnapper had no tattoo on his forearm.
Three weeks after Katie's dispatcher Paula Francisco answered a telephone call from a citizen who had a two.
It was a lead number one thousand nine hundred and sixty.
The caller worked in Minnesota veterans home in Minneapolis and was suspicious there who had just quit his name was Donald Shelton block.
One was fifty years old married and the father of four children.
A background check showed the blonde had prior convictions for assault rape and kidnapping dating back to the nineteen seventies.
His last conviction was in nineteen eighty three when Blom had forced to young women into the woods at nine point five to a tree.
Fortunately the girl's escape before they were sold.
Check the motor vehicles revealed Blom did not own a black pickup truck as witnesses describe the least search.
When police descended upon the home of Donald Blom.
They found no trace of.
One said he was innocent and that he had an alibi for the night if Katie's disappearance.
When investigators learned vacation property near moose lake they search their two.
Once again there was no sign of Katie but investigators noticed large fire.
Technicians sifted the fire for trace evidence and.
Several small items that appeared to be.
The forensic anthropologist Dr Susan Thurston Meister to examine the fragments she says.
Differs from animal.
The cross section of human as a circular pattern animal bones is linear.
Dr Meister examine the human bone fragments to determine the age and sex of the victim.
This part of the pelvis called the pubic symphysis was key.
The bone headed up to use angles greater than ninety degrees indicative of a female.
And the oval surface was heavily ridged characteristic of a young adult.
Skull fragments also help determine the victim's age.
The joints or sutures of the skull bones were open.
Skull sutures typically closed around age thirty five.
Dr Meister concluded the remains were those of the young woman.
While the findings were consistent with Katie poor your it was far from a positive identification.
The bones were too badly damaged for DNA testing and collectively represented only twenty five percent of the human skeleton.
Several fragments also were recovered from slums fire.
Investigators called in forensic odontology just doctor and Orlando who specializes in making identification based on dental X. ray.
Was the largest and most of those.
When she compared to KD players dental records she saw that the shape and size were consistent with Katie's lower left second motor known as number eighteen.
And she noticed something else what looked to be ran into two doctor nor lander ask forensic scientist at the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension to conduct an analysis of the building.
The rent checks scientist mark Nielsen used a scanning electron microscope to magnify the filling so that it was thousands of times larger.
The microscope bombards an isolated section of the sample with an electron.
And the different elements will react to the beam different.
X. rays revealed the elemental composition of the sample.
The results showed that the filling material in the tooth was highly unusual.
It contained zirconia and silicon in concentrations never seen before in dental cement.
When scientists contacted Katie players dentist Dr Melanie Meyer.
She told them something interesting.
records indicated she had replaced filling in Katie's number eighteen two weeks before the adoption.
Dr Myers said she used a brand new material not yet on the market.
The material was a sample called rely X. which had been given to her at the dental conference.
Dr Meyer told investigators we live at this was factored by the three M. company headquartered in Minnesota.
When contacted by police chemist at three M. said rely on teen concentrations of two elements zirconium and selling.
In the same concentrations that were found in the two.
In the garage one of Donald blossoms properties was the black pickup truck with the same license plate police were looking for.
Donald Blom was arrested and charged with murder.
When confronted with the scanning electron microscope findings blonde confessed to Katie's murder during a taped conversation with special agent Phil Wagner.
Donald Blom recanted claiming the confession was coerced.
Prosecutors know that was in the vicinity of the convenience store that day because his credit card receipt show he purchased liquor nearby around five PM.
The sandwich shop employees all.
Customers in the parking lot around eight PM three hours before Katie was a.
Long may have seen the van and returned at eleven thirty entering the store when she was alive.
Prosecutors explain the scientific evidence to the jury a special their smoking gun.
A dental filling material in the two identified as Katie.
The material which was so limited in distribution it wasn't on the market.
The jury understood the scanning electron analysis.
Donna was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison without.
The verdict is little solace for the players.
As a result of this case Minnesota lawmakers pass which includes.
Better ways for police to track.
Now requires that at least two workers are on duty each shift.
