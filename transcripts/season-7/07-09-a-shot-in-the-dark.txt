Ernestine Pereira was found dead in her bedroom with a single gunshot.
The gun was by her side.
After examining the forensic evidence her death was ruled a homicide.
Could that same evidence be interpreted differently.
One man's life.
In nineteen seventy nine Martin three oz entered the United States illegally from Mexico looking for work.
Freeross landed a job at a local marble processing plant in the rural town of Wheatland Wyoming.
Two years later he met twenty four year old Ernestine Pereira a divorcee with a young daughter.
They had two children of their own a boy and a girl.
Ernestina Martin decided to live together and rented a mobile home on the edge of town.
But they also fought mostly over insignificant matters says mark.
On July fifth nineteen eighty four Ernestine spent the entire day out with her children and didn't arrive home until ten thirty that night.
Mark put the children to bed while Ernestine went to sleep in the couple's bedroom.
That night free all slept on the sofa bed in the living room.
Around one o'clock in the morning Priya's was awakened by one of the children cry.
She was saying mommy mommy it up.
Ernestine was dead from a gunshot wound.
So Cola call for an ambulance and call the police there was no evidence of a break in.
There was no evidence of anybody else being out of the trailer other than two small children I believe a four year old and a baby.
When questioned at the scene for ya slide saying he wasn't home when Ernestine were shocked.
Free also may have had reason to lie.
Police record showed that the sheriff had been called to his home several times for domestic disturbances.
On a number of occasions Ernestine said that Martin had hit her.
A forensic analysis revealed that free office printer prints were all over the rifle and there was more evidence even more damning.
When Ernestine Pereira was found dead of a gunshot wound her common law husband Martin free also denied he was home when the shooting occurred.
But he later changed his story and admitted he was home that night.
Investigators discovered that Ernestine was with some male friends earlier on the day she died she had been wrestling in the grass she'd been drinking with these friends.
And also that Martin free us had it evidently written by the park at that time and very possibly may have seen them.
Three are said Ernestine had come home drunk test to prove this correct her blood alcohol level was point two six two and a half times the legal limit.
He also said they weren't getting along and had stopped sleeping together.
We knew there had been problems between the two of them he was sleeping out on the couch in the living room at that time he'd been banished from the bedroom.
Although he said he was sleeping down the hall he claimed he never heard the gun go off.
He told investigators he was sleeping on the couch at the other end of the hallway in the trailer and it sometime during the night about the time when it's believed that the gun went off he said he heard what he thought to be a twig breaking at night and he heard that too many went back to sleep.
Riaz said Ernestine committed suicide.
Next to Ernestine's body was a high powered three hundred magnum hunting rifle which belong to free us his fingerprints were on the rifle Ernestine's fingerprint was found on the scope.
pants were ripped near the zipper and the button had been pulled off indicating some sort of struggle.
Ernestine had a large wound in her abdomen and a much smaller wound in her back.
Since exit wounds are generally larger than entrance wounds the coroner was certain Ernestine had been shot in the back.
Ford had entered through a wound which is a little less than a half inch in size and struck the vertebrae had gone through the body and had come out through the abdomen on the French side also supporting the homicide.
Was the evidence on Ernestine's blouse on the inside of the shirt there were copious amounts of course blood and tissue but I also found bone fragments and lead fragments from the bullet as it was disintegrating passing through the body.
Dr stone says Ernestine was shot from behind the autopsy results found the same.
The results of that autopsy confirmed that the bullet had entered the back and had exited out the front.
And there was no gunshot residue on the front of the blouse which would have been president had she committed suicide.
They did not find any evidence of that in the front or the back of the blouse.
And that indicated that the weapon was at least some thirty inches to three feet away.
According to their their findings.
Free Austin denied he murdered his wife and pointed to the fact that his right arm was broken and he wasn't able to maneuver the rifle himself.
Never the less Ernestine's death was ruled a homicide.
Based on the forensic evidence prosecutors believe that Priya's and Ernestine fox when she arrived home.
As Ernestine was getting up from the floor prosecutors say free awesome shot her in the back.
Blood spurted out of her stomach and struck the wall in front of her.
As she fell to the floor her body twisted in reaction to the shop and she landed on her back.
Prosecutors say free also left the rifle on the ground to make it appear that death was a suicide.
They didn't believe Priya's cast would have hindered his ability to fire the weapon.
I feel that the whole world fell on top of me it was just like a real nightmare had I was sick that's why me what do I mean.
I can I was shocked I was shocked completely.
Mark Priya's was charged with his wife's murder.
Since he couldn't afford an attorney the court appointed one for.
At the time the state public defender's office use the state crime lab the very same lab used by the prosecution.
They had already ruled Ernestine's death was a homicide.
Riaz is attorney tried to come up with an alternative explanation for Ernestine staff but he couldn't.
We felt bad about how the trial was going to go I remember a.
Public defender investigator named Walt Carol and I talking before the trial started about who the grim prospect it looked like from my team.
And they were right.
The jury convicted free us of second degree murder and sentenced him to twenty five to thirty five years in prison.
The story doesn't end there.
After the murder conviction the Martin free us his attorney Robert Moxley started gathering information to file an appeal.
Meanwhile Moxley started to have misgivings about the competency of the state's pathologist who had performed the autopsy.
Just in this case was not qualified to do forensic cases.
It'S probably been terrible.
So he asked doctor Robert lance an independent gunshot residue expert to test Ernestine's blouse.
I'Ve used a much more sophisticated much more modern technology called scanning electron microscopy with X. ray emissions and what this does is it provides much better sensitivity for gunshot residue what this told me it was the gunshot residue had come from the front very clearly and had to follow the bullet right on through.
Her abdomen and come off the back.
This contradicted tests done by the state crime lab which found no evidence of gunshot residue anywhere on the block.
Or it's possible to do just a little bit wrong and not find any gunshot residue.
Suddenly free Austin's story that Ernestine had committed suicide didn't seem so far fetched yes Priya's remain behind bars.
After two years in prison Wyoming Supreme Court granted free us a new trial.
But the defense had their work cut out for.
Prosecutors ordered Ernestine's body X. he owned for a second autopsy.
The chief medical examiner for Houston Texas Dr Charles petty perform this one.
The results of the second autopsy were the same as the first the bullet and Ernestine sit back and came out through her stomach.
I think that the evidence showed at that time and still does in my mind today that Martin free us shot and murdered Ernestine Pereira.
The defense introduced some new evidence in the second trial.
That Ernestine was suicidal and slash marks on her wrist.
She had tried to kill herself numerous times before.
I was able to document between the different stories and medical records somewhere between five and maybe a dozen prior suicide attempts or suicide gestures.
Moxley attacked the heart of the prosecution's case.
The first point was free asas contention but he didn't hear the gunshot from the living room.
Acoustics expert Dr Harry Holly provided an explanation.
Pauline conducted a test using the body of a dead horse covered with a fabric similar to Ernestine's blouse with the three hundred magnum rifle similar to free offices right.
The first shot three feet away from the horse was very loud.
When the gun was fired in the open we got a deep field readings of somewhere between a hundred and ten and a hundred and twenty D. B. which and it sounded like gunfire.
When the muscles placed against the skin and material it sounded very different.
The gun shot doesn't sound like gunfire it sounds like someone kicking the side of a building or kicking a piece of furniture and the energy level is quite low.
The sound of a similar to what free almost described on the night of his wife's death.
Judy bunker a blood spatter expert analyzed the blood evidence on the wall only eighteen inches from the floor.
She says it clearly shows Ernestine was sitting on the floor with the rifle to our stomach when the shot was fired.
The bullet fragments in the wall their location along with the blood spatter location across the wall and given the location of her words would indicate that she was either.
Kneeling or sitting when the shot was fired.
And she found no blood spatter evidence to suggest as prosecutors contended that Ernestine was shot in the back then twisted in the air while falling to the floor.
I learned from Judith bunker that if somebody gets shot and spins around that you know they spew vital fluids around.
But there was no blood spatter on the floor walls or the bad from the twisting motion the prosecution says occur.
The defense theory was clearly suicide.
Ernestine held the muscle of the rifle to our stomach with one hand then leaned over and push the trigger with the other.
Prosecution experts said there was a problem with that there.
Has this weapon used in contact with the body at the time of discharge that I would have expected that there would have been bloody hand or tissue on the muzzle of the weapon and there was none.
Dr Vincent Tamayo an expert in high velocity gunshot wounds testified for the defense.
The absence of blood on the on the web that means absolutely nothing.
Maybe half times with hand guns you don't find blood on the muscle it's a little more common in shockers website but don't forget with rifles and in this situation who had called it in between.
Dr Tamayo also believes that the autopsy photos clearly show that Ernestine was shot in the stomach.
That'S about fourteen to fifteen hundred grease.
If you put the muzzle of the gun against the body.
Then you're going to have this.
And the flame burns and then the effects of gas if you look at the wound in the abdomen there's so and there's flame burns that means the bustle was in contact with the body the type of discharge therefore this has to be the entrance.
And doctor Tamayo says the gas discharge from the rifle temporarily inflated Ernestine's abdomen with enough force that it ripped her jeans contrary to the prosecution's claim that they were born during the fight.
Prosecution experts testified as they did in the first trial but they found no gunshot residue on the blouse supporting their claim that Ernestine was at least three feet away when the gun was fired.
The defense presented their new scanning electron microscope evidence of gun powder residue on the black.
And with that.
The defense rested their case.
In Martin free offices second murder trial there were two very different theories presented to the jury.
The prosecution theory was that Martin Priya's shop Ernestine in the back she was getting up from the floor after a fight.
After the shot Ernestine twisted as she fell to the floor which explains why she was found on her back.
The defense maintained that Ernestine was sitting on the floor the rifle was upside down she used one hand to hold the muscle against her stomach and the other to push the trigger.
During deliberations the jury wanted to see if the woman Ernestine size could accomplish what the defense that happened.
There was a small woman on the second jury I took the gun into the jury room and she sat down on the floor and and replicated my two year.
And she told me later that her finger had touched that that scope on that rifle exactly where Ernestine's fingerprinted been same line after two and a half hours the jury had a verdict.
I don't question the wisdom of the jury.
I can see where they may not have been sure.
Who had the accurate opinion who had the accurate theory and there's no question in the criminal justice system as it should be that.
If there's a tie or even anything close to a tie that.
You know it's beyond a reasonable doubt and I think the jury didn't equip Martin free us because they felt he was innocent.
But I believe that they quit in because you know they could not find that he was guilty beyond any reasonable doubt.
We hug each other and danced around the court room a little bit.
It was a good moment.
Marquee free awesome now lives in southern California.
He is now an American citizen and has tried to get custody of his children but they remain with Ernestine's mother in Wyoming.
On the area got a good job I can't complain I make money.
That little girl.
The forensic experts who assisted Robert Moxley in the second trial did so without remuneration.
The forensic community rallied around me in this case to make sure that I got the help I needed to find the expertise I needed and they were just all kinds of people out there committed to making sure that justice got down in this case.
