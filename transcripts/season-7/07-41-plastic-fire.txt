Police say that this car crash which killed an elderly woman was murdered ten dollars.
The driver at the victim's daughter insisted it was an accident.
Fire investigators came to entirely different conclusions.
Was it an accident or murder.
Me good Georgia is literally a one stoplight town.
Surrounded by peanut farms and cotton fields.
On August eighteenth nineteen ninety six haha quiet Sunday a man driving down a remote country road saw a woman standing on a small bridge waving frantically.
The woman was Sheila Bryan.
Thanks god jumped out of the car and he said what's the matter what's matter most said.
The car was down in a ditch and she was eighty two year old mother was trapped inside from the bridge you could see the smoke coming out of the car.
The man ran to a nearby house to get help.
By the time firefighters arrived.
When the fire was put out.
They found Frieda weeks today inside the car she had been unable to get out I just remember getting castigated thrown up in the next thing I remember is.
It'S just lots of people.
Sheila told police that she and her mother were on their way to the local cemetery to visit her father's grave.
She said she was momentarily distracted and accidentally drove off the road into the ditch just before reaching the bridge.
It'S about a thirty foot embankment which is very state and when I get to the bottom there was a big joke.
I was trying to get to.
Kerr turned off and it wouldn't turn off.
Sheila ran around the car to the passenger side door to try to get her mother out but the door was locked.
She said she ran up the embankment and flagged down a passing vehicle.
She said when she looked down she saw smoke coming out of the car for the first time when police arrived they noticed some irregularities that card traveled about sixty feet down the grassy shoulder of the road prior to making a right hand turn and traveling about thirty feet down this embankment where it came to its final resting point perpendicular to the road in the ditch and then we started looking at there were no skid marks there were no signs in the grassy shoulder that there was an abrupt turn of any type.
And the front of the vehicle showed no signs of damage consistent with running down an embankment.
There were no scrape marks under the bumper under the under carriage the plastic caroling under the bumper had no damage to it whatsoever all signs that were indicative that this car travel down that embankment very slowly.
The door to the gas tank was open and the gas cap was missing.
No autopsy was performed on free two weeks but the toxicology results were puzzling.
Most people who die from smoke inhalation have carbon monoxide levels in their blood a forty five to eighty five percent.
But the carbon monoxide level in free does blood was zero lab results showed that there was no carbon monoxide in the victim's blood which could be indicative that she was not alive at the time of the fire.
Frieda weeks was dead before the fire started.
How did she die.
The local sheriff's department brought in outside experts to help investigate the car accident and fire which killed Fredo weeks.
The engine and exhaust system showed little fire damage but the passenger compartment was destroyed.
It appeared that the fire started on the floor of the driver's side because investigators found burn patterns consistent with the use of an excellent they're also burn patterns that.
Traded through or over the driver's door threshold which could be indicative that the door was open at some point during the time of the fire.
The debris inside the car was tested for Exelon's but tests came back negative.
It'S not uncommon in arson cases especially where fire departments have responded but a tremendous amount of water on the actual fire scene.
The only personal items found in the car were a wallet and the charred remains of a claw hammer.
The possibility that the hammer might have been the murder weapon led investigators to exhume free two weeks body for an autopsy that's when I heard that they were suspicious arson.
You could not me over with a feather.
I mean I just could not even believe where they couldn't come up with that.
And the investigation angered Sheila's husband to Mister Brian became more upset and made the statement that you guys need to do whatever you need to do and you need to do it because there's a hundred thousand dollars at stake in the insurance companies knocking a painting you get done with your investigation.
Sheila'S husband was referring to the liability coverage of this car insurance which he believed would pay them a hundred thousand dollars for free to staff which Canaccord bonded with the amount he told us there in his driveway.
The autopsy found no injuries consistent with the use of a claw hammer.
The surprising news was at Freda's lungs and nasal passages did not have any sort which usually happens when someone is a live and breathe smoke during a fire.
The medical examiner found evidence of severe coronary artery disease and listed the probable cause of Freda's death as cardiac standstill.
Dr Clark said that she was probably alive at the time of the fire in may have taken one or two gasps after that fire was started and then die.
The medical examiner did not rule the day.
On the side.
Never the less prosecutors believe that the fire was deliberately set and charred Sheila Bryan with arson and murder.
She looked flat not guilty.
Secure said the motive for the crime was money Sheila killed her mother and staged the crime scene to collect a death benefit from her car insurance.
That'S ridiculous so this is something that you're required to have my loan to be able to drive a vehicle.
And there was no way for me to even collecting money from them.
Prosecutors knew that the car insurance wouldn't have paid anything after Freda's death but believed that Sheila and her husband were unaware of that at the time of the incident.
To prove it prosecutors pointed to the statement Sheila's husband allegedly made to investigators was the state's position that they intended to collect on that insurance money and the reason the state thought that is first because what Carlos Bryant told them that that was their intention and secondly because they had hired an attorney to collect the money at the trial Sheila took the stand in her own defense her testimony however differed in some respects from the statement she gave to police immediately after the accident but she got on the stand she told the story about stopping on the edge of the embankment and teetering I was sitting there and I said I was gonna try and get out I was in the car door still have mostly failed on an idea Carter come back and hit my arm.
And then the car rolled down the ditch bank.
Not anything that she had said at the time of the accident.
She left first told investigators that her mother showed no signs of distress after the accident on the witness stand she said her mother wasn't responsive.
I told my losses I'll be back in just a minute she didn't respond well I thought she had passed out.
When she got on the witness stand that story had changed remarkably and I think it didn't ring true to those jurors.
But it was testimony about the burn patterns that I think silver plate.
The prosecution's arson experts said those burn patterns were consistent with the fire started with the next element.
The jury found Sheila Bryan guilty of arson and murder she was sentenced to life in prison I could not believe that this actually happened as of one one am I here.
I don't understand I even looked around for a prestige group to cut my wrist I said I cannot let my children.
And then all of a sudden something come over me and I said god if I'm here to help somebody thank you show me what you want me to do.
And I had a piece about me after a after that.
Sheila'S friends and supporters believed in her innocence and raise funds to hire an independent fire investigator to look into the case and the person they found also happened to be an outspoken critic of arson investigations Dr Gerald Hurst.
You had a woman who had a close relationship with her mother and plenty of people who know about this relationship they said that the reason that she had charged her mother was because the mother was getting old wearing a diaper and she was just too much trouble.
Say just doesn't fit.
It was clear to me that this case had divided that community in this area half believing she was guilty and half believing that she was innocent.
After Sheila Bryan was convicted of murdering her mother in a car fire Sheila's friends and family hired Dr Gerald Hurst to conduct an independent investigation I read the original investigation reports and all of the police work done in connection.
With the the fire and then I read the trial testimony and I found that there was a lot of bunco involved in the prosecution.
She loves the car was a Ford first and his colleague Chris bloom quickly discovered that there had been a number of suspicious fires in similar Ford vehicles.
The problem was the ignition switch a box of electrical contacts on the steering column.
By turning the key different contacts in the switch starts the car and turns on the electrical system and it's a small little component you don't normally would even think about it but that little component has been the source of at least alleged eight thousand fires.
Many of these cars caught fire while sitting in garages and parking lots and some while being driven down the road.
In nineteen ninety six Ford issued one of the largest car recalls in history a lead in the ignition switch had electricity flowing through it constantly a plastic box separated the lease but in some cases carbon build up because the circuit to arc it's creating a circuit where circuit was not designed and and as a result there's overheating that's occurring and that overheating will result in the mission of the surrounding combustibles plastics and such.
Dr Hurst and Chris bloom made another interesting discovery.
The task force at the Ford Motor Company that confirmed the ignition switch problem was headed by Ralph Neil.
Mr Newell was also a fire expert and was the star witness for the prosecution in Sheila's trial.
I'M not saying that he did anything wrong but I'm saying he was under heavy influence he was getting I think about a hundred and fifty thousand a year or at least that year and certain amounts in other years.
working for Ford Motor Company the key thing I noted was that not a single person.
Mention the ignition switch in the case.
And it didn't matter whether they said I examine the mission switch and eliminated as because I looked at the mission switch there was nothing wrong there was no mention of it.
This was particularly interesting since she was first statement to police mentioned her inability to remove her car keys after the accident.
Brian after running off the road trying to get the keys out of the ignition and couldn't get the keys out.
That indicates that they have something wrong with the ignition lock or the mission switch Sheila's Kerr was in nineteen eighty seven Ford cougar but the recall only went back to nineteen eighty eight.
Lumen Dr Hurst suspected Sheila's car had the same ignition switch.
This is a recalled switch from an eighty eight Ford escort the important thing to note is.
The model number on the switch when I pulled the large wiring loom for.
Out of the eighty seven cougar.
And examined this which.
You can see the model numbers are the same.
What caused the burn patterns in the in which prosecution experts said was from an excel.
This during column cover and carpet from the same model and year car I Sheila Brian's.
Gerald Hurst believes the switch inside the steering column over here and the plastic cover ignite it melted and dripped like this one burning down through the carpet like a liquid excel.
He would also begin dripping the same molten flaming plastic on the state.
Which contains polyurethane foam and that would take off like the proverbial house of fire.
Any time a fire consumes the interior of a car you're going to have masses of flammable plastics that melt and flow they themselves the plastics become ineffective liquid X. elements.
First also said the gap in the door seal allowed melted plastic from the seats doors and dashboard to flow under the door in not one but two spots.
It was not a liquid excel rent that produced it I am quite confident was a plastic but that was of less importance to me than the fact that the prosecutor and all the king's horses and all the king's men would not be able to produce that pattern with gasoline.
The information should have been presented to the jury.
Hey this is a known problem that it's a rare problem but it's a known problem that catches fire.
After ten months in prison.
The Georgia Supreme Court unanimously voted to overturn Sheila's conviction.
The court stated the testimony that inferred there was an insurance motive was improper and any financial motive was tenuous at best.
It does not happen in the length of time for me to even get.
Usually people stay in there for years and years before they even get a pale.
Just a Sheila was released from prison.
She had another surprise.
Prosecutors for the state of Georgia said they would try her again for murder and arson.
Due to extensive publicity the second trial would be held in neighboring Thomas county.
And it was quite naturally a battle of the experts.
But which experts with the jury believe.
Converse right was the new defense attorney representing Sheila Bryan after a second murder trial.
If the jury.
Accepted that then that would that into the case right there.
But the cause of the fire was again the prosecution's focus claiming Sheila Bryan had set the car fire by pouring and lighting some type of liquid excel around it either came out of the tank but she brought it there is no container.
This time she list defense relied on doctor Hearst's opinion for what caused the deadly fire an expert witness in a case perform several functions obviously he testifies in his expert opinion they also can help prepare cross examination by pointing out.
Ralph Neil the prosecution's star witness in the first trial admitted he had worked for the Ford Motor Company on the task force investigating Ford's past ignition switch problems.
But you'll insisted he eliminated the switch in Sheila's car as the cause of the fire.
No limited however that he did not photograph or document his analysis of the switch in his report.
Without the insurance motive.
Prosecution argued that Sheila had grown tired of caring for her eighty two year old mother they were all one close knit family the testimony was.
After a four day trial.
The jury deliberated for just under three hours before finding Sheila Bryan not guilty.
I just thank you lord.
Failing and she did ten months in jail for some shouldn't do all you can side is an example of the system succeeding.
Two different trials two different verdicts.
The town of omega will never be the same.
They were heated debates about her guilt or innocence up until the first child and they continued of course after she was convicted and what to present an F. and they continue to this day.
But Sheila Bryan is a free woman.
And gives the credit to forensic science what made the difference having a very credible expert.
That I believe in what he was doing and what he was saying.
This was a case of.
The medical automobile this is what this case is all about surprise.
