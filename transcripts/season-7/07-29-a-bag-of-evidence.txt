By Justin anonymous telephone calls police where they could find the body of a missing nine year old girl.
The recording of that call too much static and background noise for voice identification until forensic scientists worked their magic.
Which led investigators to a factory a supermarket and straight to the front door of a suspect.
On the Friday before Easter in nineteen ninety six nine year old Jessica not spent the day playing reading and drawing.
The kids are home from school I spent the day packing up close and getting ready for a trip that we had planned to make to my husband's parents house and spend the Easter weekend with them eventually Jessica wanted to go outside to play and wait for her father to come home she said I'd like to go downstairs.
And wait for dad because my husband was out shopping for Easter goodies I said fine you know don't go anywhere else.
A couple of hours later Kevin Knox walked in the front door but without Jessica.
And it was starting to get dark and he said where's Jessica I said didn't you see here she was she said she was right out front he said now.
Kevin and Peggy not searched everywhere one neighbor said she saw Jessica sitting outside reading a few hours earlier but hadn't seen her since.
When police were notified of Jessica's disappearance they instituted a parameter search of the area.
Their first real lead was an anonymous telephone call saying that Jessica could be found not far from her home on Montgomery road.
And then the call originated from the pay phone at a gas station on Montgomery world.
No one was there when police arrived.
Prime scene investigator Deanna to Minsky was called to the area.
While I was in route to the Mobil gas station they called me and informed me they had found a body of a juvenile female.
The body was in a dark isolated area near a water system pump house.
Order a mile from where the telephone call was made.
She was partially covered with a dark plastic garbage bags.
And there were a couple of magazines a mayor around her.
It was Jessica not.
I think this detective Rodriguez I was sitting on the sofa in my living room and he came in and I just knew he said I found your daughter.
And I knew that she was gone at that point some.
That was the worst night of.
I still have a hard time accepting it.
Deanna to Minsky search the area for possible forensic evidence.
Jessica'S clothing was intact except for one missing show.
It appeared that she then placed it there that she was not killed there because our items underneath her as well as on top of her and there was a drag mark in the sand that corresponded with her left shoulder.
There was a tire impression nearby which police photographed then cast with plaster for future evaluation.
The body was carefully removed for an autopsy along with the plastic garbage bag in which the body was found.
The first thing I try to do is to try to eliminate people who know her how could she have gotten away from there without raising a ruckus you have to wonder how in the world that it even happened that no one could see it so the first thing to do obviously is to look at family when questioned by police neither Jessica's mother Peggy nor her husband Kevin were able to provide an alibi for the time Jessica's disappearance.
Kevin said he was shopping trip thank you said she was inside cleaning her house but neither could provide any independent corroboration.
In Kevin Knox vehicles police found the role of garbage bags which were confiscated for forensic analysis.
And it was something else suspicious an analysis of the anonymous call to police revealed the tone of the caller's voice as sympathetic suggesting that the caller knew Jessica person.
If investigators could identify the caller.
The most likely had their killer.
The autopsy of nine year old Jessica Knoch revealed bruising on her neck and the inside of her mouth indicating someone had to hand over her mouth and suffocated her.
And be sure whether it was strangulation or whether it was suffocation because of a hand over the mouse probably a combination of the two and the contents of her stomach revealed she had eaten a fast food hamburger shortly before she was killed.
How can you treat a human.
Like a piece of trash I mean literally you put her in a garbage bag and dumped around under a tree I think it plus they found her I mean.
That really makes me angry extremely angry.
Ryland analyzed the bag covering Jessica he found no fingerprints on it and also determined that the bag was different from the type found in Jessica's father's truck.
This is eliminated Kevin not as a possible suspect.
They asked to interview me right off the bat when I understood it was pretty hard but it had to be done.
The trace evidence found on Jessica's body hairs fibers and other materials were sent to forensic scientist Max how.
He immediately identified important information about the killer.
The foreign hair found on Jessica's body was Caucasian.
And there were two different types of fibers both were Matt finish very thick and rough not the type used in closing there's a certain look to carpet fibers means a certain look to automotive fibers and if you look at enough of them you can eventually get a hunch if you will that it may be in fact from an automobile either the carpeting or maybe the floor mats the fibers were from two different carpets suggesting that Jessica had been in two different locations.
And there was another telling piece of trace evidence.
And then there is the overwhelming number of animal here's the animal hairs were distinctive as to what type of animal they were from the dog dogs have what's called a spade shaped route and also kind of looks like a small Christmas tree sort of folded up in triangular in shape.
How then compared that dog here to reference samples from the F. B. I. laboratory I knew it wasn't going to be a malamute or you know some Alaskan husky so I went to short haired dogs black labs Sharpay's Boston terriers dogs like that that have very short sleek coats and then started comparing the characteristics all the other dogs dropped out except for shar pei.
All of this evidence told investigators that the killer was Caucasian and that he took Jessica Ennis automobile to a fast food restaurant.
Later Jessica was in another location when she came into contact with the shar pei dog.
Police then turned their attention to the anonymous telephone calls.
The nine one one tape obviously a key piece of evidence everyone was convinced the person on that tape was the murderer and we wanted to be able to identify that voice.
The call had been made from a public telephone at a gas station.
And quite a bit of background noise and staff.
Police sent the tape to NASA asking scientists there to use the same audio techniques they employed to clean up audio transmissions from space.
After that was complete the tape was sent to doctor Harry holding a renowned forensic audio analyst who literally wrote the book on forensic audio analysis.
Dr holding felt certain he could identify the voice on the telephone call all he needed was a suspect's voice for comparison.
The tone of the caller's voice sounded to investigators as sympathetic as if he knew Jessica personally.
On a hunch.
He'S played the tape for Jessica's mother and her reaction was immediate my first reaction was this voice is very familiar to me and I think I had to listen to it a few times before I realized this out it it was like a bell ringing in my head that's it it's the guy with the door.
The guy with the dog was a neighbor she just couldn't recall his name.
In their grief friends and neighbors left Lindley's and toy rabbits were Jessica Knox body was found on Easter weekend.
Meanwhile Jessica's mother had provided police with the suspect.
She said the man who called police pointing them to Jessica's body sounded like a neighbor who walked his dog in the area.
Police identified the man as thirty five year old James Edward crow who had no prior arrests.
Kroll lived with his wife was a nurse he was unemployed and spent quite a bit of time walking his dog can he stay home and watch the house and the dog and walk the dog around and talk to all the kids now that's not the worst thing in the world in some situations but it certainly makes you wonder something about him made me feel uncomfortable but it's not a thought that I dwelled on.
I'M can was a shar peis similar to the breed whose hair was found on Jessica's body.
A neighbor had seen crow talking to Jessica outside the apartment building shortly before she disappeared.
Crowe admitted talking to or but denied having anything to do with her disappearance.
Amid the debris they found a bag for a kid's meal from a nearby fast food restaurant.
Remnants of the fast food hamburger had been found in Jessica's stomach.
The crew had brand new tires on his truck.
Police discovered that Crowe had replaced them just after Jessica's death.
And didn't close apartment police found a box of black garbage bags the same size and brand as the bag found with Jessica's body.
Could they linked the garbage bag from the crime scene to the garbage bags and crow's apartment.
There are a huge number of garbage bags but it's typically on the order of nine and a half million bags in one month's time so the question is how many of those nine million bags could be like this bag found on Jessica knobs body.
To find out investigators turned to knoll Roberts.
As a quality control expert from the manufacturer he knows garbage bags.
Robert said that the number stamped on the box indicated where the back had been made.
The bags and crow's apartment had been made in Virginia.
The goal of mass production is to quickly make an identical product over and over again.
But Roberts knew that not every trash bag was truly identical.
Invited Scott Ryland and prosecutor Chris white to the plant to understand how the manufacturing process worked how plastic is recycled melted blown into a huge queue that cools as it descends and then made into rolls of thin sheets that are cut and fold it into bags.
Manufacturers use a variety of materials to make the bags including scraps you're taking a random amount of white plastic bags of yellow ties that have iron in the white plastic bags are very rich in titanium dioxide so what you have depending on this random variation in the scrap that's being used a change in the concentration of the iron and the titanium and in fact it turns out from day to day.
To reveal the elements in the plastic Scott Ryland focused on high intensity X. ray beam on samples of the bags found in crows apartment.
A fluorescence spectrometer reveals the elements in the plastic and their relative concentrations.
The bag found with Jessica was virtually identical to the bags and crow's department indicating they had been from the same batch of plastic.
Another characteristic was visible to the naked eye when the plastic is made bits of debris will get large in the machinery this produces imperfections in the plastic called die lines.
Because the obstructions causing the lines come and go the pattern on the bags is unique to a specific window of time and it almost gives you a fingerprint type identification where you can take one bag in really match it up with the next back in a carton and be pretty sure that it is a consecutive bag and from the same batch.
The dye lines in the bags found in prose apartment lined up with the guidelines in the bag from the crime scene meaning all the bags were manufactured within hours of each other.
Often the bags are not folded evenly the amount of overlap in the edges called an offset varies over time and with each machine you.
The offset in crows bags in the bag with Jessica's body also matched.
I think most people would say wow we're not dealing with thirty two to thirty four actual boxes but it narrows it down to half that number.
Probably realistically sixteen to seventeen boxes bags out there as potential sources.
Meaning that there was one in seventeen chance that the garbage bag came from the crows apartment.
James Edward Crowe was arrested and charged with the murder of nine year old Jessica knocked.
forensic scientists were able to determine that the carpet fibers found on Jessica's body were consistent with the carpet fibers in James pros apartment and in his automobiles.
And the dog care on Jessica's body was consistent with crows dog.
The garbage bags and crow's home at the same striations and offset overlaps as the bag with Jessica's body.
This meant that crow owned one of the seventeen boxes of bags at the back from the crime scene could have come from.
Finally Dr Harry holiness compared a sample of crow's voice to the voice on the anonymous telephone call.
When it came to a conclusion somewhere in the ninety percent range range that this was in fact the same voice.
Based on the forensic evidence prosecutors believe that Crowe used his dog to start a conversation with Jessica while she waited outside for her father do I thought.
From there he coaxed her into his car with the promise of the fast food hamburger.
Afterwards the forensic evidence suggests crow took her back to his apartment where she picked up the apartment carpet fibers and the hairs from his dog.
For reasons unknown pro apparently suffocated Jessica in his apartment.
He then hit the body in a garbage bag and placed it in the back of this car without creating suspicion.
After dumping the body in the deserted location he placed a call to police probably out of guilt which doctor hole lead matched with his audio expertise.
James crow maintained his innocence and his defense attorneys challenged the forensic evidence.
In a separate hearing to determine the admissibility of this forensic evidence in the upcoming trial prosecutors had to prove that the scientific analysis of the garbage bags Matt general scientific standards in the end the judge said I find it admissible not only do I find admissible I think it's some of the best forensic testimony that I've ever seen and the jury is going to be very very interested in this test.
Well you don't get those kind of compliments from judges every day.
Faced with the overwhelming forensic evidence James Crowe decided to plead no contest to second degree murder in exchange for a sentence of forty years in prison with no chance for parole.
In so doing pro avoided a possible death sentence.
All I can say is the man upstairs is waiting for him.
The not family was spared the ordeal of a trial.
But in the court room they showed crow how much he hurt them when Kevin read a point he had written.
The Knox never before realized the complexity of forensic evidence and the full measure of its power.
With all the DNA testing that goes on and.
Just all the science scientific technology that's available today I think just helps everybody get closer to the truth of crimes it wasn't available Mike take twenty thirty years ago.
Pretty much cut to the core of what happened the forensic capabilities of our local department of law enforcement lab and the F. B. I. lamb are what made this case possible in in the sense of made it possible for us to prosecute it successfully if we had not had the capabilities of those labs I think James crow would still be on the street.
