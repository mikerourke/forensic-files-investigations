This man talking Joseph Marie in nineteen ninety eight a key Marino came forward and confessed to the rape and murder of a restaurant worker I did this awful crime and I was alone but this man research I had already confessed to that crime and was serving a life sentence pleaded guilty and confess.
One of them was a line to find out who and why scientists look once more at the forensic evidence.
Austin Texas the state's capital city.
Twenty year old Nancy DePriest lived here with her husband Todd and fifteen month old daughter Sylvia.
She was so very friendly and and very open to anyone he she she just she just loves people she's just like a people person.
Nancy was a waitress at a Pizza Hut restaurant.
On October twenty fourth nineteen eighty eight she arrived for work at seven AM.
Her job was to get the pizza dough ready for lunch before the rest of the employees arrived.
The manager of the restaurant called several times that morning to make sure everything was alright there was no answer.
When he stopped by the restaurant around nine thirty he found Nancy slumped under the bathroom sink new and barely alive she had been shot in the back of the head.
Nancy was rushed to the nearest hospital.
My son in law said mom there's there's been a robbery.
They shot Nancy.
As the Todd how how bad is she hurt he broke down and he said mom she's on life support.
Nancy died later that day without regaining consciousness.
I began to scream I was I was totally hysterical.
The murder occurred before the restaurant opened so there were no witnesses to the crime.
The Austin police department found no signs of forced entry at the restaurant.
The motive appeared to be a robbery since money was missing from the safe.
On the floor of the bathroom police found a twenty two caliber shell casing from the murder weapon and Nancy's autopsy revealed she had been sexually assaulted.
Two weeks later investigators got their first break in the case.
Two employees from another Pizza Hut restaurant twenty two year old Chris show and nineteen year old Richard dancing went to the restaurant where Nancy had been murdered.
If it gets to me a funny kind of strange Nancy's code workers quickly informed authorities show and dancing were later questioned by police.
He started telling me about what I know about this murder and it's rape and I told him nothing went round and round for a couple hours I don't recall how many hours.
But he said at one point he said you know what.
We know you're not capable of this but we know you know if your mail you know something.
Detective Hector pulang call at the time a twelve year veteran of the force took over the interrogation.
Richard Dan singer and his girlfriend Donna and Stadtwerke also questioned they were absolutely horrible to me one time I had to plug go.
Hello to his fist on the table and I thought he was coming across to grab me I came about my cherry hit the wall behind it scared me so bad.
Donna said she and Richard were together in Donna's department at the time of the merger I took a lie detector test and they told me I flunked it.
Two days later.
I said show confessed to the rape and murder of Nancy DePriest.
Can describe he also revealed that his friend Richard Dan singer was his accomplice.
A choice said he and dancing entered the restaurant with keys the two had obtained.
They found Nancy alone preparing pizza.
After ordering her to remove the money from the safe choice said he and Dan singer bound gagged raped and shot her.
Chou said he was the one who pulled the trigger.
When the DNA results came back from the lab.
He'S had even more proof that it show and dancing were the killers.
Research showed not only confessed to the rape and murder of Nancy DePriest he became the state's star witness against his friend and co worker Richard dancing.
Nancy'S family was relieved that the case was concluded quickly not so much satisfaction I didn't I didn't feel that.
I guess relief.
That they were gonna be able to do it to someone else.
Also during the chill is confession was the DNA evidence a blood sample from Krista Chola matched the DNA from semen on the victim's vaginal swab.
Sam and a vaginal swab specimen from Nancy to priest DNA was extracted from spur Mattis on that swab and then DNA typing was done using a single gene that we had available at that point in time and the result was obtained from that gene that was actually compatible with Chris or Chola in about I tend to sixteen percent of the population.
Statistically there were three million other Texans who might have shared the same genetic marker but this wasn't the only forensic evidence.
A brown hair found in the restaurant bathroom was microscopically similar to dancing on ice.
Richard dancing pled not guilty and insisted he was innocent but the strength of a chosen confession and the forensic evidence were too great.
The jury deliberated just seven and a half minutes and found Richard dancing are guilty of aggravated sexual assault he was sentenced to life in prison.
In return for his testimony Chris a chose avoided the death penalty but he was sentenced to life in prison.
Life in prison was even harder for Richard dancing.
After three years behind bars.
Dan singer was assaulted by another inmate who mistook him for someone else.
Dancing or was kicked in the head with steel tip believes he survived but suffered permanent brain damage.
That'S just what happened to him is horrible he's gonna need care for rest of life.
But the story doesn't end there.
Eight years later.
Austin police received a letter from a key Marino who is serving three life sentences in another Texas prison for a string of robberies and sexual assaults Marino claimed that he was the one who raped and murdered Nancy DePriest.
Marino claimed he had undergone a spiritual awakening while incarcerated and wanted to set the record straight.
Marino said the el Paso police department have the gun he used to kill Nancy DePriest they had taken it when he was arrested on an assault charge.
Homicide detectives Manuel Fuentes was assigned to investigate Marino's story I got a call from el Paso police department and the detective there said you're not gonna believe this but again isn't hasn't been destroyed we still have it in an evidence scientists compared Marino's twenty two caliber handgun to the bullet removed from Nancy DePriest.
The ballistic examination did not reveal a match.
It appeared there wasn't much more to investigate.
Two years later a keen Marino tried once again.
I thank speaker Laney for your for this time he sent a letter to then governor George W. bush with the copy to the prosecutor's office.
I told them basically the same thing that I had.
That I committed a murder in eighty eight at the Pizza Hut.
And that there was two innocent men who I did not know locked up for it.
This time detective Fuentes visited Chris a chose in prison.
Once again but show a repeated what he had been saying for ten years that he and Dan singer had acted alone.
And he said as far as he knew that when the third person involved it was just him and Richard that kill mansion preach.
So there was little more authorities could do especially since a chill as DNA matched semen found at the crime scene.
It would take one more year before one of these men finally changed his story.
For almost eleven years Krista chill a continue to maintain that he and Richard dancing or were responsible for the rape and murder of Nancy DePriest.
One year after Ricky Marino wrote a letter to the governor's office saying he murdered Nancy DePriest Chris Chola changed his story did you kill ninety degrees no ma'am.
Didn'T look me in the face tell me did a show now claimed that his confession had been coerced he said he was physically assaulted threatened and denied access to an attorney during police questioning not female detective an Hispanic detect to come in and I asked her.
You know can I have an attorney.
She'S a role of service so you can have one to officially charged.
It search for help a chill a contacted the Wisconsin innocence project a group that investigates cases in which they believe an innocent person has been wrongfully convicted.
Hi Tom please help me.
I don't know who else to turn to.
You know I think one of my closing lines was that I told them I've lost faith in the system.
But I haven't lost faith in myself.
The founder of the innocence project John praised wasn't sure what to think we called up Chriss attorney to get his side of things and say sometimes the attorneys say I yeah I'm but I'm concerned about this case and he may be innocent unfortunately in this case we got the complete opposite the Christmas attorney told us and we are totally wasting our time on this case he's very guilty.
And if Chris a chill was innocent why did DNA tests place him at the scene of the crime twelve years earlier tests could only analyze one gene from Nancy decrease vaginal swab the gene called DQ alpha.
But by the year two thousand the accuracy of DNA testing had advanced to a level where ten genes could be analyzed.
The DNA testing that I'm doing today is more complicated harder to interpret.
The Wisconsin innocence project asked local prosecutors to send Nancy DePriest forensic samples from more sophisticated DNA testing which they did.
Twelve years after Nancy the priest's murder.
Karen Scalise compared Chris a chose blood DNA to the vaginal swab taken from the crime scene.
I started well my god NGS immediately double checked it to myself.
Just to make sure.
Tional DNA testing was also done by ed Blake who had performed the original DNA test a decade earlier when that work was done ultimately Chris art show are richer Dan singer and Nancy DePriest husband were all eliminated is the source of the spermatozoa from Nancy to priest.
But there was still the issue of Marino's gun detective flint has decided to send it to another lab the southwest institute in Dallas for more tests the shell casing without a doubt matched the gun that we got from a Camerino and this was a showcase that was found inside the Pizza Hut so now we had DNA and we had a bullet or a shell casing is ejected at the crime scene that matched the gun that we got from I came right now.
As a last step prosecutors compared to keen Marino's DNA to the semen from Nancy to priests vaginal swab it matched just as Marino said it would.
T. Marino's confession includes a chilling account of what happened the day Nancy DePriest was murdered but it also answered many questions I was wearing a workman's uniform with a false name on it.
And I knocked on the a side door.
You know help Nancy at gunpoint and demanded the restaurants money.
But after that but older adults going to head over to the the plumbing underneath the sink we were there.
She got underneath the sink a shot in the back of the head one time without twenty two.
But he made the mistake of leaving the shell casing behind.
Marino says Nancy reminded him of a female guard he knew from prison a woman he detested.
But I came out not only did I intend to kill a whole bunch of blacks and Mexicans but I told myself the first white when I ran across that look like on the blower brains out that's exactly what I did.
But the bigger question is why Chris a chose would repeatedly confessed to a crime he didn't commit.
You have to be a psychologist I'm not it's hard for me to conceive I this in fact when I first most metro chose attorneys for any Mister a damn good about our journeys when they first brought me back the first thing I asked was what in the world made Ocho a confess most people will come in time our numbers confessed that you know what don't tell me that sure incident at church but chose said he was threatened with the death penalty unless he confessed technique most law enforcement interrogation experts say is improper.
The law fortunately or unfortunately allows police officers to lie to individuals being interrogated but they can't say is if you don't confessed to me you're gonna get the death penalty if they knew that to be a lie or if you do confessed to me I'll make sure you don't you don't go to prison or you don't get charged on this crime so they can lie about the evidence and they can lie about other circumstances having to do with the interrogation but they can't tell lies that could be regarded as promises or threats.
I chose said his confession included details of the crime because police showed him pictures of the crime scene before his confession.
Off the top of my head I can't think of a circumstance in which it would be appropriate because it contaminates the suspect and it means that if they are innocent made the false confession you'll never know.
A chill also says he was threatened physically look me up and down SO you young.
Here you never been in jail you'll be fresh meat and when have you.
Experts say the way to prevent police induced false confessions is to videotape the entire interrogation.
If a suspect later alleges police misconduct in the interrogation room the video tape can be evaluated if Christmas confession had been videotaped from start to end there is no way this what happened first of all the police officers on down we would not have acted as they did it would have been a deterrent to their misconduct.
Currently only two states require all suspect interrogations to be videotaped Alaska and Minnesota.
The Austin police department changed its policy and now video tapes of the interrogations in all homicide cases.
After twelve years in prison on January sixteenth two thousand one.
Two months later.
Richard dancing or was released to the care of his family.
Because of the brain damage she sustained as a result of the prison fight.
Richard dancing or will require specialized care for the rest of his life.
Sometimes I think about Richard and he.
I feel very bad I mean.
Because I was I don't have the courage.
To face up.
The officers involved in Christian chose interrogation have all refused to comment.
I was a little kid they told me that.
Police officers were there to take care of me to protect you.
I lost my child I loved her so much I miss her every day still thirteen years I miss her every three day.
And Chris lost twelve years he's used his whole use.
Brain damaged from a beating he received in prison.
He'S still serving that life sentence he'll serve it out.
