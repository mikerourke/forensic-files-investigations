In nineteen ninety seven two years after a series of unsolved kidnappings and sexual assaults in California.
One of the victims suddenly recalled an important detail of the crime she never told police.
She left some forensic evidence in the assailants vehicles.
Evidence that left quite an impression.
Nestled at the base of the magnificent Sierra Nevada range the size of California received unwanted publicity in nineteen ninety five.
A serial rapist was stalking young women sometimes striking in broad daylight all of the descriptions of the assailants were similar but not identical.
This woman was the first victim whom we'll call Maria.
I was sixteen years old trying to keep up my grades do good in school.
On July fourteenth nineteen ninety five as Maria was about to walk into our apartment she stayed outside for a moment to smoke a cigarette just as she lit the match.
He wanted a gun at her ordered her to get into the vehicle told her if she did not he would kill her.
The man admitted to being high on methamphetamines.
He drove her to a deserted field assaulted her and let her go.
At the hospital a rape test kit did not recover any biological material suitable for DNA testing.
Maria described her attacker as a young white male with curly here about six feet tall his weapon was a semiautomatic pistols.
Never you just feel sad betrayed hurt angry.
You get mad.
We just got a lot of pain.
Maria said the assailant drove a blue or gray pickup truck.
Police found a tire impression near the crime scene.
Ten days later there was another man thirty three year old woman parked in the local shopping center was accosted by a young white male and a white Ford Bronco and a.
She challenged him verbally and the flat.
Two weeks later a college girl was stopped by a man in the blue Thunderbird asking for directions I'm looking for as well not a street you get any help I don't think so the girl was suspicious and ran away.
Would you mind getting in the car and just driving with show me and agreed to show him where to go.
To look at them he was a top guy we could imagine knowing the girls in the car because he looked relatively clean cat was relatively soft spoken I had nice vehicle.
Along the way he stopped behind a dairy barn saying you need to get some fresh air.
And lotus drug paraphernalia and pornographic material in the backseat.
Or not graffiti depicted degradation and violence towards women.
Now fearing for her safety she decided to run away when she opened the door with a gun to our head.
Eventually he allowed her to go and she ran over a mile and a half for help.
And described the assault as particularly demeaning.
This guy was particularly particular well the demeaning to the women that he was assaulting and that was consistent with all three of the cases.
At the crime scene police found shoe impressions possibly those of the essay.
The victims each described the attackers physical appearance different and if it was the same man.
Please question why he drove a different vehicle to each crime.
Detectives in the Saudi a California were investigating four separate incidents involving attempted kidnapping robbery and sexual assault.
In each case the perpetrator was described as a tall young white male carrying a semi automatic pistol.
He left little forensic evidence behind shoe impression that one crime scene and some tire impressions at the not.
But the vehicles were different and the victims gave different descriptions of the assailant raising questions about whether it was the same man.
There was a discrepancy and the hype which often occurs when you're attempting to describe an assailant who is just sexually assaulted and abused you at gun point on there was also some issues with regard to describing the suspect's hair his hair lake.
The first break in the case occurred when police in Fresno California about an hour's drive away arrested a man they suspected of committing similar crimes there.
We found out that a similarly describes suspect with a similar vehicle have attempted to separate a kidnapping that incident up in their city.
Later in the day actually the same day yeah our victim here in town was confronted.
To see if this was the same man assaulting women in Visalia police showed the victim Maria a photographic lineup that included the Fresno suspect.
But Maria could not identify any of the man.
I'M pretty sure we placed a four line up in front of R. one victim and she positively identified him now salida police were convinced they had their man there was a problem.
In their initial interviews with police both Maria and and described their attacker as having very little chance.
The Fresno suspect had a lot of chance take anti shoe size did not match the shoe impressions found at the crime scene.
Police out in the Fresno man was their perpetrators there's a suspicions were confirmed a few days later when the crimes in the Saudia started all over again.
A white male in a blue Thunderbird approached a fourteen year old girl and her six year old sister at an intersection and tried to coax them into his car when they refused he spat on.
A few hours later police saw a blue Thunderbird in the convenience store parking lot the driver match the description given by the two girls.
He was twenty year old Chad Melton Nancy.
The son of a prominent local dairy farmer he was married had no criminal record but police found methamphetamines in his car.
The M. all of his attacks and these women were indicative of someone who was using methamphetamine or crank pretty heavily he was very aggressive he was very demeaning and.
Just very brutal with the women it's and it's consistent in my experience with someone who's a chronic use of methamphetamine.
In a photographic lineup Maria positively identified Nancy Bogue as the man who assaulted her.
She was visibly shaken.
She began crying as I recall.
And was quite obviously quite upset I'm sure I brought back memories of that day she was a kid.
Maria said her assailant's vehicle is a pickup truck not a sedan.
Police found no evidence man CBOE had ever owned a pickup truck I also had my agency check for vehicles that were had been stolen in the last month matching that description as well and everything came back negative I couldn't get a lead on anything.
He'S found a pair of tennis shoes.
When forensic analysts compared man CBOE shoes the footwear impressions found at one of the crime scenes the results were inconclusive.
I am also identified Nancy does her assailant from a photographic lineup but she had identified another man just a few weeks earlier sure.
Because of these inconsistencies prosecutors wanted more than just eyewitness identification they were hoping for scientific at.
On the strength of the eyewitness identification.
Twenty year old Chad Nancy but was arrested for the kidnapping and sexual assault and and Maria what was so horrific about the case was that it involved such horrendous acts of violence.
He was completely self absorbed he was in a lot of trouble he just couldn't understand why mom and dad couldn't bail him out of this and he repeatedly asked for mom and dad to be able to come down and take him home and he thought he was he just thought they could get a marvelous.
The problem facing prosecutors was that one of the victims had previously identified someone else.
Our memories are actually.
Not accurate at all and victims at the time of the crime most victims are victims.
At nighttime when it's dark out so you already have a visual disadvantage we also know that your eye sight actually diminishes in when you're in a panic situation when you're afraid.
And so when the victim says that's the man in their unequivocal that did this to me they're probably wrong.
With no forensic evidence prosecutors knew Nancy bills defense attorney would challenge the victim's identification.
As Nancy ball await trial investigators interviewed his wife despite the circumstances she tried to be helpful.
She was pregnant with their first child at that time.
And she knew that he had a had been abusing methamphetamine she knew that he had some bizarre sexual appetites that became worse when he was using methamphetamine.
but I don't think she suspected he was involved in these things hi.
The man seen those homes located on his parent's dairy farm which had a number of different vehicles.
A search of the California motor vehicles database confirmed the Chad Nancy Bowe did not own a blue or silver pickup truck that Maria described by.
His father one day and recently sold.
Police located the vehicle sixty miles away.
This is the police videotape of Maria examining that vehicle.
She said it was similar to the one she remembered but wasn't sure it was the same one.
A new owner had made a number of repairs and improve.
Maria remembered an important detail she had completely forgotten.
I remember I.
It was at that point that she recalled while she was being sexually assaulted outside the driver's side door as the defendant had her bent over she bit down on the weather stripping I wanted to leave something behind some type of evidence teeth marks scratch marks something.
I scratched the inside of the truck.
And I bit down on.
To police the marks on the black weather stripping appeared to be just wear and tear but Maria insisted it was evidence.
The two foot piece of black rubber was carefully removed from the driver's side window and sent to a forensic odontology just doctor Norman spur.
During his forty year career Dr Sperber has examined by impressions in a number of items found at crime scenes.
I'Ve seen them in apples I've seen them in cheese I've seen it in sandwiches and never before however on weather stripping I'd never seen that before.
Although it had been nearly two years since those bite marks were made the elasticity of the rubber retain the imprints in their original form.
All of a sudden I can see for small rectangles which I knew represent the lower front teeth.
Dr Sperber marked the indentations with small dot next Maria's death were set in a help how genetic material to make a model of.
When Dr Sperber compared Maria's dental impressions to the bite marks in the weather stripping he discovered.
On the weather stripping I noticed that one of the teeth was sticking out the right front to.
The victim's teeth I noticed the same truth that right front to the sticking out every tooth just fit precisely I'd never really seen a match quite so good on inanimate object before.
Despite the fact that two years had passed despite the alterations to the car made by the new owner.
East could now prove Maria had been inside that vehicle.
It was not a crime about sex it had to deal with violence the defendants hatred for women the things that he's said to both of these girls during the commission of the sexual assault.
When police searched Chad Nancy Bose home they discovered even more incriminating evidence.
They found the pornographic video tapes and reported seeing a man see both car and police also found ammunition for three eighty gate semi automatic pistol.
When Jack man CBOE went on trial for the kidnapping and sexual assault of both Maria and Dan prosecutors portrayed him as extremely dangerous a man without guilt or conscience.
Even care who he had to be hurt to to get what he wanted like I say he's a hedonistic self absorbed little brat.
As expected the defense challenged hands identification of Nancy both since she had initially identified another man.
Although there was very little forensic evidence what they had was overwhelming.
Maria'S bite marks proved she had been inside the truck owned by the men see both.
A vehicle the Chad.
After explaining my conclusions under direct examination by the prosecutor I remember being very surprised that there was very little questions and very little time spent by the defense in cross examination of on me and I assumed of because the evidence is so dynamic.
The sixteen year old biting down on the weather stripping was what you would call the smoking gun in the case essentially it prevented the defense from arguing that they had the wrong guy in that particular case and the fact that she at the time was being sexually assaulted.
Thought enough to bite down on the black rubber weather stripping and scratch the door area up.
Is amazing it's incredible that someone would think to do that.
The jury found Chad Nancy Bogue guilty of two counts of kidnapping rape and sexual assault he was sentenced to one hundred fifty five years in prison and won't be eligible for parole until he serves one hundred thirty three.
It was a huge sense of relief that this sexual predator will never walk the streets again he will never be able to do this to anyone else he's a brutal user.
If I'm convinced and given the opportunity he would use again he would use people begin to get what he wants for his immediate pleasure I wouldn't want my daughters around my wouldn't want your daughters found them and I don't think any any caring parent would.
Chad Nancy those convictions has provided closure for Maria was since moved to San Antonio Texas to build a new life.
Without her bike impressions in the rubber on that pickup truck prosecutors might not have been able to make their case.
The message that should be sent is if this doesn't ever happen to someone else.
And they are being sexually assaulted leave behind a piece of evidence because that forensic evidence can absolutely be a crucial.
Piece of evidence in the case I didn't want anybody going through what I went through by him.
And now I'm.
I had a fight with myself because I know that will never happen to anybody else by hand.
