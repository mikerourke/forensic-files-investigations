In nineteen eighty one.
Police found partial print near a door knob at a crime scene.
The suspect police had no way to compare the printer to the one million prints on file.
Seventeen years later new forensic technology change that breathing new life into what was a very old.
Whittlesey was one of this country's outstanding architects in the early nineteen.
Was the first to design.
He designed and built all the train station is clear across the United States Albuquerque is one of his most famous and the next most famous I would guess would be Ultramar at the rim of the Grand Canyon which he built in nineteen oh two.
But his oldest daughter Jeanette identified with their fathers.
And creativity more than the others.
Shonda family pressure to attend college and instead headed to the hotels at age seventeen she began her career as a merry and Morgan dance she was also a singer performing with the San Francisco Opera never married but she loved children she grew older she eventually found work as a governess but by the nineteen fifties she retired and moved into a family home on Cimarron street in Los Angeles.
She never owned a car it was a fixture in the neighborhood riding on a bicycle stopping to talk and sometimes play with the neighborhood children.
She would relate to them a lot more so than she would to adults.
She had kind of almost a childlike quality about her the neighbors all color the bicycle lady.
And everybody spoke highly of her she was pleasant she would talk to people.
Even into your eighties she still rode a bicycle through the neighborhood.
But as she grew older.
She was quite concerned about intruders breaking into her house to the point where she had built kind of jury rigged to alarm system out of wires and threats from Kansas to the larger if anybody tried to come in a window or a door.
On March thirteenth nineteen eighty one.
One of the neighbors noticed in its front door was open.
Inside the doorway.
Paramedics found eighty six year old little C. in our upstairs bedroom.
Dead from multiple stab wounds Frank Bolden was the first detective on the scene.
The just the way that I completed she offered much resistance there was no need for injury Willis objected to.
The bedroom was ransacked the motive appeared to be robbery.
Several doors were open a lot of the items were pulled out there was blood on various items in and out of drawers.
And also noticed blood drops leading down the left hand side of the stairs person leaning clean blood drops was in fact leaving the area of the body going downstairs and going through the front door at the front door was a blood smear and print leading to the door knob of the door investigators hope that the fingerprints and the blood drops would lead to the killer.
The entire neighborhood including the children were shocked and saddened by the merger of the eighty six year old in it will say despite her cheerful disposition her friends Neil he was particularly fearful of crime.
Whether it be a premonition.
Whether just a coincidence but there is something that that the trouble her a lot.
She'D always lived a very kind life that had never bothered anybody this was just not fair that someone so dear and sweet.
I would have to end her days this way it was just was not fair to be mutilated like she was.
Inside the home with a well the forensic evidence which told the story of what happened during its last moments alive.
We believe that the person had come up on the front porch open a window on the front porch called in the open window sept on the test the PLO I left a footprint.
A night service at some point we worked our way upstairs where she was in the bedroom was it's always very sad the most clearly cut.
Instead of in different parts of your body.
And at some point the suspect was also injured.
Find common when night is used that the attacker slides because the blood is slippery they'll slide over the blade and cut themselves.
It appears the suspect walked back down the stairs leading from his left hand the forensic evidence revealed that the killer left through the front door and stole.
Bicycle from the front porch to make kids get away.
Michelle Kessler was assigned to collect the blood drops from the home she started with the grand piano.
Because it was dry and flaky I used a clean disposable scalpel and just collected into a.
Kessler used a different technique on the blood stains on the front door well in those days where is the class squares dampened with water and disposable tweezers are clean the tweezers and between the alcohol.
A fourth print was discovered on an arch way leading to the front door.
They thought it might be a partial.
It'S when you take a flashlight and shine it on an angle on an oblique angle kind of like at home when you can't see handprints on your furniture but you turn on the light you're looking it's best.
The forensic evidence told police hold the crime was committed.
The evidence couldn't identify.
This was nineteen eighty one.
Eight years before DNA was first used in the criminal case.
Police could find no witnesses to the crime none of the neighbors had seen anything suspicious.
Detectives and look to other areas for leads I was conversing with other detectors and we were comparing notes we were comparing French.
But as far as a specific suspect we had.
During the fingerprints in Enid Whittle sees home two others arrested for similar crimes in the area wasn't difficult.
Comparing them to everyone in the files was impossible.
It would have to search just over million cards if there was a known suspect we can easily pull the card into the comparison but without a known suspect it would be very difficult without a full pattern type.
And without a fingerprint match.
Investigators knew was that the killer had type B. blood was left handed.
It would take another sixteen years before a new technology gate police.
They usually have put a lot of time and effort into it.
Little Caesar's murder case was one of several unsolved cases that languished in Frank Bolens cold case files I remember him telling me that during his thirty year career there was a handful of cases maybe three cases that haunted him that he wanted to solve before he retired and this was one of.
We have the killer's blood from the crime scene and some of his fingerprints little else.
In the years since in its murder in nineteen eighty one there had been more technological advances in forensic science than in any other time in history.
In this age of personal computers it's hard to remember that in the nineteen eighties very few people had even seen a computer let alone used one.
Large expensive mainframe computers were the standard.
The night to the future the FBI and the Lockheed Martin company experimented with using computers to analyze and compare fingerprints.
When you scanners were developed to capture the prince and the files can be compressed and formatted.
The FIS was born.
This is actually an acronym for automated fingerprint identification system and it's a computer system and what it does is photographed a latent prints scans and then it'll give us a candidate list usually if ten people who have similar characteristics to the one that we entered into the system.
This new technology revolutionized fingerprint analysis not only for new cases worldwide.
A FIS non no match for the three prints taken from the window but the a FIS had better luck with the partial palm print.
It was such a small area that you weren't sure if it was actually from a fingerprint or that was from a palm area I think in this case the AFI S. determined that the print was a partial fingerprint and not a palm print.
And the computer identified ten individuals who sprints needed to be examined.
I wasn't able to pull the cards of those candidates and do a comparison and we do a side by side comparison using a special magnifying glass.
Those include within a half mile of the victim he had a late the record within the division having been arrested several times for theft and things of that nature.
Stewart was sitting in a Los Angeles jail following an arrest on domestic abuse charges.
Didn'T really care for elderly people.
He said that he had been a burger.
He also told police that stored seniors in Beverly hills Culver city and Wilshire near his home.
He said one more thing that Stewart was left handed.
On December twenty sixth nineteen ninety six detective Boland and two others interview Carl Stewart.
First call Stewart claimed he knew nothing about the robbery or we'll see then he changed his story.
As my partner and I would release.
Some information on bits and pieces of evidence.
He would rethink his statement and make it work around the evidence that was obtained and how it got there.
When told his fingerprint was near teenage door storage said he had once been inside her home briefly but had nothing to do with her murder.
District attorney Hayden's Sacchi would make the decision on whether to take this case to trial.
It happened on March eleventh of nineteen eighty one when I was still in high school and I thought to myself boy this is an old case.
You know have a restocking of witnesses available for instance do we preserve all the evidence properly.
All of the evidence had been in the police property room for the sixteen years since the murder but one important piece was not.
Take another forensic breakthrough not available in nineteen eighty one to solve that problem and bring Carl stork to justice.
Investigators wanted to make sure that it was Carl Stewart's blood inside in a little sis home.
To do that scientists needed a sample of Stewart's blood as well as Enid whittles.
Just watch it in its blood taken after autopsy was missing from the evidence file.
Small dried samples of that John the top placed in sterile water.
Dissolves the stain and it also causes any cells that are present for example white blood cells which contain DNA supplies they break open spilling their contents including the DNA out into the water.
The next step was to clean the DNA I had to pass through something called a centric onto the space we have filtered and what it does is it accomplishes two things it cleans the DNA and it also concentrates a smaller volume of of water.
The DNA is then replicated in multiple times into a workable sample through Apollinaris chain reaction or PCR.
Six genetic markers were typed and illuminated by a blue collar attached in the PCR process.
I had one stain that actually matched the genetic profile B. and we'll see on the remaining items I believe there were eight other bloodstains from throughout the residence that matched Karl Storz genetic profile.
May seventeenth nineteen ninety nine Zaki presented the forensic evidence of the unit would also use murder to a jury.
The motive was robbery.
Shares in it confronted Stewart a fight ensued causing the defensive wounds to arms and hands.
During the encounter cut his left hand which left a trail of blood down the left hand side of the steps.
The work left his partial print near the front door as he left the scene.
Print originally thought to be a palm print but later identified as a partial fingerprint by the automated fingerprint identification system.
When we got our man.
So that's how we knew we had our man.
The jury just two hours.
Hi Carl Stewart guilty of first degree murder.
He was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole.
This was the first homicide investigation assigned to Frankel.
Despite taking seventeen years he refused to give up.
He will give a hundred ten percent every investigation if you participate.
Sometimes he's a little bit of a pain but you know it's all for a good cause and hello I enjoy working with.
I can't say it's a happy thing.
I did take the person off the street that was responsible for her in this vicious crime and I would say that the world elderly people females who ever in general is a little bit safer today because this person is behind bars how many disappointments so many cases gone unsolved that you couldn't do you can do anything with a little long comes new technology.
I think it is so wonderful to think that after all these years that they would go back when they got better equipment and new technological things and try to solve these unsolved crimes and put these people where they belong think of tomorrow.
