A young woman stopped her car along a busy highway in California she was never seen again.
For three years the search for her whereabouts continued but the trail of actually turned cold so cold that forensic scientists needed new techniques to solve.
Twenty three year old Denise Huber lived with their parents in Newport beach California.
An upscale suburb outside of Los Angeles.
She just graduated from college and.
I think she just wanted to have fun and before she settled down into a job.
He'S worked as a waitress and a part time sales assistant at Bloomingdale's.
Five foot nine the striking blue eyed brunette had no trouble attracting dates the most recent boyfriend was Steve Kerr X..
On Sunday night June second nineteen ninety one Stephen Denise plan to see the Marcy rock band perform in Inglewood.
At the last minute Steve couldn't get off from work.
Disappointed but undeterred Denise asked a casual friend Robert Calvert to go with her.
He said I'll be home late and I remember saying well don't be too late you know because I was wearing when you're not home on time.
After the concert Denise and rob stopped at the el Paso cantina for a drink.
Where Denise met an old acquaintance whom we'll call rocks.
Ross had had a romantic feelings for her.
In the past he did ask her to go with him that night.
Want to go home with them which she did not do anything wrong left the restaurant around one o'clock in the morning and Denise drop rob off at his home.
Rob was the last known person to see Denise Huber.
Well I think in the morning when she was in there obviously there was some concern but we didn't keep that close tabs on or is there hope and she was twenty three years old and.
Brandon'S car was found along the Costa mesa freeway three miles from home with a flat tire.
Then look like anything that occurred at the vehicle was parked between two call boxes that were never used that night.
In my mind I just knew something horrible had happened because this wasn't the kind of person that would just disappear without telling at the Costa mesa police dispatched investigators to the scene.
This side of the car itself appeared to be clean there was no blood there there didn't appear to be windows broken they didn't appear to be any damage to the car per person shoes were gone actually gotten out of her car and left the flashers were on on the car like she the card broken down she was gonna get out and go walk for health.
Search dogs picked up the scent on the side of the freeway but soon lost it.
No one had seen her.
It appeared in the Super had simply back.
It'S worse than that I think I was afraid of.
For my own death.
Search helicopters and all other means to look for twenty three year old in the super after her abandoned car was found along a busy highway.
You could hear from our house and you know what they're looking for new.
If they don't find what they're looking for this is kind of the obvious would kind of be a body that to look.
And it's horrible it's the most horrible feeling you could ever have.
Like I couldn't breathe for I don't know how long.
Analysis of the plant tire revealed it had not been tampered with.
While the physical evidence led no where.
Police interviewed the last known person to see Denise per day from the night before Robert Calvert.
Could have been attached to it with her and have been upset because.
There is no.
The manager contact between the two of them.
Police also looked into Denise's relationship with Steve Horrocks the boyfriend who was supposed to accompany Denise to the concert but backed out at the last minute.
State parks was again cooperative information data from him he was always willing to give the police also tracked down Ross.
Ross was able to put himself in the alibi situation until the he did not go follow her after.
She dropped a roblox I never gave up hope that should be found alive we did everything from thinking that she might have had a boyfriend at the folks didn't know about and maybe let the state of the city eloped.
Reporter lead investigators and Denise's family turned to the media.
All I do is get a picture in front of people get the story out and the news media they were wonderful because every time we have anything going on they would be there and they'd show up so the community really it was like it was their daughter.
Media attention produced hundreds of tips most were well intentioned some were not.
Three hundred and fifty miles away in Prescott Arizona a man living in a well to do neighborhood called local police to report something suspicious in his neighbor's driveway.
It was a Ryder truck with California license plates.
It had an extension cord coming out of the back of the truck.
The neighbor said it was plugged into an electrical socket on the side of the house.
Whatever was inside the truck was running twenty four hours a day.
A search of the truck revealed it had been stolen in California.
Inside was an industrial sized freezer in the cargo area.
And inside the freezer was a large black garbage bag on and and they felt it and believed what they felt was a was an arm of a of a person but I recall seeing two arms coming back with the hands handcuffed and a ring I remember seeing jewelry and I was I was really shocked.
For the medical examiner it would be the most difficult case she had ever encountered.
The past year a stolen Ryder truck.
Taining a freezer with the human body inside had been parked at the home of thirty nine year old John Pamela a handy man and painter.
Mr fennel are was very calm he was very polite and he just really didn't have much to say about it but he seemed kind indifferent to the whole thing.
Contents of the freezer were sent to the Maricopa county coroner's office.
Dr and buckles handled the case.
Obviously it's a homicide or at least a hidden body for some reason and because of its clandestine nature you're like okay so we got an evidentiary thing here let's think homicide but think the worst I said yes that the female she also had some female jury evidence and long fingernails the handcuffs were evident and we didn't see much in the way of closing she appeared to be naked.
Following the body would cause rapid decomposition so doctor buckled needed to collect evidence quickly or lose it forever.
Hi tech clean scalpel handle and actually scrapes on the watery fluid into jars and held it that way I thought well at least we can collect the specimens it was a sheer lack that we even got any sperm at all and a woman who is frozen the three years.
Dr buckles removed the handcuffs and defrosted the hands slowly.
When they're frozen the skin it's fairly symmetrical and intact until she starts losing the fluid and then the skin will start traveling even in the finger tips in fact that's where it starts one of the first.
We got all the prints that first day they're actually rolled onto a fingerprint card just as if they were a person who's being arrested at the same process on a dead person.
When they entered the prints into their computer database of missing persons they immediately found a match.
It was Denise Huber who had been missing for three years.
They were able to do the fingerprints and that's something I never even thought of I'm mad I never imagined that we would have that kind of evidence after three years.
Meanwhile John tomorrow refused to explain why Denise's body was in his freezer three hundred fifty miles away from where she disappeared.
Two police search tomorrow's and the home of his mother who lives next door.
She was quite taken back that we had also secured what we found to be her home she knew nothing about John having girlfriends or who it might be and basically sat up a lawn chair across the street and just sat there and watched us for.
Police found the box marked Christmas on a shelf and Pamela rose garage.
Inside was Denise's bloody clothing.
Driver'S license and her high heeled shoes.
And police found credit card receipts that showed them all our had bought the freezer just days after Denise's disappearance.
They also discovered blood stained clothing belonging to John Pamela.
They didn't know whose blood it was they didn't know if it was the nieces some other persons a mixture Mr final ROZ.
So they needed a sample of Denise's blood we didn't have blood.
We ended up sending them some bone marrow the DNA extracted from Denise hubris bone marrow match the DNA in the blood on tomorrow's family arose basement.
Police found a police officer's uniform.
And the dungeon.
I think that all showed me he was just that type of person not the mild mannered person he was when I spoke to him he had that very dark violence other side.
And that was becoming more and more apparent as as the case progressed on.
One of his girlfriends we talked to said that you know he had some weird sexual fantasies one of the girls have been handcuffed.
And left exposed and naked in hand cuffs left exposed to an open window the evidence implicated Pamela R. O. in the disappearance and death of Denise Huber but it did not explain.
We took off two or three black plastic bags that had encased the whole body and inside that were some smaller white plastic bags which covered the head.
And when we remove that and we started defrosting your we actually found a.
Gag type device over her face and over her mouth area at with a piece of duct tape that had been taped over her upper mouth nose area.
Dr buckles discovered that Denise's skull had been severely damaged.
Dr Laura full genetic a forensic anthropologist was asked to reconstruct the skull for further analysis.
Look for parts that go together naturally I need to start with the malt or the top brown part of the head and then you proceed towards the face and the reason I do it that way is because the face typically has the smallest most complicated pieces and you want to have your framework built so that when you get to the face of something to put the face back onto the forensic analysis would reveal not only how Denise Huber died.
After a three year search Denise your first body was found in a freezer in Arizona.
Rancic investigators reconstructed her skull in an effort to understand how she died.
Patterned injuries of two different varieties indicating two different weapons were used and you can also see little pieces of plastic that are caught in those fractures that told us that the bags were in place when she received the blows to the head.
Thirty one times.
It'S horrifying and if I stop too long to think about what how she felt when she was by the freeway I'm paralyzed and I can't do my job.
I don't I don't think about that until it's all over and done with for me it's a matter of here's the puzzle my job is to put the puzzle together and interpret the puzzle and then I can go home and cry in the shower.
The semen found underneath his clothing matched John Pamela rose DNA profile she was innocent and innocent victims.
And it could have been anybody sister continue keeping your sister your friend and and that's scary it really hurt you emotionally at that point when you realize that.
I'Ll be honest I won't drive on the interstate.
And and allow anyone to help me.
Because of this.
Police also discovered that John Pamela was working in Newport beach California at the time Denise disappeared.
He had rented the front portion of this warehouse for his painting business they talk to people who rented the unit after he had moved out of band and that's about what the unit what condition unit was in and the point is to is there in the corner where they found a large brown stain that washed out with the hose with dried blood is very sharp on water it can be washed away.
Initial tests revealed nothing.
Investigators decided to wait until dark and use luminal which caresses or close when it comes into contact with the iron component in.
Found in the warehouse matched the indentations in Denise's based on the forensic evidence prosecutors believe that when Denise's tire went flat panel are stopped and offered to help.
At some point he overpowered her and took her to his warehouse a few miles away.
The store the body in a freezer he bought a few days after he killed Denise.
Two years later he stole the Ryder truck and took the freezer with Denise's body in it with him when he moved to Arizona.
He kept the truck in his driveway with the freezer running constantly.
The second highest since then since then John has.
And violence to other people and it's it's escalated up to the point of murder but I don't think Denise has been the only one.
On June twentieth nineteen ninety seven six years after Denise disappeared John tomorrow was tried and convicted of first degree murder.
He was sentenced to death.
Four and six were was challenged every step of the way here in court even before court I think lot of it went to the state Supreme Court.
But every challenge was beat back because of great forensics and great police work I wanted to know the truth and some of those horrible.
But I'd rather have the answers then just be wondering in my mind because sometimes you imagine things.
As bad or worse than what they were.
This really is the way it's supposed to be done and then it makes you work harder on the next one and when you're about to throw your hands up in despair you think to the super heated that case you got it reconstructed keypad there is an answer.
