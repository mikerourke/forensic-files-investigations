Are in the midst of a promising dance career Tracy Joe shine suddenly dropped out of school and shortly afterward disappeared.
Twelve years later debris from an old refrigerator would warm up what had become a very cold case.
Tracy Joe shine grew up in Houston Texas.
She was a good student a girl scout and played sports.
Real interest her passion.
At the age of thirteen she auditioned and was accepted to the prestigious high school for performing arts in Houston it was a dream come true.
And while away at school Tracy Joe began to experiment with drugs that's when you start having the problem started being around people started getting involved in and taking drugs and and I did that time just really didn't understand it or didn't want to do.
She started skipping classes for grades began to slip and she became romantically involved with thirty one year old Michael Neil would recently been released from prison.
The first time I met him and she brought him over to my apartment the same to be applied enough and soon to be nice enough eventually Tracy Jo abandoned her dreams of a career in dance dropped out of school and at the age of eighteen moved in with her boyfriend Michael and his mother.
Tracy Joe's mother didn't know what to do next.
Tracy was not the Tracy that she was before she did the drugs Tracy had become someone else it was controlled by drugs and I just kept praying that you know she just lived through this and get out of all of it and then we can have our lives together again and and go on.
Michael Neil had recently been implicated in a racially motivated drive by shooting.
Detective Marcel Dionne went to Neil's home to question him.
Neil wasn't home but Tracy Jo waters.
Tracy had just taken a shot the.
So he arrested Tracy Joe for using drugs.
She'S been arrested two other times I believe for the third drug problem she said she tried to stop I had attempted to see if there was some way that I can get Tracy.
Your drug program.
And I was fine and that there was a waiting list at different places and there really wasn't a whole lot I could do said she wasn't a child anymore.
Police headquarters Tracy Joe offered to make a deal.
She said her boyfriend Michael was the one who committed the drive by shooting and she agreed to testify against him in return for a lighter sentence for her drug charge.
Early the next morning Michael Neil walked into police headquarters and put up the bail for Tracy John.
She was never seen again.
Now we had seen or heard from so at that point is you start calling her friends and start calling anybody that she'd been associated with well nobody had seen her nobody had heard from.
Marcel Dionne discovered that Michael Neil was a member of the Aryan brotherhood of violent white supremacist group.
This explains Niels alleged involvement in the drive by shooting which occurred in a black neighborhood.
When Dion asks Michael Neil about Tracy Joe's whereabouts he said the Tracy Joe left home shortly after her arrest and that he hadn't seen her since.
The day after Tracy Joe shine was released from prison on drug charges she visited her mother to borrow some money.
Although Tracy Joe had always stayed in touch with her mother and brother that this it was the last time her family saw her.
Tracy Joe had simply dropped out of sight.
What'S the matter I for some reason just felt something was wrong.
Virginia contacted Tracy Jo's boyfriend Michael Neil.
I called up there to find out about Tracy because I hadn't heard from in a couple weeks to see what was happening.
And they told me she wasn't there anymore.
When Michael Neal wasn't forthcoming Virginia had no other choice but to file a missing persons report.
Detected Marcel Dionne immediately suspected foul play.
Then a few weeks later Dion received an anonymous telephone calls yes I'd like to report a murder that she was telling me about this girl that was.
Apparently killed by a boyfriend stuffed in a refrigerator and taken out to a a car lot.
The informant eventually revealed the identity of the dead girl.
It was Tracy Joe shine.
The informant also said that the refrigerator used to store Tracy Jones body was still at the used car lot owned by Michael Neal and his brother Robert.
Armed with a search warrant detectives went to the car a lot on the refrigerator but discovered it had recently been cleaned with bleach.
Without a refrigerator part we collected a piece of human tissue from the Fraser unit and I had some hair follicles on forensic scientist attempted an RFLP DNA enzyme analysis on that issue but were unsuccessful.
The hair was compared visually to hair taken from Tracy Jones hairbrush.
But that comparison was inconclusive.
With no other leads detective Dionne spent the next few months looking all over Houston anywhere he suspected a body might have been buried.
I took a lot of hate everybody thought I was crazy because I was digging up half a Harris County I was drained ponds we used horses we used four wheelers I was given the nickname of digger because half the time I received a phone call I was big in someone.
But none of the leads were fruitful I knew that she had to be out there somewhere I just wouldn't give up.
Dionne also questioned Michael Neal's mother Barbara at her consignment shop there.
The young noticed something suspicious.
In the display case was some women's jewelry which was identical to jewelry owned by Tracy Joe shine.
I just couldn't believe the way the.
They had taken Tracy Joe's jewelry and placed it in a in a glass case at the business they were running and selling it over the counter.
Barbara McAllister told police that after Tracy Joe moved out of her home she simply took the jewelry Tracy Joe left behind and was trying to sell.
Although it may have been in poor taste it still didn't prove foul play.
But with nowhere else to turn the investigation faltered.
Dion had no choice but to attend to other cases.
I ordered all the evidence plus the refrigerator stored in our property.
And basically just about every year almost to the day they would call me and want to get rid of the refrigerator.
And I kept telling him no this is an open case I'm still working at.
Michael Neil was later arrested for another shooting incident and was convicted he was sentenced to life in prison.
His brother Robert Neal was arrested on a methamphetamine charge he too was convicted and sent to prison.
Despite their convictions the Neil brothers continued to insist they knew nothing about Tracy Joe's disappearance.
It would take another ten years before a cold case unit took a fresh look at the disappearance of Tracy Joe shine.
Nothing was heard from Tracy Joe shine for over a decade.
And police could find no solid evidence of what might have happened to.
During those years there's been no credit card activity no applications for drivers licenses no history of employment nothing.
Tracy Joe's ex boyfriend Michael Neal and his brother Robert were serving time in prison for crimes unrelated to her disappearance.
Then in nineteen ninety nine the Harris County sheriff's department formed a new cold case unit headed by detective Roger wedge worth and Harry for cars.
Tracy Joe shine case was one of the first across their desk.
Tracy is like a lot of young girls if you look at her her upbringing she was a girl scout very much loved by our mother just a normal kid who goes up goes to high school goes to proms and everything and she got mixed up in drugs and of course one of the worst mistakes of her life was meeting are suspect in this case Michael Neil.
As a first step.
They decided to retest tissue sample found in Michael o'neill's refrigerator with the new more sophisticated P. C. R. D. N. A. test.
But after more than twelve years.
The samples too badly degraded.
Then there was another setback the hair found with the tissue sample could not be located.
But for Charice and wedge worth were astonished to learn that the refrigerator was still in the sheriff's department property room.
In a long shot investigators decided to take a look at the refrigerator one more time.
We open it up and it looks fairly clean but we knew that it had been laid down on its back and we thought if if there was any kind of body fluids or any kind of evidence that may have drained into the wiring harness on the backside of it.
Branch six scientists swapped every square inch of the refrigerator and this time including the wiring and harness areas for any biological material that might be present.
There so many nooks and crannies in a in a refrigerator or any other machine like that to have body fluid things like that's gonna seep through there's just it would be impossible pride to clean it all.
The swabs were sent to the forensic lab I was skeptical that we would find anything of any value in the refrigerator simply because of the amount of time that it had been stored and the fact that like so many other evidence storage areas the environment was not ideal for preserving the evidence.
When Watson look closer at the swabs.
He discovered what appeared to be a piece of human skin.
Watson tested that skin sample using a PCR DNA test.
PCR testing essentially takes minute traces of DNA then amplifies or makes enough copies of it so that it can be analyzed.
The analysis was long and arduous and unfortunately was unsuccessful.
After months of frustration Watson heard about a new test the FBI laboratory had been experimenting with a test using mitochondrial DNA.
Traditional DNA testing uses DNA from the cell's nucleus mitochondrial DNA is taken from the mitochondria which exists outside the cell's nucleus.
It'S not as precise as traditional DNA testing but in some cases it's all scientists can get and this time Watson was successful.
The next step was to find a known sample of Tracy Jo shines DNA for comparison.
Bill Watson took letters written by Tracy Joe over a decade earlier to see if her DNA could be identified in the saliva from the envelope flaps.
But the DNA from the saliva was too badly degraded.
Mitochondrial DNA is passed from generation to generation maternally meaning the Tracy Jones mitochondrial DNA profiles would be identical to her mother's.
Even though we didn't have a sample from Tracy Jo to compare to the tissue that was inside the refrigerator we did have her mother and we were able to get a mitochondrial profile for mother when the mitochondrial DNA from the refrigerator was compared to Virginia shine it matched.
The biological material most likely was that of Tracy Joe shine.
Tracy Joe's DNA discovered on the handle of the refrigerator that might not have been unusual.
But skin found on the wiring on the backline this was a completely different matter.
Wonderful wonderful feeling it's.
You know you finally felt like all that hard work is finally coming together but even even whenever we got that we knew that this guy would never do the right thing and step up to the plate and tell the truth with this discovery Michael Neil was charged with murder.
His brother Robert hoping to gain an early release from prison for his drug conviction offered to make a deal.
After all these years and it's been prison I guess she finally realized he would never be getting out of prison unless he did something.
We know you have something to tell can we set down worked out a deal and he gave us his honest testimony which we felt mostly with honest testimony and told us what he knew about the K..
Robert not only revealed his brother's involvement in the murder he also implicated his mother his sister and himself.
Robert Neild told police that his brother Michael feared Tracy Joe shine would testify against him for the drive by shooting in exchange for a lighter sentence for her drug arrest.
So when Michael went to fail Tracy Joe out of jail he did so to eliminate a potential witness the most important thing that that Robert told us was he actually showed us how Michael Neal gilder in Robert made this motion like this like a choking motion so we knew that she'd been strangled.
Robert said Michael killed Tracy Joe in his bedroom and left her body there for three days.
The smell of decomposition prompted Michael's mother to look into the couple's bedroom where she saw the body.
She goes into the bedroom she sees that she's turning purple I mean that's a clue right there that something is not right.
Neil'S mother never reported Tracy Jones death to police.
After the body was removed Robert said his mother and sister clean the bedroom and burned incense to remove the odor.
Robert admitted helping Michael transport the refrigerator with the body inside to the used car lot the brothers owned.
Robert told us that he never saw the body they said his brother just tell him helping move the refrigerator basically don't ask me any questions.
And I won't tell you anything we'll just.
Move this refrigerator out of the car a lot he said I can assume that Tracy Joe shine was in there but I never saw or in there I never saw or in their.
Robert said he sat outside while Michael placed the body in a fifty five gallon drum.
Where Michael later took the barrel is unknown.
But Michael Neil didn't realize the tissue invisible to the naked eye would lead to his downfall over a dozen years later.
Michael made a lot of mistakes at the very beginning by leaving the body in there for several days by his mother finding out that Tracy was dead.
Instead the media at Lee disposing of the body it allowed us to get evidence out of the refrigerator the fact is science always progresses I always moves forward and as it has.
We'Ve been able to develop the type of testing that could let us test those smaller and smaller samples and match it up so his his biggest mistake was in thinking he'd get away with it.
Prosecutors had nobody Michael Neil was convicted of Tracy Jo shines murder and was sentenced to an additional forty five years in prison he won't be eligible for parole until two thousand seventeen when he'll be sixty years old.
do anything humanly possible to you would not change his impression anyway his brother Robert is still serving time for his earlier conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine.
Michael'S mother Barbara denied any knowledge of the murder saying she thought Tracy Joe had died of a drug overdose neither Barbara nor her daughter Jeannie were ever prosecuted for their alleged involvement in concealing evidence or abuse of a corpse since the statute of limitations for those crimes had expired.
Virginia shine says she will never stop looking for her daughter's grave even though Michael Neal stubbornly refuses to say where it is.
The sad part of it is is if he's just trying to just keep on being the one in control.
Is that he won't let us know where she really is.
So that I can have some kind of peace there is isn't it amazing it's not gonna be any worse for him to tell me.
Marcel Dionne's insistence on preserving the refrigerator for all those years provided the crucial forensic evidence necessary for a conviction.
I just couldn't believe it to me it was just a huge white off my back.
I've never been so happy over anything in my life.
The amount of effort that went into the sample processing on the front end was as much as you would put in any any case in a very difficult case and it was just.
I'M a scale of one to ten I would say it was an eight or nine.
