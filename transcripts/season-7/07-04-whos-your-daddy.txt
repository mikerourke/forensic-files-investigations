In nineteen eighty eight the body of a young woman was discovered in the Ohio River under.
Most of the evidence found at the crime scene here's fibers and fingerprints had been washed away.
But the victim six year old son on wittingly told investigators all they needed to know about the counter.
And he did it without saying a word.
I am we've neither walked down to pick up this trash in this room a troop of Boy Scouts headed to possum run creek one Saturday morning in January of nineteen eighty eight their mission was to pick up aluminum cans for recycling project.
Is that down there in the icy creek in rural Ohio they spotted what appeared to be a manic.
They have saw something just under the ice submerged.
It was the body of a young woman.
Local police took every possible precaution to preserve trace evidence by wrapping the victim's body in a sheet before taking it to the more.
A check of missing persons reports identified the woman as thirty two year old Margie coffee the single mother of two young children.
She had been reported missing ten days earlier.
Police had found a vehicle down off of Park Avenue east by a bar and she was a missing person by the time this body was located and the over by the weekend park.
The autopsy revealed that Margie coffee had been strangled with their own scarf.
The car under estimated she had been dumped in the creek ten days earlier the same day she disappeared.
Margie Ramey was her maiden name she was one of six children who grew up in the heartlands of Ohio on the outskirts of the town name Butler.
And she was an outgoing girl personal well she was a robust girl and she love life.
She worked on the farm and then she would help for mother on the farm they had a lot of cattle to take care of and she helped in that.
Margie grew up in a loving religious home but in her teenage years as most kids do she yearned for independence began spending most of her time in Mansfield a larger city about fifteen miles northwest of buckler she made friends with an unsavory crowd.
To get into some activities that were subject to prosecution by the law and they were mainly street crimes that type of thing that.
We were very low level but that's how we got to be acquainted with her during our work on the on the street.
Those street crimes allegedly included prostitution and illegal drug use.
Eventually Margie rejected that life she met a man named Steve coffee to married and had a daughter and she.
To support herself and her daughter Margie worked as a waitress she also enrolled in college to study law enforcement.
And during this time Margie had another child out of wedlock this time a son Brandon.
Police investigating her murder wondered if Marty had returned to the streets to support her children.
Well I know her family helped her son but she did make a lot of money and going to school no she didn't make a lot of money I work in a restaurant.
As police knew from experience life on the streets meant special dangers and a large pool of potential suspects.
Maybe there's somebody in the past that has a reason to want her dead.
Maybe she's done something or not paid something maybe some street person has come to this conclusion they are killer.
With no suspects or leads police hoped that the rushing water of possum run creek had not washed away evidence which could lead them to Margie's killer.
When thirty two year old Margie coffee was found strangled in a frozen creek police wondered if for past had finally caught up with her.
In her particular case and she had a background of some activity that was.
Certainly against the law we we looked into into that possibility man slipped back into that drug environment.
But friends said that wasn't the case Margie had been focusing her attention on her family and her education.
They were just adamant that they had not seen her she had been around and to their knowledge you completely cleaned up all over a past activities.
I believe she wanted to be a Christian lady a mall that I could gather from rich that's why she was striving for to do to be better to live better act better and forget all about anything in the past police learned that Margie had been actively dating since her divorce among the men she was seeing work to Mansfield police officers both of whom were married.
One was Robert lemon a veteran of the force.
He indicated to us that it had ended sometime before that.
Only a year and a half.
And that he had not had any contact with her and even spoken to any reason.
The other was lieutenant Charles close wall.
He said his relationship with Margie was over.
You tell us what was very much in love with his wife oftentimes spoke about what they did on weekends and things like that he was a type of police officer that other police officers I would say it would try to emulate.
Lieutenant Oswald furnished a police report indicating he had been on duty that night on a drug investigation.
The trail of Margie's killer was growing cold.
We had no fingerprints we had no weapon we had explored the other possibilities and those possibilities really we're going to come from her.
Margie coffee was last seen alive at this diner.
Sitting in a booth with their school books open studying for class.
Detective David mess more interviewed the owner of the diner who said that lieutenant Oswald was in the diner at the same time as Margie.
The two weren't sitting together but they did acknowledge one another.
It was a very distressing situation.
Not only did I work with them I.
No it was a good very good policemen but I've been friends with them.
And it was just.
Seven men think that he might have been involved in the crime like that.
When confronted with this information.
Margie'S parents laid their daughter to rest and excruciating task view parents are prepared for.
Marge'S parents Mister Mister Ramos suffered from that day all there was times that they would just break down and cry when they would see a picture of Margie are wet and.
when ms Remy would talk to me.
Little did police realize that Margie's own son would provide a tantalizing clue one that would lead them to the killer.
As a search for Margie copies killer continued on Mansfield police officer told homicide investigators about a suspicious incident that occurred the night Margie was killed.
The officer said he saw lieutenant Charles squall would been linked romantically to Margie on foot out of uniform and behaving strangely near the police station.
And he had a leather jacket on which would be unusual at that time that I do the fact he was working saucer said what's going on are you doing any kind of ignored it.
They continued on walking into the police department through the back way.
Both worlds behavior cast doubt on his claim that he was investigating a drug operation that night.
For him to be nervous and excited in that period of time it was kind of unusual that kind of took the luster or the punch out of his alibi in the forensics lab Margie coffees clothing which soon tell the story of its own.
Once the clothing is dried basically Lee Ellie hung on a hanger just like your clothing would be at home will be a piece of paper placed underneath in case anything naturally falls off and then the article simply held it's great for the spatula all the way down to help lift these articles off and let them fall into the paper to be collected.
While most of the trace evidence had been washed away by the water a very small amount remained.
Recovered a number of hairs and fibers in particular to fibers red in color the presence of these two fibers about a quarter of an inch in length and no more than twice the size of a human hair across for all we had to really work with.
While different fibers may look similar to the naked eye.
Under a microscope they are very distinctive.
From the side this trilobal shape gives the appearance of having a stripe running along the side.
Trilobal carpet is usually found in high traffic areas like hotels in automobile interiors since it hides dirt.
Tony Tim Basco took carpet samples from every location where Margie had been in the days before her murder.
Invesco thought he found what he was looking for in the home of Marty's parents.
Their margins parents house we found a floor map that actually had red carpet the red carpet fibers in the format look very similar to those that we have recovered from the victim.
Under a microscope that carpet was not similar to the fiber is on Marty's clothes.
Since lieutenant Oswald was seen in the diner with Margie on the night she disappeared ten bass still wanted to examine the police cruiser pulls what had been driving that night.
Most police vehicles are not carpeted because of heavy use and have rubber flooring and stand.
The police records revealed that on the night in question lieutenant Oswald was the watch commander and the watch commander's vehicle was different from the others.
Anything about that particular cruiser cruiser number three of six was it was a supervisor's car and wasn't your standard police car that you buy every year with the fleet it was bought at a public auction the Mansfield police had gone to an auction and purchased a Chevy caprice classic.
a full size car for their commanders and of course the operationalize police department a leisure vehicle than the than the guys in the street.
The carpet in the watch commander's car was red Tabasco took a small sample from the vehicle at first it looks similar to the carpet in Margie's parents house.
But under a microscope the fibrous told a different story and we're similar in all respects to the fibers found on marquees clothing.
We look to color you can see the colors the same look the diameter you can see the diameter is consistent we looked at the trilobal design and the pattern does show that.
Chemical tests revealed that both sets of fibers had didn't died with the same chemicals.
But fiber evidence on like DNA or fingerprint is not definitive.
The presence of the fibers being consistent with the fibers in the vehicle is non identification to the exclusion of all others it's not an absolute there's no way anyone should to come to court and there's no way anyone can come to court and testify that that fiber came from that carpet it's just not gonna happen.
But even more damning evidence against officer owes Walt would come from Margie's six year old son brand.
The circumstantial evidence and Margie coffees murder all pointed to lieutenant Charles swapped so did the forensic evidence to red carpet fibers on Margie's clothing were microscopically similar to the carpet in those walls automobile.
But the question haunting police was motive if post war murdered Margie coffee.
Why did he do it.
After Margie had given birth to her second child Brandon she told social services that she couldn't identify the baby's father since the pregnancy was the result of a rape.
But later when she applied for financial aid at college she was required to identify Brandon's father and explain why she wasn't receiving child support.
And she became a Joe's witness and they began to council with her they found these details out they said look you can't lie here tell the truth and she named a Choco small as the father.
With this news prosecutors Pasco's wall to undergo a paternity test.
It reveals the likelihood of Oswald being Brandon's father was greater than ninety nine percent.
Investigators also discovered that does what had refused to pay for child support when Margie asked possibly because he didn't want his wife to find out about his infidelity.
The general school was married had children in fact up until all this broke his wife didn't know anything about Margie coffee did not know that he had a child by another woman and so I'm sure that her finding that out certainly was motive for what happened.
small allegedly offered Margie a few thousand dollars from an insurance settlement which Margie refused as insufficient.
During Charles owes waltz murder trial prosecutors presented one more piece of evidence against a woman who once worked for police as a decoy in prostitution investigations Charlene dry Sawyer testified that she too had been having an affair with those will.
Sawyer claimed those walls had not only told her he murdered Margie coffee he also provided details of the crime.
So you're said that after o's Walton Margie saw one another in the diner they went to Smaltz police car to talk.
They discussed the child support matters and post war offer of three thousand dollars to end the dispute fifty three thousand.
Always walk responded by strangling her with the rooms.
The forensic evidence reveals does walk Margie's life plus body in the backseat of his police car worker code and leg warmers picked up the tiny red triangular shaped cockpit five.
Later prosecutors say post wardrobe to the bridge over possum run creek and dumped the body into the water in the mistaken belief that any incriminating evidence would be washed downstream.
You know when it's yellow on the walls in a crisis probably a duck and that's a case that we had here.
At his trial.
Anna does Walt took the stand in his own defense and denied killing Margie coffee.
He repeated his claim that he had been working alone that night on a drug investigation and offered the type police report to prove it.
But prosecutors contended that the report was bogus implying that owes Walt himself had tied the phone the report after the merger to give himself an alibi.
The jury found lieutenant Charles Oswald guilty of voluntary manslaughter and abusing a corpse.
He was sentenced to ten to twenty five years in prison.
To this day.
Post war insists he did not kill Margie coffee.
And he may go to the grave denied it.
I thank I think he is guilty now if I'm wrong god forgive me.
For residents of Mansfield the ultimate the trail is a policeman who commits murder.
I mean it's bad enough to murder someone but then when you supposed to be of protecting people and then use of the office of authority to kill someone then that's the lowest murder that I can thank god.
I really believe.
Prosecutors say that it was solid police work and some luck that helped seal the case.
Presence of these red fibers in that carpet.
I play shot in the dark.
The uniqueness of that police car being bought at auction the chances that one in a million.
And without the forensic evidence lieutenant Oswald might not have been brought to justice I'd say this was one of the key pieces of evidence and it would have been more difficult for a jury to have convicted him if not impossible.
