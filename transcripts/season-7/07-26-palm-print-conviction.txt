One of summer's evening a woman left a bar in anchorage Alaska and staggered into the street she was drunk she was defenseless and soon.
The killer left this unusual to the crime scene.
It was evidence that could be visualized with the simple to.
August eighth nineteen ninety six with a beautiful summer morning in anchorage Alaska but on this day workers entering a downtown office building saw something different.
The first letter of experience like this I remember one experience it again this is horrible.
It was a body.
Laying near a wooded area.
The incident appeared to be breathing the woman's checked jacket and clothing were strewn over a thirty foot area a clear indication of the life and death struggles was an extended assaultive wasn't he just hit her in the face once or multiple blows to her head and her upper chest area.
She had been so badly beaten up visual identification would be impossible.
She didn't match missing persons reports and apparently there had been no witnesses.
Any time you have a witness less crime you have difficulties you don't have anybody telling you where to go were a lock who to ask and what to do.
The victim had been moved or touched since she was discovered and the body had been protected from the sun light.
Because of where the victim was found and the circumstances surrounding her death captain bill Gifford made an unusual decision.
I made the decision that we would go ahead and try to get but Chris off the body.
For the last six years Gifford had been experimenting with the special technique to find hidden fingerprints on human skin.
Superglue fuming is usually done with non porous surfaces like glass or metal.
In the early eighties a gluing factory in Japan the employees had noticed that as they were gluing various items together that the vapors which were materializing from the glue returning the fingerprints their actual prints on an item a whitish color.
Subsequently they brought the information to tension the Japanese crime lab and from that with furs organizational meetings they pass information on to do it with skin the following conditions must be in place.
No a merchant see personnel could have handled the body they would white prints off and also leave their own if the victim is dead for a long period of time the K. will destroy any prints any precipitation even deal can wash away prince and the temperature must be right if it's too hot the prince will melt if it's too cold they'll disintegrate.
A different order technicians to build a tent around the body using plastic tarp and PVC pipe.
Inside different he did a pan of water to increase the humidity in the tent.
Using a heat gun a massive amount of super glue was blown into the air tight container around the body.
Different secret technique was to use more super glued and forensic scientists usually recommend in this case probably three or four hundred times the amount of what we normally use on skin and this time we got the right amount.
The heated glue attach is itself to the biological oils left by someone's fingers or hands the glue then hardens on the print and can be photographed.
This isn't a technique that can be re done.
Fortunately in this case it worked.
On the victim's left by was a fragment of a palm print from the killer is left hand.
We were ecstatic and this was the second latent print off of human skin that had been confirmed so to finally get one.
What a milestone.
I could tell based on the slope of the terrain and the location of the of the print and injuries that were selected to the victim exactly which hand it was because the individual had steady themselves by placing their hand on the thigh area while they were conducting whatever injuries are sustained into the victim.
Above the body on some low hanging branches.
Police discovered thirty five head hairs which did not come from the victim.
It appeared the branches became entangled in the assailants here during the assault.
Police now had the palm print and possibly a hair sample from the killer.
All they needed now was to identify the victim and find the suspect.
When the body of the victim was taken to the morgue in anchorage Alaska the medical examiner determined that she was an Alaska native between thirty and forty years old five foot two inches tall and weighing a hundred pounds.
He found a bite mark on the woman's breast and signs she had been sexually assaulted.
There were some bloody boot impressions on the victim's torso but they weren't clear enough to identify in this particular case the violence didn't indicate whether that they would be known to one another but what it did tell us is that the suspect spent considerable time.
with the victim both before and after that.
The toxicology report indicated that the victim had a blood alcohol level of point three O. eight over four times the legal limit.
Anchorage police check missing persons reports but found no one resembling their victim.
At the crime scene above the body in some low hanging branches police found human hair.
The hair is presumably the assailants were analyzed and identified as mongoloid.
Mongoloid hairs are from Asian races native Americans would be included in this category.
Mongoloid hairs tend to have very dark pigmentation the hairs on almost look black visually.
And they tend to be very straight.
The hairs were very long between eighteen and twenty inches and they were highly unusual.
This is one of the most distinctive hair samples that I've ever seen.
The long hairs had been bleached and because mongoloid hairs are so dark in color this type of chemical treatment has a distinct effect.
When they add bleach to it it pulls some of the pigment out benefits and complete the hair almost looks orangish.
Police were now looking for a native Alaska male with long black hair down to his waist with the non even our inch tent.
I don't know who the assailant was we had no idea what that person was going to do whether this was going to be a series of crimes and for the first week or so we certainly had concerns that we had a person or persons capable of committing such a heinous crime walking around our community without us able to identify who that person was.
Since the victim had a high alcohol content at the time of her death.
Police campus bars in downtown anchorage many of which are popular with the native community.
Many of the bars have extensive video surveillance systems for liability purposes the sway bar owners can prove they have been served anyone who was visibly intoxicated bar owners decide whether they want to have these videotapes systems or not and then install them their own so there's no mandate for it they do this on a voluntary basis.
Police collected the surveillance tapes from every downtown bar that had a video system and look through the hours of footage.
One video tape was from an outside surveillance camera taken on the night of the murder.
Fortunately the picture was relatively clear for a night scene.
Even at nine or ten o'clock at night the sun is still shining in Alaska since it's so far north this is why Alaska is called the land of the midnight sun.
On this one tape was a clear image of a woman wearing a checked jacket like the one found at the crime scene she was walking down the street arm in arm with a man with long black hair.
I would say the video image of the individual spare it wasn't real clear but it was fair enough that we could feel comfortable to go out and begin searching for the person it was enough that we can get an idea of who might be.
The trick was to find out the individual's identity.
Anchorage police uncovered this video surveillance image thought to be their victims and the killer taken on the night of the murder.
The videotape was from a surveillance system at a bar in downtown anchorage called the Avenue.
The bar had nine tiny video surveillance cameras in operation at all times.
Almost every square foot of the bar and the entrance and exit our all covered.
The bar owner John T. says the surveillance is not a luxury it's a necessity.
It also manages another body it gives you the opportunity to have maybe a couple fewer employees yeah you can monitor you know seven or eight different locations within the bar.
When police showed the surveillance picture to John Patty he could not identify the man in the image.
He knew the woman her name was Martha Hanson hello caller Marty she was a regular customer since I've been here I've known her but just as a customer and a tiny little girl you know never cause a problem.
A background check revealed Martha Hanson was a forty eight year old divorced mother of six children and was unemployed so it's just a very trusting very open with people and it didn't matter who you were should reach out to you I think that was.
Probably what the down fall is here.
She'S been gone for two days before her children reported her missing which is why police had not connected her to their victim.
Patty said that on the night of the murder Martha Hanson was in his bar and was denied service the Martinez first engaging with that bar doing determined that she was too intoxicated to be in here so we also believe in and she left.
Martha was inside for less than five minutes.
Intrinsic remembered her but did not remember seeing the man in the surveillance image.
It appeared that the man never entered the bar so there was no clear shot of his face.
The best images unfortunately were Martha Hanson and the suspect walking away from the bar so we have the back of the subject as opposed to the front.
The image showed Martha and the man walking arm in arm which suggested the two knew one another we're canvassing the area again going back to the business is going back to the retailers going back to people saying do you know who this person is.
When police put the photograph in the local newspaper a concerned citizen called with some information.
She said that a week after the merger of Martha Hanson one of her friends blurted out that he killed someone.
When she asked him how he held up his hands indicating that he'd either get or strangled his victim or both.
Her initial instinct was he's just bragging he's intoxicated he couldn't do something like this.
The man's name was Evans Lee Curtis.
With here so long it fell almost to his waist Curtis was unemployed with no prior arrests.
Evans Curtis fit the photo that we received from the videotape to a tee.
Curtis had left his pants in this woman's bedroom.
They appear to be similar to those in the surveillance image.
When police analyzed those pants they discovered they were spattered with blood.
At the news Lee Curtis was interrogated by police but he denied any involvement in Martha Hanson's murder but that having your own right in mind that we talked about you want to talk to about.
Police had the surveillance image the hairs and the palm print of the killer.
The question now was whether the forensic evidence would match Evans Lee Curtis.
Evans Lee Curtis said he had nothing to do with the murder of Martha Hanson he claimed the man in the video image because someone else that he certainly wasn't the only man in anchorage with long hair.
But his long hair was distinctive it had the same unusual color as the hairs found at the crime scene the suspect's hair was also chemically treated was very long and links and the chemical treatment was a regular along the line the same as what I found in the head and the hair is from the same.
Investigators wanted something more conclusive they wanted to know if the partial palm print found on Martha Hanson stock belonged to critics.
Police took impressions of his hands focusing more on this poms than his fingertips.
Investigators were looking for the distinctive crease between the index and middle fingers they found on Martha Hanson Stein.
When compared there was no mistaking it the print on the body was from Evans Lee Curtis that presents him with a serious problem that problem is how does he explain why his palm print is on a dead woman.
The print evidence while significant was subject to defense attack.
A super glue fuming process was so unusual investigators were concerned whether it would be allowed as evidence.
So they conducted DNA testing of the blood found on Curtis's pants.
When the blood on the pants was compared to DNA from Martha Hanson's blood DNA.
It was a match.
We have no idea why I love to stand behind the work that he did.
But perhaps the most damning clue was found on the boats Curtis was wearing at the time of his arrest.
They were given to forensic analyst Jim wolf.
In a crevice on the boot soles created by simple wear and tear he found what looked to be a small pocket of blood what really caught my eye what was on the victim's body appeared to be heel impression was some possible blood stains on the heel of the boot actually inside a heel that was or inside a hole that was worn into the heel.
The DNA from the show was compared to Martha Hansen's DNA.
Prosecutor David Wallace had one of the best cases of his career in this case it was forensically solid.
Mr Curtis would have had a lot of explaining to do how all of these pieces of the puzzle we're not him when I had multiple experts going to take a stand and say it was in fact Mr Curtis that killed Martha Hanson.
Police discovered that Curtis knew Martha Hanson's daughter and actually met Martha at a dinner party a few weeks before her murder she trusted Evans she is apparently been acquaintance with them he had been invited.
Over to the house a couple of times and I guess she is actually at fandom.
Prosecutors believe that when Martha left the Avenue bar she just happened to run into Curtis.
Recognizing one another they walked down the street comment on possibly on their way to another night spot.
But instead Curtis took Martha to a secluded area and made a sexual advance.
When she rejected him Curtis attacked.
In the ensuing fight Curtis caught some of his hair in a tree branch here which had a distinct orange bleaching.
Curtis got blood on his pants.
The most unusual piece of forensic evidence was his partial palm print on Martha's a left thigh.
Since he left the body under the trees protected from the sun light and excessive moisture the conditions were perfect to preserve the print four hours after she died.
Reviving one final clue in a mosaic of evidence that ultimately identified Evans Lee Curtis.
Not aware of any other case in Alaska where a palm print fingerprints or any type of France's been lifted from a deceased person.
When faced with the overwhelming amount of forensic evidence Evans Lee Curtis decided to plead guilty yesterday brutal killing.
Evans Lee Curtis was sentenced to ninety nine years in prison.
His conviction a combination of old fashioned police work high tech forensic science and a little bit of luck video tape evidence in conjunction with the palm prints and other evidence seen were.
Just over and above what we could've hoped for.
What we have in technology give something a shot.
And that doesn't work modify it give something else a shot.
But there is untold things out there that will eventually be employed where we will be making identifications of people.
Today would think impossible.
Forensic technology is extremely important in many many cases whether it's homicide to simple fast because if you don't have a confession if you don't have an eye witness to the crime you have nothing so with forensic evidence we are able to circumstantially piece together a puzzle that may never have been pieced together before.
