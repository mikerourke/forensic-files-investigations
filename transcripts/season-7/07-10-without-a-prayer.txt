Madalyn Murray o'hair was America's best known atheist principally responsible for abolishing prayer in public school.
You'Re either locked.
In nineteen ninety five Madeline Murray o'hare mysteriously disappeared from her Texas home along with her son John Mari and granddaughter robin.
Over six hundred thousand dollars of their organization's money disappeared along with them.
What is it not to love about the story involves green gold involves the most hated woman in America this is a sexy story and we should talent.
It was a local newspaper reporter playing forensic detective who helped solve the case.
I don't remember Madeline Murray o'hare was often called the most hated woman in America records.
Is this a form of harassment I will leave I am creating no you're not wasting my time these are the risks when you're done reading that call me in the ladies room is it your understanding and you have brought me into the ladies room when you are done.
She was on about atheists to achieve fame in nineteen sixty three by opposing prayer in public schools.
She took her case all the way to the United States Supreme Court and won.
She founded the nonprofit group the American atheists as well as a magazine preaching the gospel of strict separation of church and state.
She also wrote articles for Larry Flynt's hustler magazine and was the subject of a playboy magazine interview.
Madeleine o'hare was a difficult woman to work with and was notorious for speaking her mind documents like that don't get me.
I have never encountered a more better more distasteful person Madalyn Murray o'hair.
She was extremely foul mouth to the point that even though we were doing an interview about something that she wanted us to do a story on we had to stop the interview in the middle because she was cursing so much.
Have a limited opportunity this morning that.
In August of nineteen ninety five seventy seven year old Madeline her forty year old son John and thirty year old granddaughter robin left Austin Texas without saying a word to anyone.
The staff of the American atheist organization found a note on their office door saying the hairs had been called away for an emergency and didn't know when they would return.
John'S Mercedes bands and Robbins Porsche were gone too but they left their passports behind as well as Madeline's diabetes medicine and her three dogs.
Matalin may not have cared very much for people but she sure love those dogs we were told I couldn't get in touch with them and I got concerned so I started making phone calls and then I called John cell phone and that's when Madden answered.
Madeline would tell board member Ellen Johnson where she wants.
Johnson said the calls were short and strained and she worried that Madeline and her son were under some sort of the rest.
Question to him about what was going on and and you know he tried to reassure me that everything was okay and I believed it.
Just one month later Madeline and John stopped answering their cell phone calls.
When Ellen Johnson took over the American atheist group and Madeline's absence she discovered that since the here's disappeared more than six hundred thousand dollars was missing from the organization's bank.
Suddenly you have three people and a very large amount of money all despairing at the same time and this makes it far more interesting.
John McCormick covered the disappearance for the express news in San Antonio Texas among the eighties there was a very peculiar silence but beneath it was a very profound concern they were very concerned they didn't know what to do they hadn't really attempted to get any help from law enforcement.
No one associated with the American atheists reported the three missing it wasn't until a year later bill Maher Madeline's estranged son filed a missing persons report with Boston police.
Madeline and bill had a rocky relationship.
In nineteen eighty on mother's day bill told Nightline that he had embraced Christianity and was no longer an atheist he then went public writing a book and making a film attacking his mother's belief.
My mother loved confrontations and she never hesitated to use me as an accomplice in her scheme she wanted to push the school prayer issue as far as she could so she instructed me to keep a record of prayer and Bible reading at school it was here in my home my mother made me a spy for the cause of atheism.
Madeline immediately disowned and bill never again spoke with his mother his brother John or his daughter rob.
Bill didn't know if his family's disappearance was foul play or if they had stolen the atheists money and fled.
A year after Madeline Murray o'hare disappeared with their son John Mari and granddaughter robin journalist John McCormick learned what the American atheists group already knew that John Mari had withdrawn over six hundred thousand dollars from the atheist bank account just weeks after the three disappeared.
McCormick also examined John cell phone records which indicated he had been living in San Antonio Texas after his disappearance many of the two hundred calls were suspicious.
They'Ve been caught financial institutions they've been calling airlines they've been calling drug stores to get Matalin's prescriptions they were more than a hundred fifty calls the call jewelry stores.
One of those jewelry stores was on Fredrickson road in San Antonio.
The owner said that John Murray purchased six hundred thousand dollars worth of gold coins using cash.
Even after Madeleine son Bill Murray reported the three missing the Austin police showed little interest there was no investigation by the Austin police department it was a total joke.
The police reaction may have been based on their belief that Madeline and her family absconded with the ATS money and that it was an internal matter.
How can somebody that's that famous turn up missing with all that money and still no one wants to look for so I decided I'd be part of the team the one looking.
Television news reporter Valerie Williams discovered the John Marie sold his Mercedes Benz for fifteen thousand dollars well below the card's value to this man mark sparrow.
The seller identified himself as John mark.
But when shown a picture of John Mara.
Barrow said it wasn't the man who sold him the car names of the guys on the car.
After reviewing mugshot picture is Mister sparrow identified the impersonator as another missing person.
And next convict named Danny from this was an interesting coincidence.
Denny price family told police that Danny had been working with another ex convict David waters who had once worked for Madeleine o'hare and had a falling out.
In nineteen ninety three Madeline hired David waters as our office manager.
Within a few months she fired him maintaining he had stolen fifty thousand dollars from the atheist organization.
Waters was charged with that he accepted a plea agreement and paid the money back and in so doing avoided jail time.
Madeline was furious that authorities allowed waters to go free.
Using the power of the pen Madeline wrote an article in our magazine exposing waters as a thief and implied waters had homosexual relationships while serving an early year prison sentence for assault.
Rains say he followed with a.
Journalist John McCormick cold waters and asked him if he had anything to do with Madeleine's disappearance.
I don't believe a word he said but that he spoke as though was it was the truth.
McCormick discovered that David waters Danny Friday and another ex convict Gary Carr all working together in Austin Texas around the time the o'hare's disappeared in August of nineteen ninety five.
And not long afterwards a headless handlers male torso was discovered in a Dallas record.
Nate spent three years trying to forget who it was but they no fingerprints no dental and they had no missing persons records that match this disappearance so they were totally stopped.
Not long after the here's disappeared.
A male torso was found in a Dallas river without a head or hands fingerprints and dental records couldn't be used for identification.
For Rancic anthropologist estimated the man to be between the ages of thirty five and forty five he had a stocky build and a lot of chest hair.
The description didn't fit Madeline son John.
The journalist John McCormick had a hunch he told police that it might be Danny Frye the man who impersonated John Mari when selling his car.
Scientists took DNA from Danny fries brother and compared it to the blood DNA of the torso.
It was a match.
Just as McCormick suspected the dead man in the river was Danny fry.
The blockbuster was when we could write a story that said that the headless corpse in Dallas was Danny fried by the way he was last seen with David waters in Austin and by the way he spends last month in San Antonio with the same time the here's to so that really kicked in the door.
Such local state and federal law enforcement officials took notice and joined the investigation.
When David waters ex girlfriend the staff and read about Danny fries merger in the newspaper she immediately called the FBI.
At first she wanted to tell a small bits and pieces you have to understand this was a woman who was terrified.
She gave investigators and importantly.
Three years earlier she said the David waters had rented a storage unit around the time the o'hare's disappeared and that waters had once gone there with this spray canister.
Laboratory tests on the canister revealed it had once contained bleach which is sometimes used to remove blood evidence.
Armed with a search warrant police found tiny red stain beneath a piece of aluminum under the.
It was so small.
With blood from madman son bill for comparison a mitochondrial DNA test revealed the stain was a mixture of two.
Madeline Murray o'hare and her son John.
Next the FBI searched the waters apartment.
We found documents that belong to the hairs that were dated after David waters had been fired from their organization Mr waters are himself a prior convicted felon who was not allowed to have guns or ammunition was found to be an illegal possession of about a hundred and eighteen rounds of handgun ammunition three different calibers.
The FBI confronted David waters with the forensic and physical evidence against.
It took quite a while.
But eventually five and a half years after the here's disappeared waters led investigators to a remote site at camp with Texas.
When we hit the first phone it was kind of interesting in this case because the phone was very large and it was the upper leg bones the upper leg bone is the largest bone or skeleton but this one was particularly large.
After twenty one hours of excavation.
Three adult bodies were uncovered.
In each case the legs had been cut off.
Possibly to make it easier to transport the body and one of the bodies there was very well intact a female skull and there was paraded down the back of the of the neck of the individual.
There were some remnants of clothes that were found but no clothes that were intact.
There had been some effort to burn the remains unknown to the border cremation but in order to destroy or maybe the clothing or any other.
You know DNA evidence that might be there.
As the remains were on earth.
Shining in the afternoon sun.
As the metal plate of an artificial.
Medical records revealed that Madeleine o'hare had undergone hip replacement surgery several years before her disappearance.
The serial number of the hip and Madeline's medical file match the number on the hip in the gray.
Currency code on Thomas just compared the here's dental records to the skulls in the gray and confirm that these were the remains of Madeline our son John and granddaughter robin.
For John Murray when he was in the grave and I'm covered he did have a plastic bag over his skull.
And when the plastic bag was removed there were small fractures that occurred to the skull itself indicating some blunt trauma had been done to him during the time of his death.
The cause of death for Madeline and robin could be determined by looking at the phone.
But since their heads were covered in plastic it was assumed they were asphyxiated.
But investigators found something else an extra hand and two extra hands.
The head showed a single gunshot wound at the base of the skull.
They suspected the skull was that of Danny Frye the man whose torso was found in the Dallas river.
For example the distance between the eyes and the shape of the nose and the distance between the nose to the T. the distance across the cheeks in every area that I examined in the video superimposition matched up.
The motive for the here's merger had been revenge but why Danny for high.
The forensic evidence found years after the here's disappearance Titan David waters and his two associates Danny fry and Gerry car to their mergers.
David waters girlfriend Patty Stephens told police headquarters kidnapped the o'hare is because of the unflattering and inflammatory article Madeline had written about.
His girlfriend said he fantasized about torturing her cutting off her toes and so basically I think this whole thing came down to it not just money but really ugly personal chemistry between two dysfunctional personalities for David waters it was about revenge he one of the ultimate revenge on Madeleine o'hare and the money was just a by product.
After kidnapping the o'hare's waters forced John Murray to withdraw six hundred thousand dollars from the atheist bank account and then took him to the jewelry store to exchange the six hundred thousand dollars for gold coins.
The here's where most likely dead by the time Danny fry in person they did John Mari to sell his car.
But why was Danny Friday killed two.
The answer was his drinking.
We knew that Danny fry drank and loose lips sink ships and by with David told Bob fry about his brother and that was you know your brother has a big mouth could be the thing that caused his death.
But David waters made several crucial mistake.
All the water is clean the room with water and bleach scientists still found.
Three years later identified by mitochondrial DNA as Adam John Mari and Madeleine o'hare.
But removing Danny fries head and hands still didn't prevent identification.
After stealing the six hundred thousand dollars from the hairs waters never got the opportunity to enjoy the money.
It was stolen from him.
But first mistake was putting his money in a in a storage locker up in Austin and having three bozos from San Antonio who were looking for use T. V.'s open up the locker with a master key and find a suitcase with a half million in gold.
For his role in this case.
David waters was sentenced to eighty years in prison.
His accomplice Gary Carr was sentenced to life in prison.
Mister car fleet media's role in involvement with David waters in the abduction robbery and murder of the affairs and he indicated that he had assisted in dismembering the bodies and putting the body parts in fifty five gallon drums in a storage unit here and and often and was a nice neat ending they found the bodies the bad guy goes to prison and the you know the heroes right off into the sunset for his persistence John McCormick is one of the heroes of this case.
And around six science played an important role.
A lot of times I kind of forget about the case when the next case comes in and so I really don't have one that always jumps to mind but I remember this one for a long time.
