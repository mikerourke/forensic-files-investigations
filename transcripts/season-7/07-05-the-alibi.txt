In nineteen ninety one a high school girl vanished after attending a party abandoned vehicle was found in the school parking lot near her home.
The prime suspect had not one but two alibi witnesses for the night she disappeared.
A solid alibi can often overcome much circumstantial evidence.
But forensic evidence is another matter.
On a Saturday night in November of nineteen ninety one seventeen year old crystal fate Todd was dropped off in a mall parking lot after attending a party.
Since crystal didn't have to be home for another hour she said she was going to get something to eat before heading home.
It was the last time crystal was seen alive.
When she wasn't home by one AM her mother contacted police.
She also called crystal's best friend can register who said he hadn't seen crystal all night.
They found her car the next morning in a nearby school parking lot.
Seventeen year old crystal Faye Todd was a senior in high school living in the small tobacco farming town of Conway South Carolina.
Crystals dad died when she was very young.
She grew up as a happy child active in her church song in the youth group choir and dreamt of going to college.
Just a few hours after crystals abandoned car was found in a school parking lot.
Two hundred in a remote field noticed a trail of blood.
It led to a nearby ditch.
They are late a woman's body with multiple stab wounds and partially disrobed.
It was brutal.
And it was it's it's a saying that will be with me for a long time it was sexual in nature I mean it wasn't a murder just to murder someone they were sexual gratification.
On the victim's finger.
Was a high school ring.
And great on the inside was the name crystal Todd.
I just wish it to be in me instead of her.
Investigators thought the perpetrator might have been from outside the area but forensic evidence at the crime scene pointed much closer to home.
Residents of Conway South Carolina recalled my crystal Faye Todd senseless murder.
Medical examiner Dr Jamie downs performed the autopsy she did have the defense injury to the left hand because we thought that odd at the time.
Why would someone have defended themselves with their left hand she was right handed one a user right hander dominant hand.
The answer was discovered soon enough one of the stab wounds penetrated the left side of her skull which would have immediately paralyzed her right side.
What is the defense will tell.
Judge victims conscious Italian the victim was not down it tells you the victim was.
Some of the wounds didn't cause bleeding an indication they were made after death the victim is completely.
Dead the victim is a is now longer struggling yet defender still had enough anger that he and size or cut the body after death.
She was stabbed thirty one times.
The term that we use is over kill that's more wounding that is necessary to take someone's life.
When Dr downs measured the wounds he concluded that the murder weapon was a three and a half inch knife the type with the blade that locks in place.
It would have had to be a locking blade or it couldn't have penetrated the skulls.
Forensic evidence confirmed she had been sexually assaulted.
And that she was murdered on one side of the road and the body dumped on the other.
Well what it told me as he was panicking and he simply wanted disassociate himself from the crime it told me that you probably have never killed before he was an experience in this type of a crime.
In search for suspects investigators first look through crystals personal papers.
Friends say crystal meth tend all through a mutual acquaintance.
Kendall was a thirty one year old convicted thief wanted in Alabama for a parole violation.
Police also discovered that he had a taste for high school girls no doubt about it we thought we had a man he fit what we were looking for.
For N. six scientists to value waited the rate test kit from crystals autopsy and discovered that the killer had typed over with an extremely rare blood subtype characterized by the enzyme PGM.
It stands for phospho glucose.
That is an enzyme that is stable in body fluids from from individuals.
The blood type the secretive status and the PGM subtype made him approximately two percent of the population.
And the DNA profile of the perpetrator was highly unusual as well.
We found that the profile was in fact a rare and occurred with a frequency of approximately one in two hundred and fifty million Caucasians and one in one point five billion blacks.
Surprisingly this forensic information exonerated their prime suspect and detained.
More than one thousand people attended crystal fatalities funeral.
Crystal'S best friends served as her pallbearers.
Grieving mother and police appeal to the community for any information about the crime.
In response a resident of Conway came forward to say he had driven by the school parking lot on the night crystal disappeared and salt crystals car with a man and a woman standing beside it.
Now police had another lead.
Police sketch of his description looked to many like crystal's mother Bonnie and her boyfriend.
There'S no question in my mind as I sit here today the individual in that sketch was Bonifay Todd's boyfriend.
Police wondered just how much crystal's mother knew about the merger.
A witness told police that on the night crystal disappeared he had seen two people standing near crystal's car in the parking lot.
His description matched crystal's mother and her mother's boyfriend.
But when questioned further the witness admitted he had been drinking that night and may have seen crystal's mother on Sunday morning when she and her boyfriend found crystal's car.
With Bonnie no longer a suspect and their previous suspect Andy Tindal exonerated by DNA testing investigators had no other leads.
So police commissioned a behavioral profile of the killer.
Criminal behavior profiling is when you have an unsolved case and you study the crime and the behavior of the offender during the commission of the crime and you arrive the characteristics it's a subjective opinion you arrive the characteristics and traits of the unidentified offenders such as age race marital status arrest history educational level things of that nature.
The profile suggested that crystals killer was a white male in his early twenties and was a friend of crystals who lived within three miles of her home.
The young man was angry and probably had a police record he was physically strong above all the profiles suggested that he was confident he would never be considered a suspect.
Since the profile suggested that the killer was one of crystal's friends police asked her male classmates and acquaintances to voluntarily give blood samples for DNA testing.
Despite the challenge to their civil liberties fifty two man complied.
It wasn't anything voluntary but they still had a pool.
And you know and then when they pulled the name then they would ask if you would go down and and give the DNA tests or give the specimen.
And everybody volunteered it was I haven't heard of anybody not doing it.
Incredibly one of those DNA profiles matched the DNA of the perpetrator donor number forty four.
When investigators asked crystal's mother to name the one person she would least expect to hurt her daughter.
And I said can rate.
Can register and crystal Todd had known each other since childhood.
Their relationship wasn't romantic they were simply.
They spoke together almost every day and it was can whom Mrs Todd first call for help on the night crystal disappeared can had also been one of crystal's pallbearers.
When police checked can register his background they discovered two troubling pieces of information.
First he had an explosive temper.
And he also had a criminal record.
Two months earlier to local college students accused register of exposing himself when he stopped to ask for directions.
Three years before that as a fifteen year old register was caught making obscene telephone calls to this woman in which she described in detail how he wanted to assault and murder.
He said he would be wide open and many other.
The merger register described in these calls was identical to the merger of crystal Faye Todd.
Exactly where were you the night.
But can register was flabbergasted when told his blood DNA matched crystals killer.
He asked police rhetorically why he would have agreed to a blood test if he was the killer.
When police search registers cars they could find no evidence linking him to the crime scene.
Register also had an alibi his girlfriend said he was with her at this go kart track that night and his mother said can was home by twelve thirty that Alabama banished from which you're going to get.
A very surprising to me and it's always compelling evidence.
I know where I was at.
When I was at dinner that night right here at my house and I know when he came.
Although can register his mother was his alibi witness she would later play a key role in solving crystal pods merger.
Crystal Todd's best friend can register was now the prime suspect in her murder.
His DNA matched the DNA found at the crime scene but he insisted he was innocent and provided two alibi witnesses his girlfriend and his mother.
Ken had been a regular guest in crystal's home but Mrs Todd said she knew nothing about his criminal past if I don't know that indecent exposure and threatening phone calls in Richmond neighborhoods fit my hand.
And Mrs Todd now reveals something her daughter told her which may hint at the motive in a week and a half before she was killed she said.
You can score this again during police questioning can register denied any involvement in the murder but towards the end of a six hour interrogation police told him his mother had sent him a message.
Mother says to tell us exactly what happened.
Do you mother since everything will be okay.
And with that.
Can register confessed.
I did it.
He said he saw crystal around midnight at a traffic light near the school parking lot Hey crystal.
Wait just a part.
Okay crystal dot into his car they drove to a deserted location where register said the two had consensual sex.
The forensic evidence suggests it wasn't consensual at all.
Okay I'm telling you right now if I get pregnant.
When she got out of the car to get dressed register said he grabbed a hunting knife from the car.
Further sexual activity took place after death.
Other than the mere fact she got the car where.
Prosecutors believe that register clean test car sometime after the crime to remove possible evidence.
The evidence was had been systematically destroyed before we realized that he was a suspect.
He'S found an empty box of box for a knife with a locking blade.
Rancic scientists determined that the missing night would have been similar to the weapon used to inflict crystal stab wounds.
Before the trial register recanted his confession saying it was coerced he said police lied to him about the contents of his mother's note.
But lying to a suspect during a police interrogation is perfectly legal.
There'S no doubt in my mind that Mr register brutally and viciously killed Christopher Todd and there's also no doubt my mind that he enjoyed doing it.
I mean there's just too much time on account for he had plenty ample time to do everything that he was accused up and still be home when he said he got home.
Why did register willingly give a blood sample for DNA testing if he was the perpetrator.
Published reports say that when police requested a DNA sample can register asked what is DNA.
At the time D. N. A. testing had been used in criminal cases for about five years but register was apparently unfamiliar with it since it hadn't yet been used in the state of South Carolina.
His case was the first.
Can register was convicted of murder kidnapping and sexual assault he was sentenced to life in prison plus thirty five years.
Can register and his family still say he is innocent.
Several subsequent DNA tests of all confirmed the original findings.
I know but I know because I know I was home that night and I know when he came home I can explain the DNA I wished I could there's there's so many questions in this that you can explain.
Based on everything that I know about the violence of this crime and he says that when he left the scene of that murder he would have been a bloody mess of things a lot of cabinet going on in that house.
Bonnie Faye Todd visits crystals gray faithfully and she thank science for bringing crystals killer to justice.
I love you more.
Without the DNA in the blood we would never got to first base probably never even made an arrest.
