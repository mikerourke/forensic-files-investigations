When a beautiful young woman in Ohio met a handsome young doctor it was love at first sight.
During candlelight dinners the two spoke of marriage with the ceremony on a distant beach at sunset.
But those plans were delayed when the prospective bride fell ill.
When medical science couldn't find the cause of the problem forensic science and hidden camera.
Thirty three years old Michelle Baker was ready to settle down get married and start a family.
Her dreams were soon realized when a girl friend introduced her to a soft spoken new doctor in town Dr Maynard Maan Singh the second.
XenApp this woman in the world at that point I mean he was he was a marine one stream he was very successful very good looking.
Michelle worked as a firefighter and a paramedic and the two shared an interest in emergency medicine.
Muncy was also thirty three years old both were divorced and there was an immediate attraction.
Within a month Dr Maan Singh moved into Machel small home in Huber heights Ohio.
The couple spent weekends caring for Maynard's two children from a previous marriage.
And soon Michelle had some happy news of a wrong.
She was going to have a baby.
He said bringing married thank you S. barefoot on the beach at sunset.
So the two flew off to Florida.
But on their first night there Maynard changed his mind asking Michelle if they could postpone the wedding so his family could attend I felt devastated I also felt like it that is the way that he wanted things to be then I had to respect his wishes.
Later that night the couple went to the hard rock cafe.
But after they left the restaurant Michelle had severe cramps and some light bleeding.
Fortunately with a fiance who is a doctor Maynard reassured her.
Children there was nothing to worry about.
He just had me lie down he said it was fine the next day it stopped.
After returning home from vacation Michelle saw her physician Dr John shy just to make sure everything was okay.
I tried to allay her concern because I don't think it's a big issue Michelle I think was primarily concerned because of her age and this being her first pregnancy she was frightened her concerns were that she had a history of endometriosis and she thought that might be a problem but I reassured her that the chance of a problem was remote.
Maynard purchased this three hundred twenty thousand dollar brick house for the couple to raise their new child.
All that much whirlwind as far as everything went the baby in there the romance that and just the unbelievable.
Situation all the way around.
Michelle'S pregnancy was a difficult one with increasing cramps and occasionally bleeding.
When neither Michelle's doctor or her fiance could determine the cause of her illness she did a little research of Iran and made her diagnosis it was a condition so rare medical experts could hardly believe it.
Although Michelle Baker and Dr Maynard Maan Singh were expecting a child and had plans to marry Maynard revealed some news which threaten those plans.
He admitted he still had lingering feelings for a former girlfriend Tammy Erwin despite their stormy past you've told all these people such horrible things about her and what kind of person she is an asset and and you still have feelings for her.
Over the fourth of July weekend in two thousand Michelle planned to stay home while Maynard left for a fishing trip with a friend about an hour's drive away we spent the morning together and a good morning really good morning and he packed some clothes and he left.
Let'S go to the request line from Huber heights hello what can I play for you yeah I was wondering if you could play it later that night while listening to a local radio station Michelle heard a familiar voice calling in to request a song.
And I was just stopped right there and just stopped dead in my tracks and I listened.
The J. Asselin said room here is this in your head Maynard you want to dedicate this to anyone now suspecting she had been lied to Michelle asked a neighbor to drive her to the home Maynard's former girlfriend Tammy.
Michelle'S fears were confirmed when she saw him upside with.
This is what it looks like it's exactly what it looks like.
He had told her that he was living with a friend of his man all the while he was with me.
Michelle immediately through Maynard out of her home.
I was devastated I I just couldn't believe that someone could be.
That deceiving and and appear to be something that they're obviously not.
But a few days later Maynard called inviting Michelle to a picnic so the two could talk.
He apologized for his lapse in judgment and asked Michelle if they could get back together.
He turned to me and he said that he was very sorry about calling this seemed very sincere in what he was saying.
But the picnic was interrupted when Michelle got very sick.
I was so ill there at the park I couldn't even leave.
Leave the restroom and then five minutes later have to be right back in the restroom not only was by vomiting and diarrhea I also about forty minutes into this started bleeding.
Michelle immediately went to a doctor he could find nothing seriously wrong.
An ultrasound of the fetus was normal and once again we shall assume her symptoms were stress related.
With their relationship back on track the couple once again spoke of marriage he was a faction and now you've got my back watch TV with me and it seemed very normal.
But it happened again.
Michelle started cramping bleeding and vomiting.
And I thought that this was due to anxiety and stress and probably just internal pressure that developed when she saw her boyfriend.
But it was Michelle's twin sister Melinda who noticed an interesting coincidence she had said that don't you find it I think every time you're with him.
After he leaves your sec.
And I was just horrified by what she was implying.
Michelle recalled Maynard was the one who brought the drinks from the bar to their table in Florida shortly before she fell ill the first time.
And he also prepared her drink at the picnic before the second leading incident.
What was he doing to her drinks.
To find out.
She set a trap and was clever enough to videotape.
Michelle Baker was becoming increasingly suspicious of her fiance's behaviour.
Maynard told Michelle he was taking his children to Florida for a short vacation Machel suspected he was lying.
To find out Michelle drove to the home of Maynard's ex girlfriend and their sole Maynard's car.
Through an open window Michelle overheard Maynard and Tammy when discussing Michelle's pregnancy Jamie asked Maynard in what he intended to do about the baby and Maynard's response to her was she need not worry about that that as far as he knew that it could have already been taken care.
And it was at that point that.
Might be going on.
Michelle immediately told police about her suspicion that Maynard was trying to abort their child.
Laughter listen store I thought it was quite fantastic it's not the typical case that comes across my desk.
I was certainly skeptical first and thought I can't imagine that that someone would even do this spell my dreams something I have run into twenty five years of experience still trying to come.
Police wanted Michelle to take a lie detector test but department rules prohibit the tests to be done on pregnant women.
We told her basically because of his professional position that we were going to need all types of physical evidence that would show that is responsible for this.
But without proof there was little police could do so Michelle conducted her own investigation.
Inside the still plan to Michelle and her girlfriend he had a small video camera in her kitchen with a clear view of the kitchen counter top area.
I was scared I was afraid that he would say it.
She then invited Maynard to dinner.
As soon as he arrived Michelle said she was going outside to put the steaks on the grill and asked Maynard to prepare her a drink.
The videotape clearly revealed Maynard pouring an unknown substance into Meshaal's soft drink.
When he handed Michelle the drink she excused herself to go to the bathroom she had hidden in a plastic container.
For that dream into that container there was a white sludge in the bottom of my car an enormous amount may not not just a little bit but.
A very large amount.
And then I rinse my cop out I poured my new coke into that class in the other stuff I walked back out and sat down at the table.
I was second but I knew that this was the only weighing.
That I can prove this this is the only way that I could keep him away from my baby.
Getting through dinner was difficult Michelle wanted to get to drink to the police station quickly and throughout dinner her telephone rang incessantly it was Tammy.
Asking to speak with Maynard.
When Maynard finally left the telephone rang once more.
It was Maynard.
With some upsetting news.
He said to me do you want to know why Tammy so upset and I said yeah want to tell me why Tammy so upset he said because she's my wife.
The police immediately sent Michelle soft drink to the forensics lab my first reaction you gotta be kidding me we have no idea what we're looking for here it's not a typical forensic case and so we're we're going to start there's literally hundreds of drugs that this could be.
Police called the local pharmacist asking for a list of medications that can cause harm to the fetus if taken by a pregnant woman.
The most commonly prescribed drugs fitting that description was a stomach ulcer drug.
The contents of my shelves soft drink were placed in the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer the chromatograph separates the various elements the mass spectrometer analyzes.
By comparing the known side of tech that we receive from the pharmaceutical company we compare that to the substance that was found in the coca Cola and found a match therefore the coca Cola contains side attack.
It'S also a drug that is used in a very limited capacity to induce labor the actual effects of that particular drug or to actually start contractions.
But police had a problem.
There was no proof it was cited tech that Maynard was putting into the soft drink.
A clever defense attorney could claim that Michelle laced her own drink with a drug in order to frame him.
So police set a trap of their own.
Even though Michelle Baker had caught her fiance on videotape placing something in her drink authorities were concerned about whether this evidence which stand up in court.
We don't believe in just having a tape by the complainant and a sample by the complainant would have as much validity as a tape by ourselves.
Obtained by ourselves and the sample obtained by ourselves.
So a few days later.
Police set up their own surveillance camera in the shelves kitchen.
They placed it in a figurine of a firefighter saving a child.
Amara focused on the shelves kitchen counter.
Once again Machel invited Maynard over for dinner.
Myself and detective sergeant may or waiting in the garage and feeling what's going on in the kitchen like clockwork almost identical to the previous tape once Michelle Baker exited the residence with steaks on the grill Dr marching removed file from his pocket.
The two detectives rushed into the kitchen and arrested him.
I said I told you that you didn't have to have anything to do with this baby and said you tried to kill me and kill me.
I mean this guy had it all you know in a matter of six minutes Hey yeah destroyed his career and of course Michelle's life.
Dr Maan Singh cryptically explained why he had done it.
Basically poisoned drink in an attempt to remove the problem.
The question as to whether or not the problem.
Was that meant the baby he advised yes.
Lab tests confirmed that this drink was spiked with side impact.
A search of mine sings car trunk revealed even more side attack.
Dr Maynard Maan Singh was charged with the attempted murder of the baby.
That'S just despicable I'm ashamed to say that he's a physician I think that he misused his authority and his ability to obtain a substance and then he poisoned his ex fiance.
Despite ingesting cited text several times earlier we shall see disappeared normal.
I was at the doctor's office every week had high resolution ultrasound every month they were very very young.
Cautious as to what they were looking for.
Meanwhile financing was released on bond to await trial.
Shortly before the trial twenty eight weeks into her pregnancy Michelle gave birth to a stillborn baby girl whom she named makayla.
You were there when she was to let her and.
Tell her how much we loved her.
Since the coroner found no trace of side attacked in the placenta he ruled the cause of the baby's death as undetermined.
He did make oral statements as well as written statements admitting to.
What he was trying to do in this case and that he was trying to get rid of the baby that it was something he his wife didn't want him to have to deal with.
Michelle firmly believes that Maynard was responsible.
I know in my heart.
What he did my justices.
Knowing that he is eventually.
The judge because of the strain of trial would have placed on Michelle and her family prosecutors made a deal with Dr Maan Singh and his wife Tammy with Michelle's approval.
Munsey'S wife Tammy pleaded guilty to the charge of filling the prescription for the side attack she was put on probation.
Dr Maan Singh pleaded guilty to contaminating a substance for human consumption and attempted felonious assault.
He was sentenced to five years in prison.
He was also stripped of his medical license and will never be permitted to practice medicine in the United States again.
I have a lot of anger and a lot of hurt in a lot of questions and you know and.
It doesn't matter how much counseling I go to they can't answer any of those questions you know and it says it's it's difficult.
Fortunately it was Michelle suspicions good police work and new forensic technology that identified the drug quickly.
It could have been a very very long procedure that defined this drug because we we literally had no idea where to start or what we were looking for he could have taken us several months to determine what we have.
A delay of several months may have prevented police from capturing the crime a second time on videotape.
