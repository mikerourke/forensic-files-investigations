When a young woman walked outside her home to investigate a strange noise.
She was adopted.
The victim knew something about forensic evidence and she was determined to prove that she had been inside the assailants struck.
The clue she left behind and her recollection of details led police straight to the criminals front door.
Jackson township is just north of canton Ohio home to the pro football hall of fame.
It'S an upscale bedroom community.
Much of the area is undeveloped.
Especially along the old canal.
We have even areas where there's scallops and we get calls for cals and.
Livestock in the roadway.
The McKernan family live just two blocks from the canal.
Eighteen year old Stephanie McKernan shared the home with her husband Jamie and his eighteen year old sister whom we'll call make.
On Saturday night may sixth two thousand.
We were single and how old we were and we both said that we were not available.
The men were polite and when rebuffed drove off.
A few hours later after the women return home.
They heard a noise outside.
Megan grabbed the flashlight Stephanie picked up a can of spray paint both went outside to investigate.
They were met by a man with the right.
He claimed to be a police officer and ordered the girls to get into his truck and we were like no.
In the scuffle the assailant had stepped in with this rifle.
Megan the man in the face with a flashlight.
Stephanie regained consciousness she called police.
When police arrived Stephanie was hysterical and she was unable to provide much detail about the crime.
Police were skeptical since the McKernan boys had numerous prior run ins with police.
They'Re always running the motorcycle through the yards up and down the street they're always having a party they're always doing something always down here for something there's got to definitely be more to this than what's then what we now.
There was evidence at the scene to corroborate Stephanie's story.
Officers found Megan sweat shirt and sandals along with the cover for the scope of a rifle.
They were shoe prints leading in the direction the assailant was had.
At the bottom of the driveway police found tire impressions and near the road was a purple glove and an ice scraper.
My concern was I knew Meghan I knew her family I feared for the worst I fear that we were going to find a floating somewhere and if we didn't act fast that you know my fears may become a reality.
Over the next few hours Megan's family and the police searched the streets and parking lots of Jackson County.
But she was nowhere to be found.
Eighteen year old Megan McKernan was kidnapped at gun point from the backyard of a home.
Evidence left at the scene showed signs of a struggle but revealed little about the kidnapper's identity this was obviously someone that Megan had no knowledge of they were not familiar with and this was actually a legitimate thing that happened to me.
While investigators interviewed Megan's family and friends a police officer kept watch at the crime scene.
Suddenly the officer saw a woman running towards him.
It was Megan McKernan.
Her first words were I have been right.
An hour before we're looking for in a ditch so to see her come running towards me was.
Definitely a happy moment.
Police rushed make into a nearby hospital which had a special unit to treat rape victims and preserve crucial forensic evidence.
Nurses carefully collected and documented all of the evidence they could find and also preserve her blood stained clothing.
Police photographed scratches on Megan's face and other injuries including cuts and scrapes to work back and on.
She did what she needed to do to get through the situation and that is success in itself is to make it out alive.
Megan told police the assailant drove her to Boyd's corner in a remote location about five miles from her home and assaulted her in his truck.
Megan pleaded for the man to let her walk home.
He told me that he won't let me walk because I don't have no shoes on it was pretty far distance from my house.
In standing he offered to drive her.
She actually gave them better directions to get her back home there were two ways to get there and she actually talked to him about don't go this way go this way it's faster.
Megan was able to recall many important details about her assailant and his truck.
She said the truck was a Chevy S. ten blue with the dark cap.
There was an air freshener with the Tweety bird cartoon character hanging from the rear view mirror.
The interior was muddied with holes in the bench seat.
Megan remember grabbing the truck frame in a desperate attempt to resist her attacker she definitely wanted to leave some type of sign or some type of calling card if you will that this this she was there that this is taking place just in case she didn't make it out alive.
She also said the back end of the truck may have been dented.
Make it describes your Salem as a stocky blond man with facial hair about six feet tall with piercing blue eyes between his eyes with a crescent shape because when they construct him with the flashlight.
She kept her eyes open and she looked at his face and his body so she was able to discourage you know describe portions of the man then a reasonable stranger wouldn't know.
The rent six scientists measured and photographed the shoe and tire impressions outside the McKernan is home.
Several of the shoe impressions belonged to Megan's family but there were a number of unidentified shoe impressions presumably those of the assailant.
Boys corner where the assault took place.
Police found more tire impressions and scuff marks on the guard rail.
Boyd'S corner is an isolated area on an abandoned road leading to a cul de sac.
Because it was a gathering spot for teenagers police assume the assailant was a local matter familiar with the area.
The use of a weapon also suggested this wasn't his first crime.
We want to make sure that the person who did this to her wasn't out there hurting someone else so we want to make sure the community was aware of the information.
Police appealed to the community for help.
A newspaper article appeared three days after Megan's assaults asking if anyone recognized the description of the assailant orchestra.
That same day police received an anonymous telephone call.
An anonymous caller told police where they could find a truck similar to the one they were looking for in the make in the current an assault case.
We go to the address that was given to us by the anonymous caller there is the suspect vehicle it matches perfectly it's a blue Chevy truck with a black cap.
The truck was owned by Douglas Bailey this is detective Greene but we have a couple police immediately ran into problems.
Bailey didn't match the victim's physical description.
Your truck in the driveway yes Sir.
Police solve the Tweety bird air freshener the same one Megan had described hanging from the rear view mirror.
And behind the front seat was a rifle similar to the one the girls described.
They discovered prince on the frame by the passenger door.
By using a special adhesive strip.
They were found next to the passenger door and we're in a smear condition which would in my opinion indicated that someone had been forced into the vehicle or attempted to be forced into the vehicle.
Gloria then compared those prints to Megan's looking specifically for individual rich characteristics.
Known to different people have ever been found to have the same fingerprints that's based upon the individual rich characteristics the bifurcation the region being the enclosures the short regions which we find in a known fingerprint.
Megan'S fingerprints had the same rich characteristics and spacing as the fingerprints on the truck.
Those fingerprint impressions were made by the right index finger the right middle finger.
The right ring finger in the right little finger of Megan McKernan.
With the search warrant.
Police confiscated a pair of boots from the Bailey home to see if they matched footwear impressions found at the crime scene.
They can be like a fingerprint in so far as they can be individualized as having been made by a specific shoe to the exclusion of all others.
Florea says shoe soles develop tiny cops from stepping on objects such as glass or stones these accidental characteristics are unique to each shoes.
Using fingerprint dusting powder Florio covered the soul then used a sheet of adhesive tape and the roller to create a copy of that soul.
Next florea compared the size shape and accidental characteristics to the footwear impressions lifted from the crime scene.
They were a match.
Tires also have accidental characteristics like footwear.
When the tire impressions from the crime scene were compared to the baileys pickup truck tires they were found to be consistent.
There was a glove that was left at the scene the other match was inside the vehicle itself.
The shoes did not they belong to its twenty eight year old son ray who had recently been released from prison after serving seven years of a twenty five year sentence for burglary.
Doug Bailey wasn't surprised to hear his son might again be in trouble.
Craig Bailey was attending alcohol abuse recovery meetings at this local treatment center.
They came up to the detectives and such by the way cranks down at now call recovery service and if you want to go get him that's why is that.
And that's just where the police found him.
Without saying a word he turned around put his hands behind his back we hand cuffed him and took him out to the car he he never said a word and and never questioned us as to why we were there to take him into custody to me that was a sure sign of someone who had committed the crime or certainly was guilty of something.
And it wasn't long before police discovered that the anonymous callers with Craig's father died and his girlfriend.
Police suspect did twenty eight year old Craig Bailey a career criminal was the man who kidnapped and assaulted eighteen year old make in the current.
Megan'S description of her assailant Craig Bailey perfectly even the crescent shaped cut between his eyes.
Megan selected Craig Bailey out of a photo lineup of six people she did not hesitate when she selected the person that did this crime to our.
Doug Bailey told police that he and Craig were on their way to a movie when Craig stopped to speak with Megan and her sister in law Stephanie.
Later that night Craig dropped his father off at home and said he was going up to meet some friends his father had no idea his plan was to return to the girl's house.
Despite welcoming forensic evidence against him Craig Bailey refused to accept a plea bargain and pleaded not guilty at the preliminary hearing.
Meanwhile investigators work to strengthen their case against.
If I get a nice bright purple color change reaction that I know that I possibly have seen on that's what.
Which is what she found.
Also tested the samples with database tablets which react when coming into contact with amylase a digestive enzyme found in saliva.
What a faded based tablet is is basically a starch that is chemically connected to a di.
The test turned deep blue meaning saliva was press.
Those samples were subjected to a DQ alpha DNA test.
Test strips analyzed six specific locations on the DNA strands.
Frank Bailey's DNA matched the semen and saliva samples from the rate test.
Only one person out of three thousand people would have the DNA profile that we detected from the sword seaman on the five if all of those individuals have to be Caucasian.
There was a literal mountain of evidence to suggest and to prove that he in fact did commit the crimes.
Of felonious assault rape and kidnapping.
Megan'S blood inside the truck and fingerprints positioned in a way that clearly demonstrated she was forced into the vehicle all prove these points to the jury.
The forensics to this case.
Put the icing on the cake that allowed us to to conclusively link the suspect to the scene into the victim herself.
Craig Bailey was convicted of first degree kidnapping and rape and two counts of felonious assault.
He was sentenced to forty six years in prison.
Since Bailey was on parole when he committed the crime the judge reinstated the eighteen years remaining on Bailey's previous sentence.
We don't show any anger didn't show any remorse in Shawnee incredulity that I believe by the time he would get out would be.
Proximate Li eighty one years old.
If it wasn't for Meghan we might not have had a connection there could have been named dynamic attorney in there that would of.
Polluted the the issue of was it you know real crime you know these these girls asked him to come back or just enough to put a little bit of reasonable doubt don't mind of the jury so it was making her articulation and her conviction and her willingness to survive and make it through.
It'S not the case.
Federal investigators say everyone can learn from Megan McKernan this quick thinking and amazing recall.
Leave pieces and parts of whatever you can behind ripped clothing you know hair fingernails dig in have at it don't don't don't go away and leave us nothing because what we might find will be dis what's left over of.
