Well known doctor was brutally attacked in his home.
Investigators discovered the telephone traffic near the victim's home increased substantially within seconds of the crime.
Those calls contract with the sophisticated forensic computer program uncovered an international conspiracy.
Dr Louis Davidson was one of the most respected pediatricians in Saint Petersburg Florida.
Thirty eight years old he was head of pediatric emergency medicine at the bayfront Medical Center.
It was all about the patient the baby the toddler the child he treated MH.
With utmost respect.
Never a snide comments.
And he gave a hundred percent of himself to each child in his he was so smart he was almost scary.
On January twenty fifth nineteen ninety four doctor Davidson finished his work at the hospital and headed home to get some sleep.
Dr Davidson's girlfriend stop by his apartment later that day and this is what she saw.
She had a room key to the apartment she used a key to enter the apartment as she walked in she saw this crime scene were stuff was just spewed all over the place she walked back and found him in the top doctor Davidson was dead in the bathtub he had been beaten and apparently drowned I knew right away that this wasn't an ordinary suicide or anything like that this was definitely a brutal crime scene.
Detective Mike Salona was assigned to the case his identity is concealed because he's now working under cover.
The master bedroom closet had obviously been going through clothing pulled off hangers thrown on the floor however one of the items I was still in the closet was a comic back in in the bottom of the garment bag was twenty thousand dollars in cash.
Meaning the motive was robbery.
Rhyme scene had been staged to make it appear to be robbery.
Davidson'S girlfriend told police that the doctor had been receiving strange telephone calls at home over the past several weeks.
Sometimes they'll come at three in the morning sometimes phone warning she says that someone calls and then hangs up looking just to see if there was somebody home in that apartment.
Investigators found their first piece of forensic evidence on a tile floor in the doctor's apartment tile floors are very conducive to leaving evidence especially shoe prints.
Tile is flat and non porous perfect template for prince.
So technicians dust in the area.
And just as they expected a shoe impression appeared.
Next they use the gel pad and push the adhesive on to the print which fixes the dust in position for later analysis.
It was amazing to me that that shoe print was preserved normally that shoe print could have been destroyed in many different ways by detectives and officers and paramedics going in and out of that residence but some somehow that shoe prints survived.
The impression was sent to the F. B. I. in Washington DC to their footwear impression department.
There the print was compared to the thousands of shoe impressions on file.
FBI experts noticed it was a size nine sneakers and was new.
Their comparisons revealed it was a flight brand shoe a relatively obscure a brand.
But homicide investigators needed more than one shoe impression to find the killer.
Investigators were still processing the crime scene when news of Dr Davidson's death was released to the media.
It was on the.
And just the way he died.
Was so horrific that it was like.
Too hard to grasp.
It was like being in some bad movie but it was real.
Everything that people look for in a sort of a juicy almost a soap opera style story was was there in this particular market.
The doctors co workers could think of no one who would want to harm him.
But investigators discovered the doctor Davidson was going through a divorce.
His wife Denise a former finalist in the miss Jamaica beauty pageant was asking for custody of their eight year old daughter something the doctor was resisting.
When police told the niece that her husband had been murdered she appeared to have information that hadn't yet been released to the media here is Denise Davidson asking the detectives that telling her her husband was found murdered in his apartment well was it a robbery.
Now suspicious police place Denise Davidson under twenty four hour surveillance.
It was a pager she's called three days later Denise made an unusual trip she walks in and goes to a Western Union.
Obviously when she leaves we walk in right behind her.
She'S using Western Union and she sends a money transfer a twelve hundred dollar money transfer.
In the said Houston alias for the transfer lean white.
The money was sent to a Robert Gordon in Miami.
Fictitious address fictitious phone number.
Robert Gordon was an acquaintance of Miami night club owner Leo Cisneros who also happened to be Denise Davidson's current boyfriend and the father of her unborn child.
Cisneros allegedly had ties to Jamaican drug trafficking.
Like records indicated that Leo Cisneros flew to Jamaica on the day of Dr Davidson's merger.
And telephone records indicated that Denise Davidson made numerous calls to Robert Gordon on the morning her husband was murdered.
Between nine thirty in the morning and eleven thirty in the morning a two hour period.
There are fifty two telephone calls made from Denise Davidson's house.
To Robert Gordon's pager.
Investigators now believe that Denise Davidson knew more about her husband's murder thing she admitted and they asked the court for permission to wiretap per telephone.
That order was granted but it didn't reveal what investigators hope for.
Members Davidson from the beginning new better phones may be tapped so she was careful with what she said and what she didn't say on the phone.
While Leo Cisneros was in Jamaica.
Someone was using his cell phone in Florida and those calls could be easily traced.
When someone makes a cell phone call the signal goes through a series of what are known as cell site towers before it gets to an individual's phone.
Police can trace a cell phone call by the identity of the towers to call uses.
All of the cell tower in wiretap information is then put into the asus computer program.
Asus stands for augmented criminal investigations support system.
Basis and that ever been utilized by.
Least apartment for homicide investigations have been utilized for numerous years by the intelligence division by the narcotics division.
Because they deal a lot with telephone records wire taps large amounts of all the volumes of people connected to one another.
This computer analysis revealed an important piece of information.
Cisneros'S cell phone was used on the morning of Dr Davidson's murder from outside the doctor's apartment.
A few hours later calls were made from this motel near Dr Davidson's apartment and the calls continued while the individual headed south along highway six state route ninety five all the way to Miami.
The last call that day used a cell tower a few blocks away from Robert Gordon's home garden was the man Denise Davidson had wired twelve hundred dollars to a few days after the murder.
When police visited the motel near Dr Davidson's apart.
They discovered Robert Gordon had stayed there around that time the doctor Davidson's murder.
The main recalls that there was something left behind in that room one of their policies at the time was that there are items left behind by a customer they would put him in a bag with a car that had the date and the room number they were found and they put him in a storage closet.
The bag contained a sweatshirt and something investigators had been looking for since the day of the murder and guess what else we've got we've got some shoes sneakers to be exactly the same size as the impression found in the doctor's apartment.
Investigators hope this chance the Scot free would solve the murder.
Any statements and had wired money to Robert Gordon in Miami just days after her husband's murder.
Informants in Miami told police that Gordon had an associate Meryl mac Donald who was with garden in St Petersburg around the time of Dr Davidson's murder.
During questioning both denied any involvement in the crime.
They also denied owning the sweatshirt and sneakers left in their motel room.
Technicians compared the shoe impression found on Dr Davidson's tile floor with the sneakers from the motel.
Both the size nine both with the obscure avoid brand and both were identical in where patrons.
The shoes matched Gordon's shoe size.
Next technicians analyzed a sweatshirt and discovered a number of head hairs facial hairs and some foreign fibers.
The facial and head hairs were found inside the sweatshirt not uncommon when someone is taking the garment off over his head.
The hairs were unusual since they contain chemical dye.
A chemical analysis of that die match the dye found on the head and facial hair the second suspect Meryl McDonald.
Mr McDonnell made the mistake of coloring his hair the FBI lab was able to determine that the type of color used on this strand of hair was consistent with the type of coloring Mr macdonald uses on his hair.
Scientists also found blue cashmere fibers on the sweatshirt.
Finally and most damning DNA analysis of blood found on the sweatshirt and sneakers was that a doctor Davidson.
One more nail and put into the coffin of these two defendants these two men they were hired to kill that decided that money.
Was more important than life but investigators had no solid proof that Denise Davidson was involved in the murder plot.
She stood to inherit more than a half million dollars from her estranged husband's life insurance policy as well as gain full custody of their daughter.
During hours of police interrogation Denise insisted she didn't know Robert Gordon and Meryl McDonald and had nothing to do with their husband's murder.
Denise was under police surveillance when she went to the Western Union office to transfer money to Robert Gordon.
But she signed the receipt using an alias Pauline white.
Forensic handwriting examiner compared the Pauline white signature to known handwriting samples of Denise Davidson he concluded the same individuals signed them both.
The rain check technicians tested the receipts for latent or hidden fingerprints.
They stain the receipt within high trin chemical solution that turns the amino acids in finger oils.
We have a process for fingerprints and it's Denise Davis's fingerprints on that piece of paper.
Police found evidence that Denise Davidson purchased on man's gray sweatshirt and a pair of size nine sneakers just before her husband's murder identical to the items found in the motel with their husbands blood stains.
Denise Davidson not only denied any involvement in her husband's murder she now said she had evidence to prove that.
How much stranger in this case get.
And how many more twists in this case take.
The forensic evidence clearly placed Robert Gordon and Meryl McDonald inside Dr Davidson's apartment during his murder the two people that were hired to do the killing Mr Gordon and Mr McDonald didn't know the doctor at all.
The reason they took his life was strictly for monetary reasons.
But just as police were about to arrest the victim's estranged wife Denise the case took an unexpected turn.
Denise told police that the real killer had called her home while she was away and left a threatening message on her telephone answering machine.
But police arrested Denise anyway just as she was about to board a flight to Jamaica.
I approached her she sat there waiting for her flight to arrive she was very surprised when she saw me.
And the first words were detective Salona what are you doing here.
In October of nineteen ninety five the niece went on trial for soliciting her husband's murder.
Denise took the stand in her own defense and told the jury about the threatening telephone calls she received from the person she says was the real killer.
But prosecutors were ready for her.
Investigators have traced that call and discovered it had originated from the store where Denise worked in Denise had been under police surveillance that day I could see in her eyes she knew what was happening and it almost looked at that time like the air had just been taken out of prosecutors presented the jury with this surveillance video showing Denise entering the store shortly before the threatening call was placed and leaving just after the call was completed.
When the state attorney directed the question to her is to whether that was her voice on that tape.
She could only answer I don't think so she just listen to it and looked at it and really gave no explanation for who that phone call came from and why it was made she was holding up pretty good with her lies through the first portion of her testifying but from that point on.
Everything was falling apart and I think the jury saw what I saw and that was fear in the eyes.
Of the lady who hired two men to kill her husband.
Prosecutors believe that Denise asked her boyfriend Leo Cisneros killed her husband in Staunton Cisneros hired Robert Gordon and Meryl McDonnell.
S. as near as the boyfriend who had no courage she couldn't commit the crime himself so he hired the two scarecrows Robert Gordon Norman Donald he said didn't didn't have a brain amongst them.
The two track Dr Davidson for days by calling his apartment and the witness said they were at the hospital transplant doctors trying to get doctor Davidson scheduled.
On the day of the merger Dr Davidson was running two hours late and didn't arrive home until ten o'clock.
This explains why Denise called Robert Gordon's pager fifty two times between eight and ten o'clock that morning apparently concerned about why the merger was delayed.
When Gordon McDonald knocked on the doctor's door he answered in his bathroom.
After drowning Davidson in the bathtub Gordon left to shoe imprint on the tile floor.
And when the Donald removed the sweatshirt he left evidence of this dye colored head hairs.
For some unknown reason Gordon made the mistake of leaving the sneakers and sweat shirt behind at his motel.
A motel identified through Denise's telephone calls.
Prosecutors produced receipts showing Denise had sent Gordon and McDonald a total of fifteen thousand dollars.
After a two week trial.
Denise Davidson was found guilty of solicitation for murder she was sentenced to life in prison.
If I had one one line description of Denise Davis.
Which is a cold hearted bitch.
Robert Gordon and Meryl McDonald were tried and convicted of first degree murder they were both sentenced to death.
One of more glaring ironies of the case is that doctor Davidson through his alimony payments enabled his wife to hire a hit man who ultimately killed him.
Denise'S boyfriend Leo Cisneros who allegedly hired the hit man has not been captured he is believed to be in Jamaica or Venezuela.
Investigators say the mountain of forensic evidence against in these pains and unmistakable portrait of greed and premeditation.
A forensic technicians in this case to the excellent job they worked on this case tediously they were able to develop evidence that was not visible to the naked eye and because of their.
Indication they were able to use this evidence in court to gain a conviction one thing I learned from this case is if you're going to commit a crime.
