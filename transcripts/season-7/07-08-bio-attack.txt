In a small town in Oregon in nineteen eighty four the first biological attack was launched against the United States.
For over a decade the details of this nearly catastrophic event were withheld on the pump.
This is how forensic science on earth the biological trace.
This small town in Oregon it's called the daily and is perched high above the Columbia River about eighty miles east of.
It seems like you've driven back in the fifties.
I am Dave and sandy log cabins are among the eleven thousand residents who find the dales the perfect place to raise a family.
A half an hour an hour scheme a lot of water sports a lot of hiking has pretty decent schools we have pretty low crime.
On September twenty fifth nineteen eighty four David and sandy both became violently ill with cramps diarrhea and vomiting.
When David and his wife went to the hospital they weren't the only ones seriously ill.
And then suddenly there were so many people we have people laying on the floor we had people leaned up against the wall.
People in the lobby.
They all had a microbiologist identified the call.
Salmonella is a bacteria commonly found in eggs meat poultry unpasteurized milk water and animal feces especially that of ram.
It is rarely fatal but sometimes death occurs in infants and the cell.
Ten days after the first outbreak second wave.
The number of patients exploded from dozens to hundreds every hospital bed was still.
By the time they blocked consumers from four days of delirium he encountered a disaster likens owned a small restaurant thirteen of these employees were sick along with hundreds of its customers.
We had virtually no business manager despair it was tough I mean Elissa I was in the process of building another.
I was going to have it all paid for an opening up in debt free and it didn't work out that way.
But what was the source of the outbreak.
handlers who don't properly wash their hands after using the bathroom sometimes transmits.
Hundreds of people were sick and they hadn't eaten in the same restaurant or even the same restaurant chain.
Tested the water supply revealed nothing.
The centers for disease control in Atlanta Georgia was asked to investigate whether it was some type of accidental outbreak or was it.
Solving the riddle of the salmonella outbreak in our job that that would be me all the.
Scientists to study how disease moves through large populations.
They seem to be unrelated.
Complicated things greatly it was almost like doing multiple simultaneous investigations there seem to be no common link among the hundreds of residents were.
I think we were too sick to worry that much about it at that time it was later that we started you know wondering if it was going to close down.
Hundreds of their customers and most of their employees became ill.
At the county health department nurse Diane Kirk contacted everyone who fell ill and discovered they had all the sound from one to ten local restaurants.
And so what was going on they look at common suppliers of food they let you know where did everybody get their lettuce where did everybody get this card everybody get that we couldn't find one source of.
Cucumbers or lettuce or meat or anything that that would explain all those restaurants being contaminated it once.
Dr Michael skills runs the laboratory the process samples from the dales salmonella outbreak.
Microbiologist discovered that all of the victims have the same strain of salmonella one that was exceptionally rare.
And that's only the case for two percent of salmonella.
This woman ally had another characteristic on like most bacteria this one was not resistant to antibiotics.
When all the cases were tallied there have been seven hundred fifty one cases of salmonella poisoning.
Ten percent where restaurant workers.
The outbreak because my customers.
Never the less two months after the outbreak the state of Oregon reported that poor hygiene of restaurant workers and cross contamination for the most likely causes of the outbreak.
In other words they didn't.
The Oregon health department basically hung out said well it is your employees that you know was on safe practices unsafe handling of food.
Officials found no salmonella in Dade lock ins restaurant but they did find traces of it in some of the other restaurants.
If you work in public health long enough you'll figure out the last time you really can't pinpoint where things come from but health officials said this is the best we can tell you it wasn't a very satisfying explanation for them or for the public or from the press but at that time there was no other explanation.
Local officials now began to suspect a religious cult side of town.
The Russian as the Russian issues expanded their compound there is a growing tension between cult leaders and local politicians.
Just a year earlier one of the cult's leaders on on Sheila hinted at potential violence.
She said quote we are here in Oregon to stay at whatever the cost if that means some blood is spilled then this is the price we are prepared to pay.
From India Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh started the farming commune in nineteen eighty one.
After two years and thirty million dollars the sixty four thousand acre organic farming and meditation compound had its own post office school hospital and shopping mall with housing for over a thousand followers.
And our doctors and lawyers and accountants who've given up everything to drive tractors and plant potatoes and have no daily chance.
As he drove through the compound each day in one of the eighty rolls Royce automobiles the group preach the benefits of meditation where you live.
Published reports say that the bog one claimed to have had more sex partners than anyone in history.
In nineteen eighty two the Russian Nishi's took over the nearby town of.
And with that the majority of seats on the city council and school board which horrified long time residents of the small town.
The Russian the cheese had set their sights on control of the larger town of the dales and the put up their own slate of candidates running in the November election.
In the absence of the scientific explanation some thought the Russian nations might have intentionally poisoned the community in some way.
So there was suspicion but there was no evidence why would they do this.
And the other thought was maybe that was somebody some hot head trying to incriminate me.
One year later the Rajini she's behavior grew even more bizarre.
Revealing evidence that would eventually solve the mystery.
Health officials could not find the source of the salmonella outbreak in the dales are in discussion among local officials continued to be the Russian nation a religious cult living on a farm outside of town.
Leaders of the cult and town officials were often at odds.
The cold was founded by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh but the day to day operations were run by his associate ma non fiction.
And and the trade off was the bar won't say okay.
Your number one you're in control you take care of all the details I don't care how you do it.
The Russian machines were becoming paranoid for many reasons.
They were being investigated for possible immigration fraud and that was growing in terminal conflict between Sheila and other commune leaders.
She and her group.
For a power struggle with another group which I we always kind of called the Hollywood faction they were rich members of the call headed up by a lady who was the ex wife of a Hollywood producer they had money they had access to Rajneesh.
Sheila and her group were very paranoid about these people.
Former cult members told of plans to assassinate several local politicians rival cult members the United States attorney and journalist les sites in retaliation for some investigative pieces he had written about the group in the local newspaper.
One year after the salmonella outbreak without warning Sheila and the head of the Russian H. medical clinic a nurse named pooja played to your.
Prosecutors heard that pooja had been experimenting with biological poisons at the clinic including salmonella.
But there was no hard evidence.
With the increasing growth.
The bard one step up the level of personal security.
There were times when he would move from one end of the town to the other where he would be in a bullet proof limousine.
He would have a lead S. U. V. with armed guards and he would have a trailing SUV with armed guards internet have a jet ranger helicopter near.
We felt we could be confronted by forty five percent private armed with fully automatic weapons.
In October of nineteen ninety five a federal grand jury issued a thirty five page indictment charging the Baghlan with lying on his visa application and arranging sham marriages so his followers could remain in the United States.
When officials planned to search the compound they asked epidemiologist Dr Mike to come along because of fears of biological retaliation and as we were going up that road I was thinking you know for microbiologists this is going to be a pretty interesting day no shots were fired she.
In the commune licensed Medical Center steals found samples of various back.
Standard testing material for small.
One of these files contain salmonella.
And I remember the time thinking well they told me to look for salmonella by finding is with the season as evidenced well there it is so all season but I wasn't thinking at all that this was related to the outbreak.
Shortly after the race.
Russian issue left on one of his private jets he was arrested in North Carolina on the immigration charge.
Meanwhile the CDC tested the salmonella found in the communes lab using a technique called plasmid profiling.
Plasmids are sections of free floating genetic material outside the bacterial chromosome.
Bacteria can exchange plasmids allowing the company to genetically at that.
You would then use the size of the plasmid and some other characteristics of it to see whether it matched the plasmids from other bacteria mostly the size and so if you found that you had about the same plasmid type you could assume that these were related or similar strains.
The salmonella from the Russian the cheese clinic had a plasma profile similar to the organism from the dales.
And it could be killed by antibiotics just like the strain used in the event that.
That really was a smoking gun that showed us that the high school at that too I found in their clinic and the high schools that we were getting from the people in this outbreak really were the same bacterial strains.
The question remains why with the Russian the cheese plates and the residents of this small.
Inside the Russian you she commune investigators found evidence connecting the group to the mass salmonella poisoning.
And they discovered other bizarre activities.
Sheila had installed surveillance devices everywhere in the con.
Every pay phone in the town was.
And almost every building.
This is the largest.
Thousands of they had banks the paper calls on all the time.
it's it's it's the indescribable.
It was kept quiet by Sheila and her inner circle which held their meetings on her around bad.
The FBI also found a number of manuals for making bombs.
Doing dirty tricks and they found a number of articles about bioterrorism or bio warfare.
The salmonella was the weapon chosen for a power struggle but not and in turn one.
When the Russian you she's put up their own candidates to run for election for the local county commission they wanted to make sure their candidates one.
To do that they wanted to make the local borders second out so they couldn't get to the polling places to vote.
But why had the outbreak happened in September.
Informants say it was a rehearsal and it wasn't there for.
She lose direction the Rodney she took off their red robes and put on regular clothing and went through the town with freight containers filled with salmonella.
In August their first experiment was bringing the door handles in the county courthouse and produce given the local supermarket.
Their second experiment in September.
Ray Solomon aloe on salad bars in ten local restaurants which were contaminating over seven hundred residents.
Just before election day the Rajini she's made plans to contaminate the city's water.
Apparently they were unsuccessful.
There is evidence that someone had gotten to a reservoir for the food else gotten into it but no no I was actually or contaminants.
All of the Russian ishi candidates lost in the November elections.
Armed with the forensic biological evidence Sheila and pooja were extradited from Europe and charged with tampering with consumer products.
They both pled guilty served less than three years in federal prison were released went to Switzerland before state charges could be filed.
Last winter three levels and and you're running on they call one of the nursing home which is sort of chilling to think about turning grandma over to Sheila and her final days.
There was no proof of Russian nations self ever knew anything about the salmonella.
He pleaded guilty to immigration violations was deported and died in India in nineteen ninety.
Most of the restaurants targeted in the attack never recovered from the economic and went out of business.
We never regained the position we had in the community afterwards I had people that would tell me that you know I know wasn't her fault but I just can't eat there anymore.
He now runs a catering service.
The centers for disease control asked that it not be published hearing copycat crimes.
In nineteen ninety seven.
Thirteen years after the outbreak when bio terrorism have become a growing concern.
The paper was finally published in the journal of the American medical association.
Evidence discovered in the Russian cheese help clinic revealed they had even more biological weapons in their possession.
Itself would have been catastrophic.
