A young woman vanished from her home on an island in rural Canada.
Thousands of police army and local residents spent months searching for her this is the story of how one tiny white hair solve the mystery of her disappearance while adding a new chapter to the history of forensic science.
Prince Edward Island Canada's smallest province a twenty one hundred square mile vacation destination in the summer cold and desolate in the winter.
Father L. wa arsenal has ministered to the islanders for almost thirty years we're not used to it big violent things going on because people are very much down to right and everybody knows everyone because we're a small community it's not a very large population on the island you know.
On October seventh nineteen ninety four a woman called police to report an abandoned car in a field near her house.
The license plates were missing and when police looked inside they saw what looked to be a crime scene.
Bloodstains small specks of blood on the windshield on the inside of the windshield on the side windows of the vehicle inside.
These dots indicate the location of blood inside the car.
Forensic scientist identified the blood has medium impact blood spatter the type caused when someone is hit with an object like a fist.
The serial number of the vehicle identified the owner as a local woman thirty two year old surely do gay.
Surely was a stay at home mother of five children the oldest fifteen the youngest eight year old twin.
Early under children were living in this home now abandoned in the small town of Richman.
Her father Melvin had been watching the children sing surely disappeared four days earlier.
We found it very odd that no one had reported missing initially and of course of.
Raise some suspicion with us surely doing it had been known in the past to take off for a couple of days and not tell anyone where she had gone and then return.
Police suspected it was Charlie's blood in the car.
Hello she sat on while driving was found nearby so in blood.
She'S a very small diminutive person four feet nine inches tall less than a hundred pounds so very very frail looking individual.
That we didn't know too much about it.
To identify the blood scientists needed a blood sample from Charlie's father Melvin for DNA testing.
Sen surely would get half of our DNA from each parent scientists found that the blood in the car contained fifty percent of Melvin do gays genetic markers meaning the blood was surely while examining the blood forensic scientists found something else.
That did not come from surely do was this the blood of another victim.
After surely do gays car was found abandoned and spattered with blood the royal Canadian Mounted Police began one of the largest searches in the history of Prince Edward Island.
They checked hundreds of square miles and every water way in the area.
Anything that we could put our hands on think off we used to.
Some of the revelations were very unusual.
Psychics I've even told us that she was buried near water pine trees channel grave but where.
You just you just don't know where to start.
Respond to shuffle with two long black hairs attached.
When scientists compared that hair to hair taken from surely do gays hairbrush they were microscopically similar the search for Charlize body lasted for weeks then investigators came upon a possible clue.
Fifteen miles from Shirley's car police found a plastic bag with a pair of sneakers and the blood stained letter jacket inside.
The blood on the leather jacket matched surely do gays DNA profile.
But the jacket was a man sized much too big to belong to surely.
When police asked Melvin do you get a cool might have wanted to harm his daughter his response was startling.
I would kill them he was talking about sure Lee's estranged husband Doug Beamish a demolition worker who had been separated from surely for the past eighteen months.
I think I would do a good deed if I had a shot or killed.
Because she'd be alive today.
I'D be in jail that should be alive.
During the couple's on again off again fifteen year relationship police learned that Beamish had physically abused Charlie.
Every woman that lives sort of an abusive husband or boyfriend or whatever.
And end up murdered.
Hello reacting the same way.
But for some reason they do.
During police questioning Beamish denied any involvement in Charlie's disappearance where were you on the phone.
Then investigators asked him what size shoes he wore nine.
The same size as the sneakers found with the bloody leather jacket.
Now police wanted to know if Doug Beamish had worn the shoes so they turned to a forensic podiatrist Dr Keith battles.
Everyone wears shoes differently mostly because of the variations in size shape and mechanics of their feet.
Each individual has a unique way of walking this ultimately is transmitted to the soul of the feet which you gain is transmitted to the in the sole of the shoe and the game on to the outside of the issue as to whether walking to the where on that individual's shoe.
With a warrant police cast be emissions free by placing them in styrofoam mole.
Then poured plaster of Paris inside.
Molds can be compared to the wear patterns in a pair of shoes.
This computer generated image shows how these work patterns are created.
The different colors indicate the amount of pressure made by each part of the foot as it touches the inside of the shoe.
The feet create marks called pressure points and are unique to each person.
When Dr battles cut open the sneakers he found where patterns caused by pro needed feet and chafing marks in the top of the issue like those caused by hyper flex tones after I done the examination of the sneakers I was quite satisfied that the shoes have been worn at the time by Mr Beamish.
Doug Dinesh denied the sneakers were his he also denied owning the leather jacket found with the shoes.
Inside the jacket investigators discovered even more evidence twenty brittle white.
Under a microscope the hairs did not appear to be human.
The cord that runs through the center of the hair the shares at six dollars meaning they were animal hairs but what.
Constable Roger Savoy thought he had an answer he remembered something from this interview with Doug Beamish.
It was the type of observation we make hundreds of times each day but usually forget.
But it wasn't just any.
It was a your white.
Savoy also recalled that the cat rubbed up against his leg during his visit leaving a number of white hairs on his trousers.
Here'S the look identical to the ones found in the bloody leather jacket.
Investigators now wonder whether there was any way to prove scientifically whether if the cat hairs on the leather jacket belonging to snowball.
Thirty three year old surely gay was still missing but a leather jacket stained with her blood was found fifteen miles from her abandoned car police believe the leather jacket was the key to her disappearance.
The person involved in Shirley's death was likely wearing a jacket because it was not surely struck.
So we had to put the jacket on somebody we have to prove that a trackable on belong to someone.
Inside the jacket were several brittle white hairs which were suspected to be from the dog the mission is Capt.
And the job was to find someone that we could do this this type of testing.
Savoy made hundreds of telephone calls and found to his surprise that forensic testing on cat here had never been done before anywhere in the world D. N. A. testing.
But he was fortunate enough to come across Dr Stephen o'brien.
Another system the national Cancer Institute in the United States who'd spent decades studying hereditary illness in cats.
The constable said to be on the phone doctor o'brien I've looked all over the country in fact all over the world for an expert in cat D. N. A. technology because I would like very much to know whether or not the hairs that were in the lining of the jacket.
Which are tied to the scene of the crime because the jacket was covered with the victim's blood are those hairs from snowball.
Dr o'brien asked Canadian police for a blood sample from Mr Beamish is capped.
But this was more difficult than expected.
Snowball wasn't at all cooperative it took approximately half an hour from chase the cat from under the beds to every room in the house until it was almost like the cat knew that we were taking him in Roger Savoy told me he went down to the hosts and.
There'S an old saying what the SNP we always get our man but this case we had to go to say that we always get our cat.
After finally capturing the cat snowball was taken to a local veterinarian's office for the necessary blood sample.
Dr James Bond drew the blood as two Canadian officers stood by to take custody of the sample in order to preserve the chain of evidence.
Snowballs blonde and cat hairs taken from the leather jacket were delivered in person to doctoral Brian and his team.
One of the heroes contained a route which was cut into pieces and put into a buffer solution which dissolved everything except the DNA.
It was then amplified or photo copied so scientists had enough of their tests.
We got a very clear match between the genotype of each of the markers in the hair to each of the same markers in snowball in the only way that that could have happened is that they came from the same cat.
But Prince Edward Island is isolated and there are thousands of cats there.
Was it possible because of inbreeding isolation or just plain feline promiscuity that another cat on the island at the same genetic profile as snowball.
If so the DNA match would be useless.
You need to know that some other cat on Prince Edward Island couldn't have contributed that that here what if twenty five percent of the cats on Prince Edward Island has the same DNA profile or ten percent or even one hundred cats so that's the next question you have to ask what is the frequency of that profile.
Blood samples were taken from twenty cats on Prince Edward Island and sent to Doctorow Brian and his team.
The DNA profiles of these twenty catch showed a rich genetic diversity the chance that the cat here found on the leather jacket belong to a cat other than snowball was estimated to be one in seventeen minutes.
This was the break Canadian investigators had been hoping for.
And then after seven months of searching a fisherman found the last piece of evidence.
Twenty eight weeks into Charlie you gaze disappearance a fisherman along Canada's Anwar river saw a pile of brush on the river bank that looked out of place.
As he move the brush away he saw what appeared to be a human body.
It was a very shallow grave dug just deep enough to cover the body the person was a very tiny person we knew surely do get was less than five feet tall less than a hundred pounds obviously we were we expected it was surely do que I was alone by myself and it started to snow it was a freak snowstorm because and I recall all I had on was a rain jacket and I felt bad because the body was partly uncovered so I took my rain jacket which I was all I had to keep warm and put it on top of the great to keep the store for.
Ironically Shirley's body was buried in a spot nearly I tend to call to what the police psychic predicted.
Near the water under pine trees.
I was just lucky that they found when they did because the police told me that but then a.
Two or three weeks more and they would have had a hard time getting done fire because of the.
They knew that there was very little hope of finding her alive and when they found her they were very they were very relieved in the sense that they knew at least that they could have a service for her and pray and get together and if they could sort of bring a closure to.
The autopsy the cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma.
Just as the blood spatter in her car suggested Charlize nose was broken and her jaw broken in three places one of her front teeth was found dead in her long dark Beamish was arrested and charged with murder.
Scientists discovered that it was his blood mixed with surely he's inside her abandoned car.
But what was his motive.
Police discovered Beamish had written surely a letter threatening to kill her before he'd allow her to get custody of their children.
The whole letter was written in blood.
It was just one page minder.
But it was written in blood.
Police found this photograph taken the day before Shirley's disappearance.
In it he was wearing a jacket identical to the one found at the crime scene.
Well actually has no defense at all except to say I didn't do it.
But I think if he interviewed all of Persian origin of persons in Canada that also had didn't do it.
They'Ve already got someone else to blame on you know criminals to that they always blame someone else for the problems.
After going to great lengths to cover up the crime.
The mission never realized the petting his cat before the merger would be his downfall.
One in three criminals have cats and maybe one four have a dog so when you go to the scene of the crime and if there's a straits of DNA there it's like leaving your your name your rank and social security number which can be can be used and failing to have the individuals if they leave their pets parts there that can implicate them too this is what happened with Mr Beamish his pet cat implicated him.
Doug Beamish was tried and convicted of surely do gays murder and sentenced to eighteen years in prison.
The case is among the most celebrated in forensic history because it is the first time that animal DNA was used to convict the merger.
Since then we've received calls from after the investigation from all over the world but early I receive calls from Japan asking us how.
This worked out of the animal DNA work I mean I was actually surprised once the snowball case became well known among the friends a community I would say about once every two weeks I would receive a phone call from a a police department that was investigating a crime where a animal here had been left behind and they were asking us to help them.
T. S. Eliot hand these lines in his old possum's book of practical cats.
You now have learned enough to see the tax are much like you and me.
We'Ve learned that applies to their DNA to.
