In nineteen ninety three.
Five men were ambushed at work as they got out of their car.
One man was killed two others critically injured.
The gunman left behind a few spent shell casings but little else.
The rain six scientists would eventually find a clue in some straight men.
Revealing the history that someone had tried to erase.
Miguel row K. met his wife on a beach in their native Cuba the couple moved to Miami Florida in nineteen ninety one where they had their first child a daughter.
The gal was willing to work hard to get the good life.
In nineteen ninety three the talented mechanical engineer landed a job at the aircraft modular plant made airplane parts.
The one hundred sixty employees we're a tight knit group and the gal quickly became one of the family.
I was very impressed that he was here such a short time.
From his native country you know Cuba and and he knew how to speak English he was a go getter years ago that he knew what he wanted he was going.
The gal and four other employees were identified by management as having the potential for advancement so the company asked the man to attend computer classes at night.
The man all went to class together and formed a car pool.
October fourteenth nineteen ninety three was a night like any other.
After class the atmosphere was light and friendly.
Different things about working.
This is funny stuff.
When the car returned to the company parking lot the driver Hey Sanchez was the first one out don Samara was the second.
Someone started shooting.
Tomorrow was hit in the arm he immediately reached for his own gun.
Sanchez called under the car for cover tomorrow was hit again and ran towards the factory door ray Cruz was also hit another shot exploded through the windshield and hit me over okay sitting in the backseat.
Most owned a handgun and frantically tried to load it I started shooting up front and it's non jam.
Another one from the roof and hit me gal a second time.
Inside employees tried to help some more who is quickly losing blood.
At the same time that I was talking about the one ninety I turn around my gun.
Man so was almost a casualty luckily most that didn't pull the trigger.
Man so it was a night shift supervisor who heard the shooting and rushed to help.
When police and emergency crews arrived they first help break cruiser was outside and bleeding but still alive.
Dozens of Mara was unconscious Miguel rotate was still in the backseat and was pronounced dead at the scene.
The best thing that I have in my whole life.
Apparently the shots were fired from the roof of the factory.
They were spent shotgun shells but no sign of the gun or the gun.
Police searched the area by ground and air and they even shut down a nearby highway.
The gunman had made a clean getaway.
Investigators had two questions who would shoot five employees and what was the motive.
As police investigated the shooting of the five employees outside of the airplane factory they found evidence that the shooter had been on the factory roof and made his get away down a ladder in the back.
The shells found on the roof told investigators the weapon used was a shot done.
The shells were double ought buckshot shell contains nine pellets about the same size as a thirty two caliber bullet.
Take the shot nine times at once because each call it enters the body and and does a lot of damage.
The palate travels at about a thousand feet the second coming of the muzzle so it's like being shot nine times at once.
The shooting killed one man Miguel row K..
Douglas Samara and ray crews were alive but in critical condition.
Two others Jorge Sanchez and George Mousa escaped without injury I was angry because.
These are the people that I work with our dear my responsibility in somebody and hurt them and.
I was just knows my family but I was really angry I was I wanted to find shooter.
Police began their investigation by asking about any recent firings for disgruntled current employees.
One of the supervisors working on the night of the shooting reported seeing two or three man in a white Cadillac cruising the factory grounds this was particularly troubling since one of the shooting victims ray Cruz had a possible links to organized crime rate crews had a family member who is currently in a witness protection program.
testifying against major drug traffickers who had assassinated some government witnesses police wondered whether the factory shooting was a message to the Cruz family warning rate Cruz's brother not to testify at that trial.
As police started to investigate that theory a woman who lives directly behind the factory called to say she had found a gun in her yard.
Because of the police activity in the area shooting come outside she was fearful and it was something going on she should stay inside the next morning when she came outside of Peter Katz she noticed a shock on it she called police.
There were no fingerprints on the gun and the serial number had been filed off making it virtually impossible to trace that's what we call a robbery gone where it is easily concealable by removing part of the barrel and removing the stock from the weapon and it's easier to hide in a person.
To see if this was the gun used in the factory shooting Thomas court conducted a ballistic analysis.
Most diners have lands and grooves inside the gun barrel which leave distinctive marks on the books.
But the barrel of a shotgun is CMOS.
Without having a rifle bore there are no marks left behind on the appellants we can't identify the pallets we can only identify the shot chills themselves.
When a shot gun is fired.
The expanding gases forced to shell casings back against what is called the breech face of the gun.
That shot gun all the hallmarks and the primer of the shot shells over and over and over these marks will be the same so that's what we call the fingerprint of the weapon.
A microscopic comparison showed that the ballistic fingerprint of the sawed off shot gun matched the markings on the shelves found on the factory roof.
Although this was the murder weapon it wasn't the type used by organized crime it's been more up close and personal with hand guns so that they are sure that they hit their target their intended target.
Shocking as a good close up weapon from a long distance because of the way the projectile scatter you may not necessarily hit your target didn't appear to be the type of scenario where you have a person on a roof for the shock and.
Just didn't seem to fit.
The gun and shells with the only physical evidence investigators had.
But the guns still had a story to tell for those who knew how to read.
Place the chapel listing test had identified the gun used to kill me gal wrote K. and wound dogs and Mara and ray Cruz.
The question now was who owned the gun.
The serial number had been removed every mark the serial number the brand the model the gauge everything was ground off the weapon so we had no idea who the manufacturer was or any of the information model or serial number.
The first step was to determine the make and model of the gun.
The gun vault at the Miami Dade police crime lab holds over two thousand firearms of various makes and calipers experience firearms examiners thought it was probably a Remington model eight seventy shot gun so they compared it to the Remington eight seventy in their fault.
And sure enough it turned out to be a twelve gauge Remington pump shotgun they're they're fairly popular here M. FXR police officers carry.
The model eight seventy is popular everywhere it's one of the best selling shot guns ever made millions have been sold.
The killer knew the tracing sector gone without a serial number would be all but impossible.
But he didn't know what the crime laboratory can do.
By law all firearms sold in the United States must have the serial number stamped into the metal the number is recorded at the time of sale allowing any gun to be traced back to the original owner.
When they stamp a cell number in the weapon it compresses the metal of the weapon.
And it makes the metal underneath the serial numbers harder than the metal around and that's that's key for a seal number inspiration.
Smooth the area of the serial number with the center to create an even surface.
He then applied a strong asset to the steel the smooth surface ensures that the acid each the steel evenly but the area where the metal is compressed the area directly beneath the serial number that was removed is denser and resist the asset.
The next thing you'll see will be white ghost numbers of the cell number raising up through that metal.
With the recovery serial number detectives Coleman contacted the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms they said the manufacturer had sold the gun to a local sporting goods store.
So it's going to that store we obtain the ATF form that the purchaser filled out.
The name on the form was.
Man so it was a night shift supervisor at the airplane factory and was one of the first employees on the scene on the night of the shooting.
We also brought the form to our question document section or in our forensic lab the signature on both.
His work records and the form matched.
Investigators discovered that Mantsoe had been angry because others at work had been promoted ahead of him.
One of those promoted was don Samara a victim in the shooting.
And he thought that he deserved that position.
Unfortunately he didn't get it.
I believe it's because of his his lack of what not being able to communicate with vendors due to the fact they didn't speak any English.
That'S probably why I got the position now because I knew more than him.
But everyone believe Manso got over the disappointment since he didn't appear to harbor any lingering resentment.
As soon as all this happened the one person I turned to was was was Monson said also you have to help me out here with well everything that's going on and you know.
These gentlemen are in the hospital you have to take over so doing that week he was a person who is making sure the machines were running.
Haroldo man so denied he was involved in the shooting.
It was man sows closest friend Miguel Roque Kay who was killed in the shooting.
And man so had an alibi since he was seen in the factory immediately following the shooting.
But a background check revealed that man so had been a suspect in another shooting deaths the victim allegedly was having an affair with man so this wife.
Police now wondered whether this was a coincidence or a pattern of revenge and murder.
The murder weapon was a sawed off shotgun found in the yard of the women who live next to the factory.
After raising the serial number police discovered it was purchased by Karel doorman so.
And man so had an interesting background.
We ran your man so through that system and hit on a previous homicide.
On the side of Mr Guterres which currently in nineteen ninety one.
The victim Luis guti eras had been gunned down while in his car on a deserted stretch of road.
Despite a strong motive no physical evidence linked to man so to the merger although goody areas had been killed with a shotgun.
Police asked man so to come down to police headquarters for questioning.
After questioning him briefly detectives asked him to take a polygraph or lie detector test Manso consented Manso was asked if he knew who was responsible for the shooting.
And if he was the man who killed Miguel row K..
His answer of course is no he didn't know and no he didn't kill anybody.
It was clear deception indicated on the polygraph to those responses confronted with the polygraph results man so broke down and confessed but he said he missed his intended targets and instead killed his best friend Miguel row K..
And he told its actors and his confession that he was very upset that Mr okay died because he was not the intended target in fact he was the only friends that SO had in the business.
Indicated his targets for George Sanchez and George moose.
I think that he regretted that he didn't kill the right people.
Detectives also questioned band so about the shooting death of Luis guti eras.
He was yeah the year two years ago I killed my wife's lover too with the same gun he fired from inside his vehicle therefore the casing would remain inside his vehicle selling on that scene were projectiles from the shot gun which cannot be traced.
He was also charged with the attempted murder of the other four man in the parking lot.
Prosecutors believe that what motivated the shooting was resentment at being passed over for advancement.
As Manser did not speak English he was invited to go to the to the training session he saw this as a threat to his ability to go forward and his his occupation and so he resented the people that were going.
Especially resented his supervisor's George mosa and Jorge Sanchez for holding him back.
So after hours use the machinery at work to cut down the barrel of the shotgun.
And to grind off the serial number.
On the night of the shooting he snuck up to the roof with the easily concealed weapon and ambush the man he thought were in his way.
Although man so says that Sanchez and moves where his intended targets.
Since the shot gun instead of a rifle.
After the shooting he threw the gun off the roof into one of the arts near the factory then hurried down to the factory floor to create his alibi.
There'S a ladder that led to the top of the building this is curry down in the confusion he was able to ride out and end up here to be concerned now this will only take a couple of seconds.
When George mosasaur man so immediately after the shooting he had no idea at the time and so was the gunman.
I believe that Mr man so is is a dangerous man and he deals with his frustrations through violence this seems to be the only way you can resolve thanks to store lemony.
Haroldo man so was found guilty of murder and attempted murder and was sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison.
Can your okay shares keepsakes and memories of Mikhail with their daughter Lara.
Laura was just eighteen months old when her father died.
A father who worked long hours to give her a better life in America but never got to share it with her.
Sometimes I feel like I said by doing that I hopped on a small real I'm not here it was an odd life.
Doing many things.
To donate my mind any space to sing about.
Doug so Mara and ray Cruz survived their injuries dogs arm was almost amputated but doctors were able to save it.
The shooting change the victim's Doug's amora quit his job at the factory and went into law enforcement he now works as a corrections officer.
George Mousa impressed by the EMTs who responded to the shooting also quit his job and is training to become a medic.
Mansell believed that by scratching the serial number from his weapon.
He would remove all traces of ownership.
But forensic technology proved him wrong.
The more forensics the chief god of course the better it's going to be friends actually don't lie it's Sarah yeah then they don't really don't they don't make the kind of mistakes that witnesses may so it's really pretty exciting we link the casing so the gun the gun to the man's.
