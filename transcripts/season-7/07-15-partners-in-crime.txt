Firefighters who risked their lives to rescue a man from a burning building.
But they were too late.
The medical examiner found evidence that the victim suffered through more than the smoke and flames raced to send dead men tell no tales but nowadays that mental.
Around five o'clock in the morning on July sixteenth nineteen ninety two.
A motorist saw a house on fire in the residential area of Danville Illinois he ran to a nearby home for help I open the door his eyes were huge and it's a call nine one one.
Someone had opened the garage door and his car was gone so we at that time and thought well that he's not home that he's hopefully okay he's just out for breakfast.
We fought the fire it was quite tense came back out on the porch and then went back in again to to do some over on that's when we saw him.
It was the owner sixty eight year old Charles Lynch known as Jack to friends.
Although badly burned Lynch was identified through dental records.
I wish no one would have to see anything like that someone that has been burned to that degree is.
I don't know it it's it's hard to it's it's hard for us to explain.
Jack Lynch was a lifelong bachelor with no children but he treated the neighborhood children like his own.
There is always there for me when I was a kid so it was like he was there for my generation and he was there for my kids when they were young.
It was just part of my family.
Fit right in with the family.
One year when my daughter graduated from eighth grade I wish it didn't have much money he made sure that she got a dress for the area.
After the fire was extinguished investigators look for the call.
The fire started on the ground floor but in three separate areas it was ruled arson since fires don't start spontaneously in three different areas.
They found drawers pulled open mattresses overturned and signs of disarray.
Neighbors said Lynch was a fastidious man.
Also troubling was the discovery of tiny bits of rope near Lynch's body.
An indication he may have been found I don't think anybody was really guessing other than something apparently happened to me been tied up in any been burnt the fire.
Since there were no signs of forced entry it appeared that Lynch either knew his killer or had willingly let him inside.
But I hope and I pray to god are you for I think.
You know he he put on quite a display he acted emotionally upset.
He kept demanding to be let in the house he kept saying he wanted to see what was missing you want to see what happened and things like that.
A lot of attention to himself right off the bat.
This was Jack's neighbor ed crane was with lunch the night before and was the last known person to see him alive he's going over to Mr Lynch's house and talk to him and he turned around and he claimed that he borrowed some money from Mr legend and he left.
And he has had some from history past nothing.
We are extensive at that time that I can recall.
Because there's no forced entry into the home.
So that would make one think that either Mr Lynch allowed someone new to come in or was somebody from within so I don't Kramer was immediately a suspect.
Since the firing Jack Lynch's home started in three separate locations at the same time it didn't take fire investigators long to determine it was arson.
The last known person to see venture lives with his neighbor at.
We didn't work anywhere in the world alibi to speak up so and he was probably one of the many people we were focusing on.
Kramer denied having anything to do with Lynch's death or the fire.
When asked to take a polygraph test creamer and passed.
He was no longer considered a suspect.
Police found Jack Lynch's car a few blocks away from his home in this housing project parking lot.
Several other items were missing from ninety is home among them B. C. R. a microwave oven a video game unit and a three fifty seven magnum handgun.
Really sad he he died for what breed the cash the under under two hundred dollars cash well over a hundred dollars cash even though Jack Lynch's body was badly burned the autopsy told investigators how he died.
Surprisingly his lungs showed no signs of smoke inhalation.
There is no smoke in his lungs there was no such in his mouth so he did not inhale anything for hire.
Meaning Jack Lynch was dead before the fire started.
If you had died as a result of the fire the carbon dioxide levels would be anywhere from forty five to eighty five percent his level was right at four percent.
The medical examiner also discovered a number of stab wounds in the body the throat wound was the largest.
It was a cash and it was done with tremendous force that cut the jugular cut his larynx that was it was almost cut his neck in half.
The motive appeared to be robbery.
Just two weeks earlier there's been several robberies in the same neighborhood police wondered whether they were related.
A video store into nearby drugstores had been robbed at gunpoint and this home on nearby Griffin street had also been burglarized.
All of the crimes and the Lynch fire occurred within a half mile radius.
This man at least the distinctly that the perpetrator live or work close by.
Some of those are lazy as are the rest of us we were shopping we're looking for goods or services we tend to want to travel within a very close area around our home same thing applies to criminals I remember several murders I worked on some of the people live right across the street watched as workers seen all day.
Investigator Jack Smith had done some homework on these recent robberies and noticed two interesting coincidences.
First large numbers of prescription drugs were stolen during the drug store burglaries.
And secondly living directly in between Jack Lynch's home and the location of the home robbery on Griffin street was the home of Jamie and Robert Moore two well known drug dealers and addicts.
Yes we're both addicted to prescription painkillers no matter how much they had it it just wasn't enough to keep them going they both been using for a while and that was a big portion of their problem but a big dose of the selling of scripts selling of.
the prescription medicines on a hunch.
Jack Smith recommended that in the event of another robbery in the neighborhood the police consider Robert and Jamie Moore as possible suspects.
They didn't have to wait long.
Just hours after the fire a man and a woman entered a nearby motel with handguns took money from the front desk clerk and fled in a van.
The control officers responded to the call for them others respond directly to the more residents and just waited the van drove up to the Morris home and Jamie Moore stepped out.
The band all the way.
But the police stopped it just around the corner.
Dr Robert Moore.
What is your license right inside the van was the money from the hotel robbery.
Just before she was handcuffed Jamie swallowed a large number of pills and had to be rushed to the hospital.
Being guarded she attempted suicide in the bathroom broken light fixtures.
Police also found the three fifty seven magnum the more it's used in the hotel robbery.
Could it be the same gun stolen from Jack Lynch's home.
When police confiscated Robert and Jamie Morris fan they found the cash stolen from the hotel robbery and three fifty seven magnum pistols.
Where did you get it in his response was I got it out of the house the other day when I killed that guy.
my partner and I both just about fell out of our chairs you know because there's no way it's ever that easy.
In his paper confession Robert Moore said he went to Jack Lynch's home to rob him.
Once inside he over powered Lynch tied him with rope then ransacked the house.
Moore admitted he and Lynch for.
Moore said he stole what he could then set fire to the house to cover up the murder.
insisted he committed the crime alone.
No one else with with at any time when you did what you just talk about.
At the time of Robert Morris confession his wife Jamie was in the hospital recovering from her suicide attacks.
When she was able to speak she told police a different story than her husband.
Jamie claimed she knocked on Jack Lynch's store as a ruse so that her husband hiding nearby could get inside.
Pretty much range so she would go.
To make sure Mister Lynch was home.
And to get the door open and then her husband would come in and commit the robbery.
Jamie said she had no idea how Jack Lynch died because when she left she said Lynch was tied up on the sofa but was still alive.
But the forensic evidence contradicted Jamie's story as well as rock.
During Jack Lynch's autopsy the medical examiner found twenty four stab wounds.
But she also discovered something else they were all made with the same knife the wounds had been made by two different nights.
Both were approximately five inches long one had a long narrow blade the other was wider.
Killers seldom uses two different knives therefore the medical examiner concluded there were two killers.
It'S more likely that each of the two people that were there would have their own life and work and inflicting wounds on the victim individually.
In Lynch's kitchen was a burnt and scorched night pulled.
There were two large knives missing from that knife holder.
With the search warrant police discovered both of the missing knives and Robert and Jamie Morris bedroom behind the couple's bed covered with Jack Lynch's black.
The knights matched the wounds in Lynch's body in both size and shape.
So that in itself was one very big piece of evidence that we did have two knives that matched the rooms themselves I.
Personally I thought the Jamie.
I had something to do with it early a nationally because of the two knives Terry there may be a scenario where someone has two large knives and is using them to stab a person.
At the same time or they have one and they stand a person and then they later get a second knife and stab a person none of those really seem to make too much sense unfortunately there were no usable fingerprints on the nights so there was no physical evidence against Jamie.
Also in the Morris home police found dozens of empty prescription bottles many from the pharmacy robberies they also found the stolen goods from Lynch's home the Morris children were playing with Jack Lynch's video games I was in this crime was out of their league these people are not been involved in violent type crimes but they have been involved the last week ten days of a series of.
Escalating violent crimes involving weapons twenty thing was possible.
Prosecutors believe the use of two knives to kill Lynch meant that Jamie was not just Roberts partner in crime.
But also in merger.
Prosecutors believe that Robert and Jamie Moore walked the two blocks to Jack Lynch's home.
Jamie knocked on Lynch's door to gain entry Robert was hiding in the bushes J..
And once the door was opened Robert went inside.
To get a pound Lynch's hands and feet and look for items to steal.
At some point Lynch got free.
And the forensic evidence suggests that both stab Lynch repeatedly with two different nights twenty four times in all.
They loaded the stolen items in Lynch's car started the fire to cover the merger but made the mistake of setting the fires in three different locations a common sign of ours.
They also left behind remnants of the rope used to restrain Lynch.
The moors later abandoned Lynch's car a few blocks away.
Later that same day still desperate for money the couple robbed the comfort inn motel using the handgun stolen from Jack Lynch is home.
Although police had to confessions one from Robert Moore and the other from his wife Jamie they different in many respects.
But on the crucial question of who killed Jack Lynch they were consistent Robert insisted he alone killed Jack Lynch the forensic evidence contradicts that I think there was probably another part of his reasoning for wanting to take the blame myself so Jamie could be home with the kids while he went to the penitentiary he knew there was going to be sufficient evidence to link him up to the murder.
But I think he told the story that he could formulate best in his mind to keep his wife from going to jail.
In exchange for dropping the murder charge Jamie agreed to plead guilty to armed robbery and to testify against her husband it's not an easy thing for a person who agreed to testify against their spouse.
Especially when a spouse might be looking at the death penalty.
The night before she was to testify she attempted suicide once again.
I made the decision that I was not going to bring her into court.
And tried to force testimony out of her ID had no clue what she might really say when she got on the witness stand.
Although Jamie suicide attempt prevented her from testifying against Robert Moore one of Jack's close friends Kim are when did testify.
About the kind of man Jack Lynch was.
And she got the chance to look the accused killer in the ice.
He was in there when I was on the stand.
And he just had this look on in life there was no remorse whatsoever no kind of failing and as I walked off I looked at him like I hope they rot in hell for what he did.
Robert Moore never changed his story claiming that he alone killed Jack Lynch.
Moore was found guilty of murder but he escaped the death penalty and was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole.
The vote was eleven to one in favor of giving death but the one juror who stated he would not vote for death as I understand it indicated that he thought that Bob if if he were given life in prison that Bob could perhaps be rehabilitate.
Also feel more twin in there with the intent to kill Jack Lynch it got out of hand and went from there but what made it a felony murder was because involved home invasion robbery weapons and that made it the murder case.
And my kids.
My own family.
And I don't know if he realizes what he did.
But he'll never replaced or be able to justify to me why he did what he did or her.
For her part in these crimes Jamie Moore was sentenced to thirty nine years in prison.
The geographic profiling the determination that the crimes were related because of their proximity to one another and to the Morris home help solve the case.
People from out of town coming in and doing something leave it does happen from time to time but the vast majority of crimes are committed by.
