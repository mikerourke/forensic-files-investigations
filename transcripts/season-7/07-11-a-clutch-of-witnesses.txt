Hi witnesses said they saw a man in a pickup truck deliberately run over another man not once but twice.
Police could not find the victim's body for the pickup truck and when police tried to talk to the two eye witnesses they had disappeared to.
All police could find.
With some blood stains in the snow.
On January twenty ninth two thousand one a member of a motorcycle gang in Duluth Minnesota called police to report his roommate twenty seven year old Eric Sri for missing he said he hadn't seen Sri for for the last four days and he was worried usually that doesn't happen people that report missing persons usually call in within the first sixty eight hours in a panic.
For greater appreciate your assistance have a good day.
Officer Ryan temple was assigned to the case.
Attempted to contact all the area hospitals all the county jails in the area do you dilute detoxification center also tried to contact the victim's family his mother his father also his employer.
No one had heard from Eric Sri for he worked as an apprentice for the Boilermakers union six forty seven Eric was very quiet and reserved.
Very good performance on the job site.
But he hadn't been to work either.
Police found Sri first three automobiles still in his driveway his wallet and winter coats were inside his house.
Police discovered that Sri for was last seen at a party in a motorcycle clubhouse.
Two motorcycle club members who were at that party Charlie Johnson and her single said that Sri for got into an altercation with Joseph.
A member of a rival motorcycle club.
The two were separated and escorted outside.
The witnesses say women easily won the fight.
While Sri for was still on the ground Wakeman and did the unthinkable.
He got into his truck.
Started the engine and intentionally ran over Sri for.
Amazingly he wasn't killed.
Women and then put his truck in reverse and ran over him a second time.
Hearing for their own safety the witnesses ran back inside when they looked out again both the truck and Sri for we're gonna.
There was something more to the story than just a missing person.
The witnesses admitted they were drinking heavily that night and weren't sure of all the details and the alleged fight took place almost a week earlier and the inclement weather complicated the investigation.
There was a forty time lapse and we had received approximately eight inches of slushy snow in the in between time.
it made it very difficult crime scene there was once we got there there wasn't a whole lot to see to start with.
When police looked into Joseph women's background they discovered he had never been in trouble with the law he was an ex marine who had served during the Gulf War and was a member of the Thunderbird motorcycle gang although not an active member.
Investigators needed to find some forensic evidence to corroborate the witness's story.
Police wanted to find some way to verify the claims of two eye witnesses that Eric Sri for was run over twice by Joseph women and in his truck from the very beginning we had to try and put the case together to understand exactly what happened and then attempt to try and locate where possible the body had gone to after that period of time so initially were trying to put the puzzle together before the final where the body may have gone to.
Police set up a command post in the alley where the fight allegedly took place.
Working in subzero temperatures officers on covered the top layer of new snow in order to search for blood.
They were successful.
They discovered a blood trail that led from the alley all the way to the end of the parking area nearly eighty yards away.
At the end of the trail police found one very large pool of blood in the snow.
Due to the amount of blood that we found in that one spot in the fact that there was no blood after that as we continue to excavate the snow past that point we believe the body was loaded into the truck.
Medical examiner Dr Donald com dole was called to the scene.
Person to produce that much blood in one localized area had to still have their heart beating.
They may have suffered serious injuries but their heart had to steer still be beating in order to produce that much blood coming from a woman.
Once the heart stops beating a body no longer believes.
The blood evidence suggested that the victim was lodged under the truck.
And was dragged eighty yards.
The pool of blood at the end of the trail indicated the victim was still alive and it's been picked up from the snow.
However Dr Khan told told police that without immediate medical attention the victim would have died within four hours.
To collect the blood evidence police used a standard coffee filter to separate the blood from the snow.
The filter traps the red and white blood cells and allowed plasma and melting snow to drift through.
Just as the filter traps coffee grounds not allowing them to drip into the coffee.
Without a body.
He'S had another problem how to tell whether this was the blood of Eric Sri for but police got a break.
They learned that Sri for had undergone hand surgery a few years earlier when he had accidentally shot himself.
The hospital shade tree first tissue sample that had been sent to the pathology lab for analysis.
The tissue was preserved in paraffin which holds the degenerative process preserving the tissues indefinitely.
The blood DNA found in the snow was compared to the DNA from three first tissue samples get matched.
Police campus area hospitals health clinics and doctors offices no one with the type of injury Sri for would have sustained had been treated.
Convinced that Eric Sri for could not have survived without treatment the medical examiner signed a death certificate.
Yes we do have a homicide and one of the worst types.
For a detective to have homicide without a body.
The next step was for police to speak with the driver of the truck Joseph Whelan but he was uncooperative he started to shut the door on at that point I reached over and grabbed him by the shirt informed him that he was under arrest for murder.
Police impounded women's vehicles.
But a forensic analysis found no evidence of an accident.
They found no trace of blood body fluids or hair anywhere on the truck or underneath.
Crime lab is well respected by law enforcement agencies in the state they've got the best equipment more sophisticated gear if they couldn't find any evidence in the truck and then you start wondering well how could that be how could somebody drive a truck over somebody twice and has no hair no blood nothing and that didn't seem right to me.
The lack of forensic evidence wasn't the only problem.
Witness'S credibility was another.
During police questioning both witnesses admitted they were in the pre dated at the time of the alleged accident.
One said quote I don't remember who was at the house who came back we were sitting there drinking I know there was people in and out like I say I'm drunk I stayed drunk as I can.
And Joseph Lehman and maintained his innocence.
Prosecutors knew they didn't have enough evidence to go to trial.
Investigators needed more evidence in the Eric Sri for case and the search for his body intensified.
Police decided to find out how old their prime suspect Joseph women and spent his leisure time and with home.
I came across one of his friends and asked when's the last time you spent time with women and where was that that he spent the time with them and it came to be that within the week previous he was ice fishing with this friend.
Police had a general description of the ice house at women and his friend to use but they weren't sure where it was located on the bass St Louis river.
Never the less police were assigned to search the area.
He came across a nice house weren't quite sure what that was the one that we are necessarily looking for but as he was looking into his house he found a hole that was larger than your normal ice fishing all probably the size of one that a human could be slipped into.
An underwater dive team searched the frigid waters of the St Louis river for Sri first body.
Conditions were miserable it was snowing with wind gusts up to thirty miles per hour divers could stay under the freezing water for only thirty to forty five minutes before suffering hypothermia.
After days of searching they found nothing.
Then investigators got more bad news their case against women was based almost entirely on the testimony of two witnesses who claimed they saw a fight between Sri for and women.
But when police want to question them further the two had vanished we have actually documented testimony from family members of the two witnesses that the Thunderbirds were approached by the hell's angels and in turn approached the two witnesses and asked them to leave the community.
With nobody no forensic evidence against women and and now no witnesses the defense filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The prosecution was in a difficult position.
All the while to we're looking for the body and we're looking for some more physical evidence to tie Joe women into this we were convinced that he was the person responsible for the death but he wasn't saying anything.
The more police thought about women and struck in the eye witness testimony the more they realized how unlikely it was that the undercarriage of the strike would be so please especially in the middle of winter.
In the words of investigators it was almost too please.
So nearly six months after the murder they examine the truck once again.
We decided we would take the truck apart piece by piece.
Until we were satisfied that there was no evidence to be found.
We actually found evidence and that's what we did we had a belief all along that.
if the truck was used in transport of the body.
there always has to be some type of forensic evidence left behind or or in any kind of crime scene I am but I strongly believe that there's always friend sick evidence that's left behind in any crime scene.
I think I used the analogy in one of my stories it was like they were cutting their lawn with tweezers they went over that vehicle inch by inch.
For over two days police searched every inch of the vehicles.
On their first piece of evidence a single strand of human hair that was attached to the front spring of the truck.
And when they removed the covering of the trucks cargo area they found several small blood stains in the crevices.
Police now suspected that women in power sprayed his truck after the merger and the water pushed the victim's blood into the tiny crevices between the sheets of metal.
But scientists still needed to find out who the blood and hair belonged to.
When police found blood stains and a strand of hair in the undercarriage of Joseph waiting instruct they promptly inform the way millions of tourney that they would be sending the materials for forensic testing.
Once the state could tie of the body to Mr women instruct the case I changed dramatically and I talked to John I I and I told him so ultimately it comes down to the Kenny Rogers song you gotta know when to hold em and know when to fold and I felt it was when they found that blood in the truck it was time to fold.
Without even waiting for the results of the forensic testing Wakeman and the greed to lead police to Sri for his body in return for a reduced charge of unintentional second degree murder.
The prosecution agreed and women and confessed it's my opinion that this forensic evidence was so powerful.
Mr women knew what the outcome would be when we sent it to the lab.
And just decided to plead guilty.
I was shocked I do all of this was going to come on.
I was angry with.
Wakeman and admitted running over Sri for in the alley but said it was an accident.
He also said he didn't realize Schriever was stuck under the truck until you reach the end of the parking lot.
Women and said he put you first in the back of his truck and dumped him into the river the next day.
He said the police had searched the correct spot in the Saint Louis river but the body may have drifted.
When the divers returned for a second search they still couldn't find the body.
A few weeks later after the plea agreement was signed Sri first bodies surfaced by itself on the Wisconsin side of the river.
The autopsy revealed that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.
In women's mother's garage police found a cinder block its size and shape are consistent with three for his head injury.
Women didn't deny striking Sri for in the head with the block but said he did it after Sri for was already dead.
Prosecutors were skeptical he says he hit him with a block when he was wrapping up his body and his mother's garage and hit him with a block of cement just out of frustration expressing anger at Eric Sri for for having caused him to do this doesn't make a lot of sense.
Because of the plea agreement Joseph way man and was sentenced to twelve and a half years in prison for Eric Sri for staff.
He'Ll be eligible for parole after eight years.
Twelve years in prison for a murder were you drive your vehicle over a body one time then back over again if the witnesses are to both be believed to me that's not justice.
The family wanted us to make some type of negotiation compromise on the amount of time.
And in return for recovery of the body I remember even telling Eric's mom and dad.
That show women in is not going to get what he deserves for what he did to Eric.
I made that very clear to them and that's what I even told the court at sentencing.
But we were willing to make a compromise in order to recover the body put the case behind.
The other reason for the deal was the disappearance of the two eyewitnesses they are still missing to this day.
I hope they're okay nothing has happened to them and if we can find out who is responsible for their disappearance.
For there being conveniently absent at a time when we needed them.
For us having to reduce a charge for murder in the second re intentional murder down unintentional we want to know then they'll be a little bit of finally to this case.
The case was solved by forensic evidence wait a minute could power wash away.
Wait on the news that the blood found in the metal crevices and the single strand of hair were Sri furries and that forensic testing would prove it I strongly believe that there's always frantic evidence that's left behind in the crime scene it's just a matter of you humanize picking up and looking in certain places and using the current technologies to locate that forensic evidence forensic science was remarkable because without the police department going that extra distance and finding that evidence in the trunk of the tailgate and the undercarriage without the medical examiner finding that blood sample with the matching DNA at the end of that alley.
