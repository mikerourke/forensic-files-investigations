Some time after midnight in July of nineteen eighty six Stephanie brown some friends home who lived in a familiar.
Make sure you go I. five north don't go south.
Get back to work brown was told to take interstate five north a major thoroughfare in California.
Hi five north.
Despite the directions Stephanie brown made the wrong turn.
It took both science and psychology to discover what happened.
The fisherman walking down this trail in a remote mountain area outside of Sacramento California discovered the semi nude body of a young woman lying face down in a flood and irrigation ditch.
Around her neck a band of purple discoloration the sign of ligature strangulation is very isolated desolate.
You'Re right next to a corn field and there were no houses or lights civilization anywhere around it's a very lonely spot to have been driven to and certain she was conscious during the drive we don't know how long he toyed with her we don't know how long he assaulted or how long it was before she was killed.
The autopsy found traces of semen but the samples were too badly degraded for DNA testing the victim was identified as nineteen year old Stephanie brown who worked as a teller in a Sacramento bank Stephanie was a very sensitive loving.
Caring daughter who wouldn't hurt anybody.
Monday after work she came by and did laundry she called a couple of friends on the phone.
And then when she was thrown.
She came off.
Give us a kiss goodbye.
And I just remember her walking.
Of the family room out the door waving in our hair in a pony tail.
My mom I love you.
When police learned that Stephanie's hair was long and detailed the day before she died they realize that her killer had cut.
Ray Biondi headed Sacramento's homicide unit first thought came to my mind is we're dealing with somebody with a very perverse fetish cutting hair.
and I have never seen this before and hundreds of other murder investigations.
Did this person cut to hair and take it away as a trophy or a souvenir we didn't really know.
The car was found twenty miles away on interstate five and was headed in the opposite direction from her apartment the card is full of gas and operation brown was probably lost and they have stopped to ask someone for directions.
Just one month later there was another incident along interstate five twenty six year old Charmaine Sabra and her mother had been out to dinner and we're heading home when their car broke down along the deserted stretch of interstate five.
A man in a dark sports cars stopped and offered help eighty seven trouble with your car I heard a noise.
That was the last time her mother saw her.
In the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains outside of Sacramento California a hunter discovered the badly decomposed remains of a white female.
The remains have been scattered by animals but investigators recovered the skull torso and some clothing which included a purple skirt dark blouse and a pair of alligator heels shoes the clothes were similar to those worn by Charmaine Sabra who disappeared without a trace after accepting a ride three months earlier on interstate five.
Dental X. rays confirmed that the remains were those of Charmaine Sabra.
The cause of death was strangulation the site seen from Charmaine's blouse was cut and used as a ligature around her neck along with a piece of yellow nylon cord.
panty hose had been cut in two places and tied around her wrist.
Analysts Jim Streeter analyzed the clothing from the crime scene I've never sailed close getting like that I've never seen any cutting like that talking with the investigators they've never seen any types of cutting like this cuttings would be.
For some function in any other case we.
It seems that in this particular case is so unusual that it became his calling card the initial cutting is what he uses to arouse himself and usually sexually and then.
L. enables him to complete and perform the rest of the of the offense.
Like Stephanie brown Charmaine Sabra's body was found over fifty miles away from where her car broke down on interstate five Charmaine's mother was not able to provide a detailed description of the driver since she did not see him clearly all she could say was that he was a white male in his forties with a large nose and pale skin it's hard to imagine that he would take Charmaine planning to kill her knowing that he left his mother her mother as a witness fine and makes no sense to me.
Bruce Henderson described sophistication of the serial killer in this book trace evidence.
Very good coun founding the please this killer didn't leave behind easy clues and he took his victims great distances and he left clean crime scenes meaning no fingerprints or anything that could connect him to the crime or to the victim.
Two weeks later police were called to another homicide thirty five miles southeast of Sacramento.
halter top and socks had been caught in the same non functional way as the other victims dental records identified the remains as twenty year old Laura heating.
The last time anyone saw her was in an area frequented by prostitutes.
They needed money for drugs and Driggers told police that Lara agreed to prostitution.
Laura left for the customer in a white car.
Record setting never saw her again.
But Driggers took a lie detector test and failed is it the boyfriend or is it not the boyfriend the first people mess lemonade of those all around the victim.
Police were convinced that the murders were all related.
Drinkers had a hand in his girlfriend's murder what was his connection to the other victims.
A serial murderer was on the loose in central California at first up ducting women along interstate five and later probably for prostitutes in downtown Sacramento police decoy is dressed as prostitutes in an attempt to lure the killer into their trap and they also posed as a motorist in distress along interstate five.
Despite these efforts the mergers continue.
On Sunday June twenty first nineteen eighty seven in the remote woods of Deer Creek Amador county a family on a hiking trip found blood on the trail the victim was identified as twenty five year old Karen finch she was divorced and the mother of the two year old daughter the car was found near interstate five fully operational for sandals were still in the car if she walked barefoot she hadn't planned to walk far.
There was a piece of.
Which light bulbs went on to time thank them this is what happened is Stephanie brown case that's why your hair was cut.
The killer you take cash and cut it off before leaving the scene you may have known the sticky side gate is a rich source of.
But this time.
The killer left the scene without removing all of the tape unfortunately there were no fingerprints on the piece of tape you left behind the bodies were found some distance from where he would have been able to park his vehicle some of these distances were too far that he would have carried them so we're certain that they were made to walk they may have had their hands bound at that time.
A few weeks later police had yet another victim the new decomposed body of seventeen year old Darcy Franken poll was found in a deserted area off highway fifty near Lake Tahoe six the cause of death was strangulation or blouse was tied around her neck with the wood garage two pieces of rope were found near her clothing the road was made of nylon and after checking with several rope suppliers police discovered that it was the type of rope used in parachute cords cutting the victim's clothing was important to the killer for some reason it's so important that he did this in all of these mergers so important he would carry a pair of scissors to every line to carry out the ritual.
I cried for all the victims it was just so emotional after a year and a half of working on all this physical evidence trying to wink everyone together and trying to find the person that did this so that wouldn't happen again and just be overwhelming at times.
The killer was experienced he knew exactly what he was doing and he perfected his technique with every case.
The only lead police had in their search for the serial killer was the way in which he carried out the murders his signature characteristics included the rope and the clothes cutting.
A few months later an unrelated incident caught homicides attention.
Deborah Guffey was a street prostitute in downtown Sacramento told police an interesting story are you working today.
When you park the car he turned violent.
Smashing his head into the.
Got the managed to escape.
A policeman was driving nearby saw the altercation and stopped to investigate.
Forty eight year old Roger Kinney was charged with the assault he was the manager of the public storage facility married and had a daughter from an earlier marriage.
Background check on Roger can be revealed an arrest thirty years earlier at the age of fifteen for stealing women's underwear off their clothes lines and cutting it in a random non functional way with a pair of these mothers sisters kibbe told police at the time he had a terrible relationship with his mother.
Roger can be was also a parachutist another coincidence since parachute rope had been found at one of the murder site.
Another coincidence since police suspected that the killer new homicide investigative techniques Roger can be owned two different cars one was similar in the car which picked up Charmaine Sabra in the other police found some rope with the garage tied to the ends a set of handcuffs and since we knew who our killer was it was Roger can.
But we lacked evidence to actually file any case in the murder charges against him.
Criminalist face Springer is an expert in exchange for trace evidence that could link the suspect or victim to a crime scene.
Springer poring over the thousands of hairs fibers and other materials found on the victim's clothes.
She found to carpet fibers on Darcy Frank hold stress they were blue triangular in shape made of nylon and were manufactured by the dupont company when she compared the fibers to the carpet and Roger Cabey's automobile she discovered that they were the same color size shape made of the same polymer and died with the same chemicals and when Springer look closer.
She saw something else on the fibers I noticed when I was looking at the fibers microscopically that there were some contaminants on the surface it was a football shaped particle that turned out later to be identified as a fungal spore the scene fungal spores run the fibers from the floor mat of kiddies car.
The human hair found on one of the victims dress was microscopically similar to hair taken from Roger QB's inner thoughts.
When Springer turned her attention to the panty hose used to tie Charmaine Sabra's wrists she noticed something which had previously been overlooked benefit of being a woman Cornelissen working sexual assault type homicides is that we know that time off inside out man just wouldn't know that unless they actually had panty hose on.
With the panty hose turn the proper way Springer discovered several small fibers on the back of the leg area when Springer compared those fibers to the fibers on the seat of one of Roger Cabey's automobiles they were microscopically similar final spring analyzed the pieces of rope found in kid these car and in his storage shed.
At first glance it appeared to be identical to the rope found near Darcy Franken polls by both were made of white nylon six fibers running through the cord and thirty two threads per core but face Springer noticed something peculiar when she looked at the ropes under the microscope I noticed that there was red paint on the cordage and some black particles later came also be said that she had some cordage from an assault case that can be was involved in she brought that out I looked at it I noticed the same particles were on that cordage this was a very strong link to all Roger QB and all Darcy fracking Paul.
The size of the paint particles was fine about six microns which is six millions of the meter.
With the scanning electron microscope scientists performed an elemental analysis of the inorganic compounds of the pain they found ten different elements in the paint mixture common in the chemical formulation of red acrylic paint but they found two additional elements in the paint which were not sodium and chlorine these were contaminants in the air when the paint was sprayed near the road.
All three pieces of rope at the same red paint and the same contaminants.
The real town near Darcy Franken post body the real sound Roger to these car and into the storage shed all were in the same area when someone was using a can of red acrylic spray paint.
Cordage was basically the couldn't rob people's case it was extremely unique commonality was the red paint stains on each one of these chords those three scenes which meant Roger Kinney.
Was at the scene said he's boxed in ladies and gentlemen we're going to bury and he's guilty.
Roger QB was charged with the murder of Darcy Franken.
On March eighteenth nineteen ninety one he was found guilty of murder in the first degree and was sentenced to twenty five years to life can be still faces the possibility of murder charges in the other day.
Roger is in prison for only one murder.
There has to be another trial.
These are the families need to see some kind of reconciliation in court the police and prosecution were unaware that can be passed to his wife shortly after his arrest and I didn't know that he had murdered anybody until that night please arrange for me to get in the backseat and occurs in.
And he told me.
That he had killed.
Five people well for skews me for.
I cried she cried.
I asked him why.
I mean we were sobbing.
He said he didn't know.
I came away from there.
Just feeling and overcoming with the thought that this is not.
This just is not enough my daughter is laying there and so are many many other girls.
And this man all he can say what is the fuss.
