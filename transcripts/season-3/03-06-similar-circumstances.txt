Well after working the night shift Robert Sims returned home and found his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor.
To his release their two year old son Randy was asleep undisturbed and upstairs bedroom.
But their six week old daughter heather was missing.
When she regained consciousness Paula Simons was the only witness to a crime that baffles investigators to this day.
Robert and Paul as Sam's had recently moved into this frame home in the St Louis suburb of Alton Illinois.
Neighbors described the Sims as a quiet and private couple who spent most of their free time with their children they really seem to be living the American dream that was one of the things that was so intriguing about the story to have this kind of violence is kind of tragedy visited on such and all American couple that was what really turned the story for us at the beginning.
When police were called the Sims on April nineteenth nineteen eighty nine.
Caller said she was taking out the trash just after ten PM when a masked man armed with the gun forced her back inside the house.
And knocked her unconscious with a blow to the back of her head.
That was the last thing she remembered before her house founder on the floor forty five minutes later.
Their infant daughter heather was missing but the area around the bassinet was on the stairs.
Police could find no foreign fingerprints or footprints and no valuables were missing we stayed there at the scene it seems like forever I know we were there for a good half day we looked everywhere every conceivable place where that child might.
Fuming the worst police also searched the bottom of the Mississippi River near the Sam's home we had asked Mr Mrs Ms if they had any enemies that that for whatever reason might want to still the baby in order to punish them in some way in and they were pretty adamant that they didn't have any body that they would suspect of doing that a neighbor reported seeing a suspicious character walking near the Sam's home another informant saw an individual burying something that night behind a nearby factory.
All of the leads were dead ends police had little to go on and no motive.
Seldom does anybody take a baby.
Just to be taking it is usually a ransom demand which we had none we found no evidence that there was any extramarital problem any involvement of a of a boyfriend who might suspect he's the real father of the child and he wanted his child we can find anything that would explain why someone would target the Sims is for kidnapping.
Four days later Charles Saunders was fishing on the Missouri side of the Mississippi River.
Around noon as Saunders was about to leave he stopped to empty some trash into a barrel.
Inside he noticed a large black garbage bag.
Because of its size it looks suspicious.
Inside he discovered the well preserved remains of a dead baby girl.
I'M a site investigators converged on the parking lot with the body of the baby girl was found in a garbage can my order back face.
Hand and foot prints from the dead baby were compared to the prince of heather's seems taken at the hospital just after she was born.
The body was positively identified as heavier Leeson's.
Medical examiner Dr merry case performed the autopsy one of the first thing she noticed three small vertical cuts on the inside of the baby's lip obviously this is not for example a sudden infant death which is a natural death it's not a death by accident it's not a death by suicide so it's a homicidal death and when I begin the examination there is no gunshot wound there's no stab wound there's no battery and the inner lip showed changes that I associated with someone placing their hand over the nose and mouth and causing suffocation when death occurs blood settles in parts of the body closest to the ground this is called postmortem lividity and is usually dark red or purple in color.
Heather'S face showed signs of lividity box it was cherry red in color.
Dr case that the body had been placed in the freezer during that time the better D. occurs eight to twelve hours after death and there was another clue the body had been frozen the external appearance was that there was no decomposition when I looked internally then gotten then I even had to look microscopically at those internal organs to see this but there was early decomposition beginning but it was a little bit more advanced than externally Dr case concluded that heather Simmons had been suffocated placed in a freezer face down then placed in the trash bin they stopped there the night before or the morning the body was discovered.
Assistant state's attorney don Weber was keeping a close eye on this case there was no evidence linking Paula or Roberts and for the crime but Weber decided to take a closer look at their store.
He made the statement to the FBI that during the time that heather was reported missing at the time she was found that they had had the longest and longest lasting and best sex that they never had.
and that is such a startling statement to me I couldn't I don't believe the other people involved in the case could really I think that would be a normal response after baby was kidnapped.
And when authorities look into the couple's past they found an alarming coincidence.
At heather's seems funeral Robert and Paula Sims looked every bit the grieving parents to the outside world.
But the background check revealed the Sims had experienced another kidnapping.
Three years earlier while living in another town the Sims first daughter Lorelai had also been kidnapped it was the same scenario Robert was at work and Paula said a masked intruder confronted her in the house and kidnapped her baby a few weeks later.
The infant skeletal remains were found scattered in a field behind the Sam's home although authorities had their suspicions at the time they could find no evidence linking Robert or Paula Sims the Lora alliance merger the remains appear to have been moved by some type of animal the call to the Rick remains were of such that.
The investigation.
Could not be put together as far as making a case of murder the Sims is themselves became even stronger suspects after that and in in my opinion is that they got away with murder.
But in the case of heather sept option there was something about Palmer's head injury that didn't sound right the prosecutor.
So Webber paid a visit to the medical examiner Dr merry case who had a unique background she was not only the path colleges to perform heather's seems autopsy she was also a board certified neuropathy is an expert in the study of the brain and nervous system.
Wallace says that she saw the guy outside that the guy made her come inside that he gave her instructions inside that once she was inside he hit her.
And she gestured Paula gestured with a karate chop on the back of the neck and that knocked her out and she was out for about forty five minutes and that she remembered getting hit.
And I said is that possible and I remember merry case thought about it very carefully into startling back in her chair and she said now that's impossible when an individual is hit hard enough to cause unconsciousness the soft brain tissue collides with the hard inner surface of the cranium creating a brain injury this disrupts the electrical activity in the outer areas of the brain where memories are stored and it's this disruption which prevents memory from forming not only of the traumatic event but for several minutes preceding the dramatic events.
This explains why individuals knocked unconscious in an automobile accident for example remember very little about the accident or the events leading up to the accident.
When police learned about this neurologic inconsistency they look for some connection between policy ends and the location where the body was discovered.
He'S found some three dimensional shoe impressions in the dirt a few feet away from the crash.
They appeared to be from an athletic shoes but they did not match any of the issues found in the Sam's home.
Next police said the black garbage bag which contained heather's body to the FBI laboratory in Washington DC.
Rancic examiner David Acton burger had little to work with since there were no fingerprints hairs or fibers found on the back the baby was found in a black garbage bag the bag itself was made by poly tech operation out of Minneapolis a Kmart was the retailer of the bags and they were sold under the brand name of curbside.
However more than one million of these curbside garbage bags were made for Kmart each and every day.
At Burger compared the edges of the bag containing have there's Sam's body to the first on use garbage bags from the sands kitchen but the stretching that occurs when bags are pulled from the role made matching the ends impossible.
But the bank had through scenes was in did have a signature characteristic.
Trash bags are made from large sheets of melted plastic blade makes the preparations so that the bags can be ripped from the end of the role at the same time a heat seal melts the bottom of the bag shop.
The heat seal as we found out from the manufacture.
As the plastic traveled beneath and through the heat seal.
More debris collected on that eats the more debris that collected on there the more unique identifying characteristics that we found we found incomplete melting of the heat seal this incomplete melting caused a small opening in the bottom of the head there it seems back to bring on the heat seal also produced a small puncture hole in the back.
When afternoon burger analyzed the bags found in the Sam's kitchen he found the same puncture holes in the same location.
And he also found the same small opening in the bottom of the bags caused by debris on the P. C..
The last step was to analyze the dye lines in the garbage bags.
As the plastic is pulled over the rollers in the manufacturing process it gets stretched leaving line or stretch marks in the plastic cold dial.
When the die lines on the inside of the heathers Sam's bag were compared to the die lines inside the first on use bags found in the Sam's kitchen the lines match the tiny puncture holes the defect in the bottom heat seal and the dye line comparison led the FBI to conclude that the first on news garbage bag in the Sims kitchen was made within ten seconds of the bag heather Simms body was found in.
Police now have their first piece of physical evidence linking an item in the same home where heather's body was found.
They were no longer searching for a mysterious kidnapper.
But a cold blooded murder.
When the FBI discovered at the heather Simmons garbage bag came from the same role of bags in the Sims kitchen they were now convinced Paul to Sam's was involved in her daughter's disappearance investigators learned that Paula and Robert sands had an unusual marital relationship a relationship Charles Bosworth described in his book precious victims.
All brought the little girl's home from the hospital she was essentially ousted from the the marital bedroom in the first case she and the laurel I slept in the basement was which is where the family room was a walk out basement only after Lorelai is death.
A year after more allies death only gave birth to a son Randy and in nineteen eighty nine after moving to Alton Illinois the Sims had another baby this time a doctor had here in the hospital Paula reportedly told her roommate that she didn't want another daughter the CCI and Robert preferred boys the evidence clearly suggested that boys were fine little girls were not welcome we were told repeatedly by witnesses that Robert adored the little boy and was just completely uninterested in the little girls even in the hospital after their births when Palmer brought had their home separate sleeping arrangements started again.
All and heather in the living room Robert in the two year old Randy upstairs and one of the comments that Paula made to wonder for friends was that the sleeping arrangements are going to have to stop or I'm gonna have to do something about it.
Based on the garbage bag analysis and the inconsistencies with her head injury story Paula Sims was arrested and charged with murder.
On Saturday night April twenty ninth nineteen eighty nine while Robert was working the night shift at the paper plant.
He placed the body in a garbage bag on the kitchen.
She probably wore gloves since no fingerprints were found on the back.
After the merger Paula drove across town to a parent's home where she placed heather's body in her parents freezing all the parents were away that week on vacation.
Paula returned home in enough time to paint on consciousness before her husband returned from work.
The next day when Paula's parents heard about the kidnapping they decided to end their vacation and return home immediately I don't.
This required change plan.
All the now had to go back to her parents home and remove heather's body before they returned.
With nowhere else to go prosecutors believe she brought heather's body back home placing it in her own basement freezer by this time police had concluded their search of the Sam's home and had left.
Three days later all the needed to get rid of the body once and for all.
She made the two mile drive over the Mississippi River across the Lewis and Clark bridge into a parking area.
And left the frozen body in a trash bin where it was discovered by a fisherman a short time later it was very premeditated very well thought out very cold blooded very systematic.
Secu should have no trouble showing motive.
As you walk through the sent home was very apparent that they had a boy the river products should be very normal for couples but if you look around the house the reception no indication whatsoever that they even had a daughter there weren't any baby pictures there weren't any.
Pitchers at all on the tables were around the walls or whatever T. indicate that they had a baby at all.
Paula Simons was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
I think it's a tragic event.
Any time in society when a parent comes to the point that they are so frustrated and whatever for whatever reason that they.
Decided to apply for one of their children well anytime you got the death of two and I might add very beautiful perfect little girls it's a very sad case when you add the element that their mother killed them it gets even worse.
On the other hand justice prevailed.
No charges were filed against Robert sams who denies he had anything to do with these two crimes there without my mind right person.
She murdered child.
She was tried by a jury repairs and she is now doing life.
There'S actually no doubt my mind she did it and Robert seems.
Not enough evidence right now.
I still have the case file.
