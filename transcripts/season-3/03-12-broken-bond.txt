When a two year old boy was rushed to the hospital suffering from brain seizures and breathing problems doctors could not find the cause of the only.
And make sure we continue to monitor that.
But the boy's sister provided an important clue the possibility of a rare syndrome if you have ever heard.
In nineteen eighty seven ray and Tonya reed along with their two children just moved to Urbandale Iowa.
It was rain reached fourth job transfer in three years my husband every time we moved it was advancement for him and I was ready you know anytime within him want to I want to go.
Tonya reed was a housewife who stayed at home to care for her children six year old Caroline and two year old Michael.
Just two days after moving to town their youngest child Michael stopped breathing fortunately Tonya was a nurse and knew exactly what to do she performed CPR and immediately took him to the emergency room at Iowa Methodist Medical Center that was fever a viral etiology dehydration and vomiting.
That was a pretty standard.
Diagnosis and situation.
After he was stabilized Michael was given a complete physical examination he had a prior history of neurologic seizures but doctors could not determine what was causing.
A few months later the reeds moved into a larger unit in the same complex ray was working extremely long hours and Tonya was lonely I think in the beginning their relationship was okay it was enough for Tanya because she was working and she had enough outlets in her life to you know keep herself busy and feel that she was happy but when she you know as the relationship went on in the years went by I think there was an emptiness and a lack of true affection between the two of them.
Three months later Michael had another episode he stopped breathing and turn blue.
When they arrived time he was on the floor of the living room giving Michael mouth to mouth resuscitation I'm sorry thank you very much.
At the hospital tests could not determine the cause of Michael's breathing problems the child's pediatrician speculated that Michael might simply be holding his breath.
One week later.
They'Re very calm for such serious natures to be doing mouth to mouth on a child I can just speaking for myself it was my child I'd be a nervous wreck just three years earlier Michael's older sister Morgan died unexpectedly at nine months old the autopsy said Morgan died of cardio respiratory arrest of unknown origin.
Like Michael Morgan had a history of breathing problems and numerous hospitalizations before she died.
Morgan'S death was a stressful time for the REIT's marriage we did have stress when Morgan died any couple will go off the streets when there's a death in the family the child death and we did stay together through all that.
One month later.
Medics were called to the reach home once again Kanya successfully resuscitated Michael before he was taken to the hospital numerous medical work ups had been done to try to find the cause of this including a number of pediatric specialists in pediatric subspecialists and nothing had been found.
Doctors were mystified what was wrong with my car.
I thank the doctors don't want to admit that they're infallible up their stuff and they can't find.
Soon doctors look deeper into Michael's breathing problem.
Doctors at Iowa Methodist Medical Center couldn't find the cause of the seizures and breathing problems two year old Michael reed was experiencing a few days after they returned to Ohio Michael stopped breathing again.
Tony Collins and the other paramedics were baffled and their log book showed.
Things didn't fit together what how old is breath long enough to make him.
Have seizures or quit breathing.
Then on Sunday February seventh while ray reed was relaxing downstairs.
He heard Tanya screams from the master bedroom.
It happened again Michael was having another breeding episode and was rushed to the hospital.
The nurse on duty noticed something unusual on Michael's cheek with some red parallel scratch marks scratches that looked like they had been made by the boy's fingernails.
To the nurse it looked as if Michael had tried to remove someone's hands from around his neck and mouth.
Just a few moments later an interesting coincidence Tonya reed asked the nurse to look at her finger it was bleeding I don't think I probably would have noticed if this had been my child that I had a scratch on my finger and I certainly would not mention it to anybody.
Michael was only two years old and too young to talk so it was impossible for doctors and social workers to interview.
But the scratch marks on Michael's face and his bleeding finger let doctors to suspect a rare form of child abuse called Munchausen syndrome by proxy it first appeared in the medical literature in nineteen seventy seven and was named after Barron final chosen an eighteenth century soldier famous for fabricating fabulous tales of his battlefield exploits mon chosen syndrome by proxy describes adults who either fabricate or actually cause illness in their own children they do this because they crave the attention and concern of the medical staff emergency personnel and even family members and friends when a social worker interviewed the reeds at the hospital about the possibility of child abuse Tanya was furious angry and hurt that it would even be.
Shock you know what every term probably went through every.
Tanya was given a lie detector test when she was asked if she ever intentionally caused harm to our children she said no.
And passed in addition to the scratches on Michael's face there was a pattern to the episode.
Afternoon that was cleared the paramedics from their time dated log book these calls were happening on the same days and roughly the same time a day and that struck me out as well almost exclusively the calls to the paramedics were on Tuesdays and Fridays always at about the same time of the day in the late afternoon or early evening.
For the most part they coincided with the days and times ray reed was at work.
The reads were convinced that Michael had a similar condition to the one that killed their daughter Morgan while they were living in Texas to find out medical detectives in Iowa decided to conduct their own investigation into Morgan reed's death.
Morgan reed was just nine months old when she died in nineteen eighty four Morgan's medical records revealed repeated visits to the hospital emergency rooms in Texas for breathing problems and seizures before she died.
Cause of death listed on Morgan's autopsy reports said cardio respiratory arrest of unknown origin.
Three other words in the report leaked out acute subdural hematoma a swelling in the brain which contains blood at the bottom of the page the past all the just had written no evidence of child abuse I was medical examiner was among the autopsy mentioned having to.
Fairly fresh subdural hematomas blood clots around the brain putting pressure on the brain.
Two distinct wins the call them recent clotted blood but there was no evidence of healing in this case so he found a finding that is abnormal.
Dr Bennett did a little investigating of his own and discovered.
For Morgan died for doctors noticed retinal hemorrhages leading in the back of our minds this told Dr Bennett at Morgan's airway might have been obstructed purposely when someone was trying to cause unconsciousness Dr Bennet did not believe that Morgan's death was of unknown origin.
He was convinced it was murder.
The retinal hemorrhages and subdural hematomas came from trauma specifically the violent shaking of the shaken baby syndrome once those words of shaken baby or spoken is the cause of death there's no doubt it's a homicide because Morgan's death.
Prosecutors in Iowa now Michael's life was in danger Michael had been hospitalized eighteen times in three different states his sister Morgan was hospitalized twenty times before she died.
Every single episode noted Tonya's claims she performed mouth to mouth resuscitation before emergency personnel arrived no one but Tanya had ever witnessed the onset of a seizure or breathing problem in either child we literally papered the office wall with flow charts and timelines so weak and look for this pattern that they eventually resulted.
Prosecutors searched the medical literature and discovered some common elements among those suspected of moon Chow's and syndrome by proxy.
Most are women.
They demand more and more tests and second opinions even after nothing has been found the child's illness does not occur when in daycare or with the babies.
There'S a family history of other siblings with the same problem or an unexplained sibling death suspects have an emotionally distant relationship with their spouse one third are in the medical field mostly nurses.
file was remarkable portrait of Tonya reed including the fact she was a nurse that's not really surprised because if you're going to go to a physician and make up something about your child if you knew nothing about medicine what so ever to be harder to make any kind of a convincing story where is if you have some sort of nursing background our health background of some sort any other physician you might be able to lie about something more convincingly.
And investigators were suspicious because no one other than Tonya had ever witnessed either of her children having a seizure I was the one that was always there.
An epicycle stances shop I think any woman whose husband works and she has a home stays home and takes care of the kids is going to happen that way.
The Polk County juvenile court determined that Michael was at risk living with his mother and he was turned over to foster care.
For the next two months Michael had no seizures at all.
But prosecutors weren't sure they could prove felony child endangerment against Tonya Thaxton read in a court of law.
On August tenth nineteen eighty eight Tanya Thaxton reed was arrested and charged with felony child endangerment in the case of her son Michael.
The trial began a little more than a year after the hospital nurse saw the scratches on little Michael reed's face.
Mon chosen syndrome by proxy is extremely difficult to prove there usually aren't any witnesses and juries have difficulty understanding of parents need for this type of attention if we have a problem with a broken bone in understanding how that's physical please mention we come in with something called Munchausen syndrome by proxy which is hard to spell and we're not quite sure how to pronounce it when the trial began prosecutor Melanie Haynes presented what she believed to be a pattern of abuse which began with Morgan and continued with Michael Haynes argued the Tonya reed intentionally suffocated Michael on eighteen separate occasions before reviving him and taking him to the hospital.
She also pointed out that Michael did not have any breathing problems or seizures during that time he had been in foster care.
The defense presented a report from the court appointed psychologist which said that Tonya was completely normal they also argued what Tonya had claimed all along there was a genetic cause of Michael seizures.
The Texas neurologist testified that both Michael and Morgan had abnormal brains which possibly caused the seizures.
Then on the morning of March second Tanya Thaxton reed took the witness stand in her own defense we were so nervous about what was going on and sure enough she took the witness stand and you can never be sure until they do that and she got up there on the witness stand and she looked very prim and very proper and she sounded like the very best PTA suburban mom that you could find Tonya reed denied killing her daughter Morgan.
No Sir I definitely did not.
Then Melanie Haynes began her cross examination don't you think it would be an awfully big coincidence to know another child on the way to you any account that had the same problem it would I don't know if it's a coincidence or not has that happened to you.
Not that I know you've never been in charge of another child that has had a similar problem your children.
Not that I can remember right off no.
When she said no I could've kissed her because every year it was such a why it was such an egregious lie staff had done their homework in nineteen seventy four when Tonya was fifteen years old she was baby sitting the child who would stop read.
Tanya immediately called paramedics saving the child's life Tonya became a local hero and won the town's good neighbor award.
Would you tell.
What received a good neighbor award for in nineteen seventy four.
I was babysitting Scott Simmons and the child quit breathing on me at the time.
Mark Pennington is an outstanding trial attorney but I have never seen a defense lawyer turned a whiter than a sheep like he did at that very moment and I was never really sure if he actually did know about that the prosecution was able to prove that there had been a lifelong pattern of abusive behavior.
On April twenty eighth nineteen eighty nine Tanya Thaxton reed was found guilty of felony child endangerment in the case of her son Michael.
She was sentenced to ten years in prison.
Not long afterwards Tonya reed was indicted in Texas for the murder of her daughter Morgan somehow tying your read had overly aggressive with Morgan and we felt that possibly but it happened here was that in an effort to I.
Q. block Morgan's air she may have gone too far and she could not get the child to start reading and that desperation frustration Morgan happened shook her violently to start her breeding again and that in turn because the subdural hematoma.
On December thirteenth nineteen ninety three the Texas jury found Tanya Thaxton read guilty of murder she was sentenced to sixty two years in prison the verdict was upheld on appeal.
Despite the convictions Tonya reed continues to maintain her innocence yes.
Always will maintain it for ever.
I'M having to do my time and I accept that I don't have to like it but I have to accept it which I have.
Most of the night and they did not even in the face of evidence on it you can show videotape in a if you had to cut type of Munchausen by proxy where there was some act that you can capture on on film if you showed it to him typically they'll continue to deny that that's going on.
The Iowa trial and trials in Texas broke new ground in child abuse cases across the United States.
Justice was done.
I felt a sense of retribution for Morgan but there is a poignant sadness to all of it it it had destroyed their entire family in so many lives.
Ray and Tonya reed are now divorced ray remarried Michael and his older sister Carolyn both lived with their father and his new wife.
Tonya reed is eligible for parole in two thousand nine.
It disturbs me that she is probably going to go through life denying what she did even though the court in Iowa has convicted of chain of child abuse two juries here and in Texas have convicted her of murder.
And you know her son was taken from her and never had another episode it's a strange syndrome where someone just will never admit what they've done she was offered a deal where she could have served maybe eight or ten years if she just admitted that she had done and she chose not to do that.
And this is the price that she's paying I mean she will sit there every day for fifty or sixty years or whatever good behavior she gets and she will remember it and you know.
