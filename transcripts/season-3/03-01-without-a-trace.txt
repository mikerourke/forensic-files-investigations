Seventy four centimeter long white male is when an eleven month old baby died under mysterious circumstances the autopsy samples provided few clues.
The path of the just noticed something suspicious the liver is diffusely yellow showing early signs of necrosis which is highly unusual for a child of this age you've never seen anything like it tissue samples will be sent to the lab for further testing.
Sally Ann Bruce Shelton lived in the quiet midwestern town of Omaha Nebraska.
All the high had many of the benefits of life in a large city with little of the crime and violence of other cities in size.
The Shelton's had been married for about two years Sally work for an insurance company Bruce was a television repairman.
Most of their free time to spend with their eleven month old son Chad whom they adored he was a big full baby big hands big feet like his Daddy he looked a lot like his Daddy but yet he had some features of his mama never sick he was a real healthy baby in a very sweet little baby.
On Sunday morning September tenth nineteen seventy eight.
Sally and Bruce had a full day planned shopping running errands and cleaning the carpets in their home.
I think clean the house and preparing it for some new furniture.
No they had money but they were trying to buy a piece at a time just like any family it started now so that they they were going to be a furniture store to get the lamps to spiffy up the apartment.
After furniture shopping they visited Sally's sister at a small family gathering.
Attended a birthday party.
And stop for tacos at a drive thru Mexican restaurant.
Later that night eleven month old Chad became ill he was pale lethargic and had vomiting so severe his parents had his entire body shock.
He was rushed to the Emanuel Medical Center.
This is Linda Dietrich was the nurse on duty within hours Chad was bleeding from every orifice I was terribly alarmed he looked like he was dying in front of me.
Like he was just going to die in front of me doctors ordered a full range of blood tests Chad's platelet count was nineteen thousand far below the norm of a hundred and forty thousand and the blood sugar level of eleven an indication of serious liver failure was come out of the corner of his eyes corner of his nose harvest now every poor had little bitty blood just just barely seeping out.
All over him.
It was horrible.
To see something like that early the next morning Chad children's heart rate dropped to forty six beats per minute and drop.
Doctors and nurses working feverishly to revive him without success.
Just forty eight hours after being admitted to the hospital Chad shall die.
And baby just started life.
A few hours later another patient was admitted to the hospital with the same symptoms this time.
Ninety five year old truck.
Something is terribly terribly wrong here these are two healthy people and now we have a little baby if it's dead and we have a twenty five year old man that's dying.
We don't know what's wrong with them.
Whatever had killed Chad Shelton doctors now feared it was spreading.
Twenty five year old Wayne Johnson was painting the exterior of his house when I first started to feel sick.
He had a headache muscle pain chills diarrhea and vomiting.
He also developed a severe nose bleed.
He was taken by ambulance to Emanuel Medical Center the same hospital treated Chad Shelton.
He was very sick and he was obviously bleeding into many cutaneous surfaces ID is scanned and probably bleeding and oozing into many internal organs.
A few hours later when Johnson died.
It was Linda Dietrich Chad Shelton's nearest who first discovered an alarming coincidence to Wayne Johnson was Chad Shelton's on.
My god what is going on here what is killing these people what we have here do we have an infectious disease is this a new type of viruses this one that we did understand was anybody else going to catch it soon there were more cases Chad's parents Bruce and Sally also had some vomiting Dwayne Johnson's daughter sherry was also sick and was admitted to the hospital.
Health officials held an emergency meeting to identify the cause of the mysterious outbreak and they called in the centers for disease control in Atlanta Georgia.
Dr Renata Kimbrough was a C. D. C. toxicologist assigned to the investigation she knew from the autopsy results that whatever killed these two individuals did so without leaving a trace and affected only the left.
The people didn't have fever normally if you have a very rapid onset of an infectious disease usually have fever up off of a high and these people didn't have that health officials frantically searching for clues.
Was it a chemical in the shampoo Chad's parents used on their carpets what was it the Mexican food from the drive in restaurant Chad's mother said the tacos didn't taste.
Dwayne Johnson had been painting his house was it something in the pain or the fumes.
During the course of their investigation health officials discovered the Chad Shelton and Dwayne Johnson were to get there one day about a week before they died it was at a family gathering at the Wayne Johnson's home.
The other family members to develop symptoms with there too obviously the water samples were taken insulation samples were taken soil samples were taken paint scrapings are taken we took everything that could possibly have the effectiveness.
A window air conditioner in Johnson's home was missing its filter and sat beneath the trees used by roosting birds health officials tested the soil for histoplasmosis capsule laid a yeast like fungus caused by contaminated bird feces.
They also discovered that lemonade had been served at the family gathering at the Johnson home everyone who drank the lemonade dot six three did not state well.
Unfortunately the lemonade was gone and the lemonade pitcher had been washed.
Tests on the tap water the lemonade mix and sugar used to make the lemonade were all negative and the soil outside the Johnsons home did not contain the fungus from contaminated bird species.
Sherry Johnson to Wayne's daughter survived her brush with the mysterious illness thanks to a blood transfusion but she suffered serious liver damage.
As Dr Kimbrough tended to analyze the autopsy slides she was baffled she had never seen such damage to human liver tissue before but when she looked through her back college textbooks she noticed a photograph that look surprisingly similar.
It was liver tissue of an individual who had been poisoned with the cancer causing H. dimethyl nitrosamines or D. M. D. M. man is a cancer causing agents given to animals in cancer research it was water soluble highly toxic and affects only the liver and would leave no trace an autopsy.
Dr Kimbrough now suspected foul play he told police to look for some connection between the family and someone who worked in the cancer research facility.
The suspected Chad Shelton and Dwayne Johnson had been murdered.
Dr Renata Kimbrough suspected the Chad Shelton and Dwayne Johnson had been poisoned with T. M. N. compound used to cause cancer in animals.
Everyone who consumes laminate that day either got sick or died but there was no.
The lemonade was gone and the picture wash.
Things don't happen like that.
To me and so I thought we ought to look it just didn't fit.
Birchard interview the surviving family members including Dwayne Johnson's wife sandy asking if they knew of anyone who held a grudge against their family they all said no.
Birchard search the police computer database and print the name of the Wayne Johnson and when he did.
He found the surprise.
Three years earlier when Twain and sandy Johnson were newlyweds there was a confrontation outside their home on the same.
His brother was wounded in the shoulder.
Another shot went through a front window.
The shooter was an old boyfriends of sandy's angry with Wayne for stealing his girlfriend his name was Steven Roy R..
Stephen Harper met sandy Johnson in high school sandy was a popular pretty blue eyed blonde.
Harper was an honor student quiet and the loner who planned to become a veterinarian.
Sandy Johnson was Harper's first girlfriend.
Harper was shy around girls as a child he was severely burned in a house fire which left him with scars both physical and psychological he always felt self conscious about a never date.
So very much consent comes along one love.
After the attack in nineteen seventy five Harper was arrested pleaded no contest to the shooting and was sentenced to up to five years in the state penitentiary but lieutenant Richard soon discovered that hopper served only one year of that.
After Harper was released from prison he took a job as a lab technician at the aptly Cancer Institute.
I thought well maybe this isn't so far fetched maybe I'm really right.
And it scared me.
Police obtained a search warrant for Harper's home in the garage they found evidence of animal experiments a local veterinarian told police that a month before Dwayne Johnson and Chad Shelton dot.
Treated Stephen Harper's dog and cat they both had unexplained bleeding and both animals die.
Who knows exactly what happened when Johnson in that.
That really convinced me that this is our boy but police had a problem.
They had plenty of circumstantial evidence linking Harper to the poisoning but they had no scientific proof.
D. M. man is rapidly metabolized in the body and excreted within hours of ingestion so there was no trace of it in any of the victims there was in effect no murder weapon we had a whole bunch of theories and suppositions and no evidence was where we were at we had to some in some other way proof that.
DM and had been there at the university of California at Irvine Dr Ronald shank a cancer researcher had been conducting animal experiments looking at how cancer causing agents like DMN altered the DNA dimethyl nitrosamines attacks the DNA of the liver cell and it leaves a chemical footprint on the D..
Will lead to a mutation which causes starts the cancer process.
Dr Kimbrough asked Ronald Chang if you would try something you've never done before to conduct his first human experiment she sent a coded samples of liver and kidney tissue in order to conduct a blind test one of the samples belonged to Dwayne Johnson although Dr shank had no idea which one.
High performance liquid chromatography separated the various components of the DNA and the computer charges those components visualized on the grass the lady from seven of the eight liver samples was completely normal one liver sample had DNA that gave us two extra peaks in the liquid chromatography of those two extra peaks were identical to what you would see if the individual had been exposed to dimethyl nitrosamines.
The liver sample belonged to Dwayne Johnson.
That'S what shank in camera did for the proved beyond a reasonable doubt that this was a substance used the exclusion of any other known substance in the world.
Science provided the murder weapon.
Other evidence would provide the full picture of Stephen Harper's deranged mind.
When Stephen Harper opened fire on the job.
Nineteen seventy five he was consumed with jealousy and rage over sandy Johnson's rejection.
With Harper in prison for the shooting is bizarre behavior continues email these pictures depicting sandy as a witch to her home.
Initially sandy Johnson couldn't believe that her old boyfriend was capable of murder which explains why she didn't identify him as a possible suspect they are unusual relationship was the focus of Thomas ians book toxic law she had painted the former boyfriend Stephen Harper as a very peaceful person he's a very loving person as a very good boyfriend he was not prone to violence quote unquote that sort of portrayal.
Very puzzling very perplexing why would she do that I don't know.
After prison Harper took a job at the at the Cancer Institute.
Published reports say it was here where Harper first learned about the deadly TMN.
A newspaper article had been posted on the company's bulletin board describing how German chemist killed his wife by putting D. M. man and her mom away.
Authorities believe that Harper confiscated DM and from a locked refrigerator in the lab.
And experimented at home to find the correct dosage.
Harper confided to a friend that he broke into sandy and Wayne's home on a Thursday night when no one was there.
For the D. M. man in a pitcher of lemonade he found a refrigerator.
The following Sunday afternoon the Johnsons Shelton's and the grandparents all gathered for what would be their last family get together.
Lane had been painting outside and had two large glasses of the lemonade to quench his thirst.
The eleven month old Chad had some lemonade in the Scott.
Sandy'S parents did not drink the lemonade and we're drinking coffee instead ironically the presumed target of the sabotage sandy Johnson didn't like lemonade and drank something else.
Twain died because he ingested two full glasses of lemonade more than the others.
Chad was simply too small for a system to handle the toxin.
Stephen Harper was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and three counts of poisoning with intent to kill.
He was sentenced to death in the electric chair.
But before that could happen Harper committed suicide in his cell.
Saddest story than you can ever think of you know it was sad enough to the child dies of people get poisoned that you have this plot of murder by cancer.
But you have living victims.
And his plot to kill.
With cancer may still come to pass.
Sherry Johnson was two years old when she ingested the DMN although a blood transfusion saved her life she suffers chronic liver problems to this day.
Bruce Shelton was so distraught over the murder of his son Chad and consumed by the fear that he would develop cancer.
Lost his job descended into a life of alcoholism and died homeless the age of thirty eight.
His wife Sally remarried and reportedly refused to have more children for fear she would develop cancer and not be alive to raise them that was the most ingenious way to commit the perfect crime to commit the perfect murder in give somebody something that nobody will suspect was he died years later of cancer you can detect it and without scientific evidence the case against Stephen Harper might never have been proven I've spent my whole career trying to find out how chemicals cause cancer in.
The vet that process and it bothers me that there would be people out there who would take the chemical like that use it to to try to call.
