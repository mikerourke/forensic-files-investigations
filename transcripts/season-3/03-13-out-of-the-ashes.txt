On a cold December night in nineteen ninety three.
Rose Larner left the convenience store on our way to a boyfriend's house.
But she was never seen or heard from again.
Bruce Rauner's disappearance remained a mystery until a tiny clue found years later uncovered a tragic tale of drugs romance and revenge.
Bruce Rauner was the second of three children and a broken family.
She was a highly intelligent but very difficult to.
Rose Larner was an eighteen year old girl who like to spend a lot of time out at night with her friends away from her family is a family that did dubbed her the vampire because they they they only saw her in the daytime rose's best friend bill brown was a boy she had known since second grade they remained friends even after high school first time I got a kiss from.
Nothing serious and we're just kids.
After high school girls working at a pizza shop in her home town of Lansing Michigan and started dating a friend of bill brown.
They came and quite polite.
He was a local.
Styrax Darren mean everyone thought he was.
I thought it was nice I thought it was alright.
Rose John key hole and bill brown were inseparable spending their days and most of their nights together.
For a time Rosen John Keogh live together but the relationship didn't last keyhole moved out and rose was devastated John at some point decided that he he wasn't interested in rows and tried to break it off.
Rose wasn't real keen on that idea.
On the night rose disappeared she stopped in to visit her mother who was working at the convenience store Rowe said she was headed to the home of her friend chief who live nearby she walked up to my work tell me she was walking out to a.
Roast preferred to walk that night instead of driving and did not return home.
The next day rose market called her daughter's friend Keith who said that rose never showed up.
Rose didn't show up for work that day either.
Lows ran on the wild side she was independent.
And it would not have been out of the out of the realm of possibility for her to have simply left the area and gone look for another lifestyle.
Rose Larner made approximately fifteen hundred telephone calls every month.
No one heard from her after she disappeared nobody heard from those in the detected those assigned case.
That was his sign that says there was something wrong there.
He said that someone just doesn't break a habit like that.
Bruce Rauner's mother still hopes for her daughter's safe return perhaps something in roses phone records would provide a clue.
After two weeks went by with no word from rose liner.
Lansing police began one of the most intensive searches ever undertaken in central Michigan.
They dragged area rivers coordinated search teams to look for clues in the surrounding neighborhoods and investigated every lead.
The persistent rumors roses and so and so's backyard roses and so and so's basement and I'll admit we dug up a few basements and drained a few gravel pits looking for rose with nothing came up dry every time nothing.
Police learned that rose liner spoke with the rex boyfriend John Ortiz key hole on the night she disappeared key hole had an alibi for that night he was on a date with another woman bill brown was with T. O. and his date on the night rose disappeared and corroborated key hose alibi.
For the next two and a half years police could find no trace of rose liner here simply Stein your stall that was where the police were at.
At the time two and a half years after she disappeared.
The state police began their investigation with a fresh look at rose's ex boyfriend John Ortiz key hello they quickly discovered the key hole and rose Larner had an unusual relationship one that continued even after they broke up.
In one incident rose followed key holder this fraternity house near Michigan State University T. hose on a date with another woman in a fit of anger rose drove a van into the side of the house truck she was smashing her mother's van into his truck breaking out as windows would come on my parents house she behind behind trees.
Police also learned the key hole and bill brown were in business together the drug business and had customers all over Michigan.
We use a task force but a lot of pressure on bill brown I mean we were talking to family members were talking to friends we're talking to neighbors were talking all kinds of people had been approached before.
Allen and he ho were together on the night rose Larner disappeared but police did not believe that brown had told them everything about their activities at night.
I know is in a very hard very very hard for them to be able to get a taste and the only way would be is if people started talking.
Bill brown originally said he knew nothing about roast liners disappearance.
But two and a half years later under constant police pressure he changed his story and it was a story so shocking few believe time when bill brown was sitting there in the office.
We were hearing things that we have never heard before it was an eye opener after listening to his whole story about what happened to rose whiner right I literally went home and told my wife that I felt like I'd just met Satan.
You know I I almost stopped on the way home and went into a church that I didn't belong to it's it was it was the most unsettling thing that I've ever been through to listen to that.
And police needed science to determine whether brown was telling the truth.
After two and a half years of searching for rose Larner bill brown finally revealed what happened on the night she disappeared.
Brown said that on December seventh he unexpectedly ran into rose Larner near the convenience store rose told brown she wanted to see John Keogh rose back in media page Jan and so I finally do I page John and.
She asks me to ask John to come pick her up.
Chances are we have agreed to that is she agrees to have sex with both of us.
Brown said rose agreed.
They drove to John key host grandparents home because they were away on vacation rose changed her mind about the threesome when she did brown said kilo murdered her and dismembered her body brown said they cleaned every square foot of the house removing all of the blood bone and debris.
Later they drove to a cabin owned by bill brown's parents where they burned roses body.
After which they spread roses ashes along miles of highway.
Brown said he didn't come forward sooner because he was afraid kee ho would murder him as well other one does get away from.
I just wanted to get away from.
And after that he basically kind of kept me hostage and he would let me out of the site.
After two and a half years.
Police finally had the break they were hoping for but they needed to know if brown was telling the truth it's been involved in the drug scene that he ran with this group the.
I would cite violence was a part of their world.
Brown said rose was murdered in the bathroom.
Police sprayed the area with luminol a chemical which can reveal trace amounts of blood even after it's been removed with water and detergent but they found nothing.
On a hallway carpet the luminal revealed what appeared to be the imprint of a bloody bucket but after two and a half years there was not enough blood to perform DNA testing investigators feared they were at a dead end until they noticed a small spot on the wall paper just outside the bathroom I had the color consistent with blood in it had kind of the configuration of what you would suspect if a blood drop that was falling down a wall.
The spot looks like part of the wallpaper pattern.
The Q. tip turned positive presumptive test for the presence of blood.
Because we didn't have a lot of what's keep in mind just because we find a drop of blood I mean it could be the grandparents it could be anybody's blood that that we didn't know for sure in my mind I'm thinking you know could this be a blood drop of roles learner.
And this point you know of course I got very excited and thought you know what if this could actually be from our victim scientists were able to extract enough blood from the wallpaper for DNA analysis but they have nothing to compare it to.
East learned that she had been involved in a sexual assault four years earlier after the assault a sample of her blood was taken and still existed in police custody the DNA profile from the blood on the wallpaper matched the DNA from rose liners blood samples the odds of the blood belonging to anyone else or one in seven hundred forty seven.
Identifying it Israel's learners is what's remarkable that tells us what roles learner was in that house at that time that cooperates with bill brown told us that was crucial.
Brown also revealed that the both wrenched rags soaked with roses blood in the basement sump pump forensic scientists gathered all of the debris from the bottom of the brain.
They also excavated the fire pit your bill brown's parents cabin where rose's body had allegedly been burned the search resembled an archaeological dig my jab at that site was to excavate the fire pit and collect any remains any evidence that fire pit that might be relevant to the case specifically I was looking for evidence for human bone human material.
The fragments were analyzed with an ultraviolet light in order to determine whether they were.
Under ultraviolet light bone will glow.
The fragments that I did end up finding work very very small probably none of them are larger than the size of a pea.
so initially when all the dirt and debris was in there it was very difficult to tell we had.
The bone chips were too damaged and degraded for DNA analysis but they were analyzed to determine if they were human.
Magnified one hundred times human bone is circular instructure wild animal bones seeing here is more linear.
The bones found in both sides were clearly human.
The number of circular structures in the bones or Pasti on's increases with age there were relatively few Asti arms in the bone chips found in the debris we were able to determine that the remains were clearly human.
And in some cases they probably represented somebody who is a teenager or in their early twenties.
From fine bone fragments in the house and it cooperated with the bone fragments that we found in northern Michigan at the site where I'm bill brown's proper they took her and burned her remains.
The blood and the bone chips were exactly where bill brown said they'd be police were now convinced that rose Larner had been murdered.
According to bill brown's confession and the forensic evidence prosecutors now knew what happened to rose Larner on her last night alive.
Shortly after visiting her mother at the convenience store rose ran into were childhood friends build brown.
And roses suggestion they picked up her ex boyfriend John key how.
Gonna go inside grabs the night's festivities John T. ho bought some supplies for the evening including a hatchet and knife and some lighter fluid.
Brown said he was not aware of the specific items D. hope purchased until later that night.
One six T. hose grandparents home all three took a shower together.
The whole again tried to initiate sexual three seven but rose refuse.
At the same without warning T. hose strangled her.
In the shower stall key host let her throw dismembered her body using the knife and hatchet he purchased at the store.
Brown and Keogh spent the next two days cleaning the blood bone and debris.
A bloody bucket left the stain on the carpet found years later with the luminal rags soaked with blood and bone were rinsed in the basement sump pump with tiny pieces of bone were also discovered in the blood spot on the wall was identified as rose learners through DNA testing.
The body was burned in an outdoor fire pit.
After the cremation the ashes were dumped out of the car window as key hole in brown drove back to Lansing I did say a prayer for right afterwards and I'm not a religious person I did pray for her soul.
The bones in the sump pump the luminol impression of the bloody bucket the tiny speck of blood on the wallpaper and the bone fragments in the fire pit all confirmed brown's story.
Before police could question John key hope he fled the country after a six month international manhunt key hole was finally located by song for the first time.
In Mexico he was drinking a beer in a bar.
Four minutes later reset and US customs and hands on the other side of the bridge it was like.
Slam bam and these are there right now I don't think he knew what happened.
At the trial key hole had a ready defense he claimed that it was bill brown who had murdered roast liner junkie who was going to point the finger at him and say well Gee I didn't do it I was just there and he killed my girlfriend he went nuts on coke and killed my girlfriend we knew that was coming.
Prosecutors argued that bill brown had no motive to kill rose liner.
John T. ho dead his motive was the problems it rose Lerner was causing for him in the days and weeks prior to her disappearance she was embarrassing him she.
It'S typical for role is not to be intimidated by this guy and to simply get into arguments with him and call names not back down that was rose Larner and and this I think was something new for Jackie hole ended it angered him really angered him.
Although the crime occurred two and a half years earlier rose Larner was still able to speak to the jury through the power of forensic science in this case I you know I don't take the position that we didn't have a body I think we did we just had very small pieces of it so I mean they basically gave us a body.
The jury deliberated just over an hour.
T. ho received Michigan's maximum sentence life in prison without possibility of parole.
All that remains of a body of the tiny bone fragments which are still in evidence.
A person like that.
If you were to die I hope it's.
Bill brown was sentenced to one year in prison for helping cover up the murder he is now out on parole so enormous and take place like I said I would have been she when the banner now what happens when I feel about it is that by convicting Jackie how I'd save other people's lives other young girls lives because I just feel that.
He was his nature.
And that he enjoyed killing.
