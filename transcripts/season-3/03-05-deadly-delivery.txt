In December of nineteen eighty nine federal court judge Robert Vance and his wife were preparing for the busy Christmas holiday.
It was a delivery.
Robert and Helen vans lived with their family in an affluent suburb of Birmingham Alabama.
For more than a decade Robert Vance had been a federal court judge for the eleventh district presiding over cases from Alabama Georgia and Florida.
He was very bright not only the book smart kind of bright but he had just been amazing common sense street smarts.
Judge Vance undoubtedly had his share of enemies but had never received any threats which explains why he wasn't suspicious of the package mailed to him a few days before Christmas.
With nails wrapped around pipes which acted like shrapnel.
The blast killed judge Vance instantly his body was thrown clear across the kitchen.
Miraculously Helen van survived the explosion and she was able to get to a neighbor's home for help.
suffered some severe injuries from explosions she had several cuts in the flash from the naval said the bomb and bound with and she had several internal injuries I'm from nails actually penetrating the body including one that had done some damage to her liver.
U. S. marshals warned all members of the judiciary to be on the alert for any suspicious mail packages.
Two days later a security guard at the eleventh circuit court in Atlanta noticed something unusual in a routine X. ray of packages entering the building.
Inside the package wasn't too attached to a pair of flashlight batteries the tell tale sign of the pipe bomb.
Investigators did not want to detonate the bomb they wanted it dismantled in order to study its construction when they did experts determined that this bomb was identical to the one that killed judge Robert banks the bombs does we're doing a very angry guy because of the nature of their construction and the nature of that construction also told us that we were dealing with a very purposeful.
Individual someone who would not just idly got mad done this but someone who really did a good deal of work and in putting this together.
The bomb had two unique characteristics which investigators had never seen before the bomb and the inside of the box had been covered with black enamel paint it had square and caps which were bolted and welded on to the ends which delayed the explosion and increased its force unfortunately scientists could find no trace evidence inside the bomb package no hair fibers or fingerprints the bomb was similar to a tear gas bomb which exploded for months earlier in the Atlanta office of the national association for the advancement of colored people or in double ACP.
Along with that bomb was a letter a declaration of war against the eleventh circuit court.
No one knew why a threat against the eleventh circuit court had been sent to the N. double ACP which was involved in civil rights issues.
Investigators suspected that the tear gas bomb was mailed as a test to see if it could be sent through the mail without exploding.
When that test was successful the bombers started on his path of murder.
Two days after the bomb explosion which killed judge Robert Vance Robert Robinson a civil rights attorney went to work as usual at his office in Savannah Georgia waiting for him on his desk was a package that had been sent to him through the mail.
When he opened it it exploded.
His friend Dr brown was across the street and rushed to his aid I'm just holding him at this point looking around the room.
Surveying course of damage and seeing the wounds.
That he had suffered it throughout that process you see having my arm under his arm pit.
Three hours later.
Robert Robinson died.
The bomb was set to detonate when the string wrapped around the outside of the package was pulled the string was attached to a battery powered charge triggering the explosion.
All of the bombs were identical and the bomber was to kill us in every detail of their construction.
The bombers sprayed black paint over the inside of the box which covered up possible evidence such as fingerprints for five years.
And the bomber was careful not to leave any genetic material such as hair or saliva on the mailing labels or on the backs of the stamps.
That some of the finest forensic machinery.
In the world failed to find one speck of DNA.
So much is said trace a powder under a fingernail on the same day that Robert Robinson was murdered well the Dennis received an identical package in the mail.
At the time really Dennis was president of the N. double ACP office in Jacksonville Florida.
But Mister Dennis was late for a meeting so she left her office before opening the package that night at home she received a phone call from a friend this is the you know I don't know if you heard the news but Bonnie Robinson in Savannah Georgia has received a bomb.
And and he was killed instantly he said if you receive any further packages one of the packages are you make sure that you're notified sheriff's office which is what she did.
Was a pipe.
I saw a common theme which was a bomber signature all four box that led me to conclude that not only the same person or persons but the same.
Constructed the four bombs it's collusion of anybody else.
There were four letters inside the package one took responsibility for the murders of judge Vance and Robert Robinson another made reference to the tear gas bombs sent a few months earlier to the N. double ACP the officer who opened up a smoke bomb the offices of the NAACP have become targets for assassination the letters and mailing labels have all been tight with the same type writer which had a signature for the number one on the keypad did not match the type face of the other keys it was a replacement there was a a broken key which was replaced with a different type.
Key so that was fairly unique I mean the odds of finding another one with that same letter replaced with another typewriter was was a fairly unique characteristic.
The FBI search the files of the eleventh circuit court looking for any documents which might have been tight with the same type right.
More than one million documents were examined the FBI found one letter type with the same type it had the same flaw the number one was a different typeface the letter dealt with an obscure life insurance case from nineteen eighty seven.
And the sender was alive and well in the small town of enterprise Alabama.
The investigation into these bombings became the largest and most exhaustive in the history of federal law enforcement.
Investigators use every method at their disposal to find the typewriter used to type the letters and mailing labels on the bomb packages their investigation revealed that the same typewriter had been used by a man in enterprise Alabama Robert lane feral to type a letter about an insurance dispute my sense of the typewriter match that led them to enterprise why is that this was believed by agents to be almost tantamount to a fingerprint I mean a solid forensic lank Ferrell was a junk dealer and investigators searched every inch of his home garage and warehouse use an excavator his septic system but they couldn't find the typewriter Ferrell recalled typing the insurance letter but couldn't remember what happened to the typewriter his daughter had a vague recollection of selling it to a young woman about a year earlier but could provide no description of the buyer and she had no receipt of sale.
With the typewriter now a dead end investigators were left with the bonds as their main source of evidence pictures of the bombs were distributed to bomb experts throughout the country no one had ever seen a bomb constructed quite like this before got a call from very good friend of mine lord or one who is a.
And I said something to the effect the but damn despite bomb I've ever seen it's got a rope threaded rod ran right through the middle of it.
And I went on to say something to the effect that I'd never seen or heard of such a design feature in a pipe bomb.
And his response was well I have.
Tell me about.
Lloyd Irwin recalled a similar bomb many years earlier one with the rod through the center and the same distinctive square and caps there's only one that that would ever had like that we have lots of pot bombs and different kinds of the remote control.
But when you have one is only the only one you've ever seen like it I mean and it sticks to.
when search through the thousands of cases in his file all the way back to nineteen seventy two and learned that the bomb he recalled had accidentally named a woman who came across it unexpectedly in her home.
Authorities suspected that the bomb had been constructed by her husband Walter leroy moody.
Although he denied it moody was convicted of constructive possession of that bomb and sentenced to six years in the state penitentiary Walter leroy moody was furious about that conviction and after he was released from prison spent the next ten years trying to have his conviction overturned.
Mark Winnie described moody's legal battles in his book priority mail I think those who have come to know Moti and various fears.
I would say that movie could be charming he could be in some respects enormously bright I think one.
Psychologist called him a genius.
But on the other hand.
He could become.
Blinded by obsession.
That obsession may have included the case of Julie loves a young white woman who was murdered and raped by a group of black defendants in one of the most highly publicized cases in Atlanta history case tried at the eleventh circuit court.
This was the case mentioned in one of the bombers letters.
And it's not a black and white in Alabama Florida or Georgia in the future.
This not happen chance that he's mad with the eleventh court of appeals.
And the eleventh court of appeals is made up of the states of Alabama.
Florida and Georgia.
So all three of those states got about.
But if Walter leroy moody was the bomb.
Authorities couldn't prove it they had no forensic evidence linking him to any of the bomb.
After interviewing more than six thousand people pouring over a million documents and examining the case files of every bombing in the United States federal authorities were convinced that Walter leroy moody was the serial bomber.
Federal agents searched the home he shared with his second wife Susan.
The search was so complete that even the floorboards were removed and the entire residents vacuum for gun powder and other trace evidence.
But authorities could not find one single piece of evidence in their search I'm not concerned about anybody finding any connections.
Regarding those or any other bombings have that.
Although investigators found nothing inside movies home it was what they didn't find that was revealed.
The first search of the house.
Appeared as the house have been sterilized meaning that the normal things that would be found in the house that could be used to fabricate a bomb device wire nails pliers even pieces of pipe things that you probably have around your house they were totally lacking absent this house.
But the pressure of a federal investigation was too great for Susan noted she was twenty years younger than her husband and told authorities that movie was emotionally and physically abusive.
When she was questioned separately without her husband she provided some interesting information.
Just the same way as always.
Susan moody said that her husband often took her shopping at stores throughout the southeastern part of the United States.
He told her to buy steel pipe.
Cubing raincoats rubber gloves shower caps and safety glasses.
She was also told to buy black and now.
And she said her husband once shoplifted some nails from the store in Georgia nails similar to those which for use in the pipe.
Investigators believe that movie use that cap gloves and safety glasses to dress himself like a surgeon while making the bombs so that he wouldn't leave genetic material in the package.
Moody'S sprayed the inside of the package with black enamel paint to mask any fingerprints hairs or fibers that may have been left in the parking.
Prosecutors believe that movie removed all of the materials he used to make the bombs before his home was searched.
Susan moody also confirmed that she had purchased a used typewriter for her husband which had later been thrown away.
There was one more piece of evidence that investigators had almost given up on the fingerprint found on one of the bombers letters Susan moody told the FBI that she had copied the letters for her husband in a small shop in Florence Kentucky.
When the copy machine ran out of paper one of the employees put more in.
When he did his fingers touched the top piece of paper.
The employee's fingerprints matched the one found on the threatening letter which confirmed Susan moody story.
It was the link investigators need to tie in to the bombs.
And that's where they bought the boxes that contained the bombs and it's where they did some xeroxing and to prove that they did the xeroxing the fingerprint was there the fingerprint did not change the pattern on the Xerox machine changes over a period of time so it's forensically that fingerprint to the exclusion of everything else in the whole world put them at the place that she said they were where they bought the boxes if you look at Susan moody's testimony by itself.
Where we could have been the potential for the defense to say.
This is the ex wife.
Well as a motive.
To want to stay out of jail.
The key is that much of what Susan moody testified to could be corroborated by forensic science.
Susan moody was granted immunity and testified for the prosecution.
Walter leroy moody was found guilty of the murders of judge Robert Vance and Robert Robinson and was sentenced to death by electrocution athlete if.
We have not identified moody as a potential suspect very quickly.
I don't think he was three.
I really don't think he was for I don't think he would have ever been through as long as he was out there.
The evidence suggests.
That the bombers obsession.
Just that much deadlier.
That much more vicious and destructive.
Some people would call that irony I think some people would call it justice.
