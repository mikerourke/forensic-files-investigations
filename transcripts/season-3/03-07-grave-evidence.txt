Two friends spent a summer afternoon skeet shooting in Pennsylvania.
The other died of what was determined to be an accident.
What happened that day sent shock waves through a small town and launched a mystery it would take twenty years to solve.
Montrose is a quiet rural area in the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania it's a small close knit community with stately homes one traffic light in the courthouse that dominates the town square in nineteen seventy six Montrose was home to thirty year old Martin Dillon his wife and their two young children ninety dealing with very popular man in town and his father was the local mayor I mean everybody knew him and and really liked them on June second nineteen seventy six Martin Dillon left work early to go skeet shooting at his family's hunting camp a secluded place called gun smoke is good friend Dr Stephen Scherer went along Stephen sure was one of the town's doctors and a close personal friend of the Dylan's.
Martin asked some other friends to go with him that day but they all had other plans and I said Marty I can't go on I should I guess just so much going on I just can't get away.
A few hours later.
Martin goal was laying on his back with his arms outstretched clay pigeons under one arm the room itself was dead center in the chest right into the heart there was no mistaking that went straight into Dylan's gear protectors and sun glasses were lying on the ground near his body the shoe lace of his right boot was on tight.
Dr sure told police that he and Dylan were headed towards the cabin when Dylan spotted a porcupine grab sure is loaded shot gun and ran to shoot it.
Sure said Dublin apparently tripped over a shoe lace and fell on his gun which went off accidentally blasting a hole into his chest.
Ran into the he smashed a shot gun against a tree in a fit of rage saying the guns would never kill anyone again.
State policeman Frank Zane and took the photographs of the scene.
This is all this doesn't make sense because.
Insane and was concerned about another part of the story well he said he rolled him over he tried to perform CPR is CPR this is a whole free through his heart.
Mark Demens body was taken to the county morgue in the basement of a funeral home in Montrose on the death certificate the car owner who was a political appointee ruled the manner of death an accident.
The funeral took place in the same church where Martin Dylan was married Dr sure was one of his pallbearers for marking Dylan's father Larry sadness was overshadowed by suspicion and doubt he did not believe his only son's death was an accident.
A few months after the shooting death of Martin Dillon Dr Stephen shirt divorced his wife and some said it was the stress of the death of his best friend others said trouble had been brewing between sure and his wife for some time either way Stephen sure removed from the small town of Montrose Pennsylvania and eventually settled in North Carolina.
A year and a half later Stephen sure remarried his new wife.
The window of his best friend Martin.
When Larry Dillon learned that his daughter in law and his two grandchildren were moving in with the only witness to his son's death he grew increasingly suspicious.
He questioned the conclusions of his son's autopsy which was done by a family doctor who's not trained in forensic medicine.
So Larry Dylan went to visit this man.
Then a friend of his sons and the former police officer who was running a small company in Montrose specializing in accident reconstruction he felt that.
He was murdered he did not tell me specifically wine or you couldn't he just felt as hard as it was not the way it was reported was correct.
Bennett started the autopsy photos and read the report the first thing he noticed was the Dylan's room was one inch by one and a half inches in size but the internal diameter of a sixteen gauge shot gun is five eight seven eight.
A contact wound made by that gone would be the same size five eighths of an inch and not any larger.
To find out for sure Stu Bennett conducted an experiment he stretched skin of romantic and and use the same make and model sixteen gauge shot gun with the same ammunition used in the accident in order to create a warm the same size the gun had to be three to five feet away from the skin now when I say the firearm is three to five feet away I'm talking about the end of the barrel.
All right where the shell actually comes out.
Now you have another forty inches.
Thirty six to forty inches to the trigger housing itself.
So now you're up to six feet away between five and six feet away from the trigger housing to discharge the firearm.
Which means it'd have to employ a stick or some other type of string or to have the gun discharged.
And there was no gun powder residue on Dylan shirt which would have been present if it had been a contact wound and there was no blood from the wound found on the shot gun barrel.
Stu Bennett suspected homicide and shared his feelings with Larry Dillon it didn't surprise her.
The family broke down and cried.
Like others in the small town of Montrose began to hear rumors the doctor sure and Martin Dylan's wife packed.
Having a sexual affair before Martin's dad Pat Dillon had been a nurse at Montrose general hospital the same hospital where Dr sure practiced there were rumors going on right it's always in the hospital of open caressing that certain sort of thing going.
Maria after the holidays describe this clandestine relationship in her book secrets from the grave they just didn't seem to care they didn't care if anyone knew if anyone saw them when they were caught they just sort of just went back to their work and you know it would just happen again seasons past then years.
And in time law enforcement agencies moved on to other cases but questions remain.
What really happened that gun smoke that day in June of nineteen seventy six.
For almost twenty years those questions remain unanswered.
Martin Dylan's parents never gave up their fight to have their son's death to reinvestigate they were convinced that the autopsy was incomplete and the manner of death in correct.
The state policeman who photographed the accident scene agreed with the Dillons and was never convinced it was an accident.
It'S very frustrating when people don't wanna listen and you know something's wrong.
The back then the state police.
I mean I love the state placers with over twenty eight years but they haven't backed them especially a philosophy where is if you have less time on the job then another man you don't know anything.
All right senior man always ruled in nineteen ninety one fourteen years after the accident Frank Zane and others helped convince the state police to send the evidence to the FBI lab in Washington DC and they also sent the evidence to this man.
Herbert macdonell an expert in blood spatter.
The first thing he analyzed with the boots Dr sure was wearing on the day of the accident.
Dr sure said he was a hundred and fifty feet away from where Dylan tripped fell and accidentally shot.
McDonnell discovered a very fine mist of blood which she identified as high velocity impacts badger level of city impact spatter results when something moves such as a bullet or shotgun pellets strike the short block like the body.
As a result energy breaks up blood into very small.
High velocity impact spatter was also found on the side of the tree stump closest to Dylan's body and on the instep of Martin Dublin's left shoes.
This indicated that Dylan was walking near the tree stump when he was shot not running after a porcupine.
For rent six technologist Dr Isidore Metallica's was also asked to look at the evidence he noticed another inconsistency in the photograph of Dylan's body the legs of his trousers were pulled up exposing his socks indicating that somehow he had been either in a seated warning squatting position otherwise why would the cops right out Dr Malek is also noticed what is called scalloping on the edges of the gunshot wound evidence at the shop Alex had started to spread as they traveled through the air before striking the skin.
Scalloping does not occur around a contact wound.
Once the Dylan's heard of this new information they filed the petition to excuse their son's body for a second autopsy this time Dr Mallika spur forms the autopsy.
Doctor Metallica's discovered that the direction of the wound track was in a downward direction at a forty five degree angle.
The shot came from the right of Martin Dillon and went through Dylan's hard and left alone.
The one track is wrong if the gun had dropped.
And then shot him either have it perfectly backwards war and now Ford won't track here this would be sharply downward I am very angulated from right to left authorities could no longer ignore the evidence and on June twenty six nineteen ninety five marked Dillon's dad was formally declared a homicide.
The next day Dr Stephen sure and his wife Pat returned to Pennsylvania to hold a news conference sure told reporters he was innocent and still maintains that Dylan was chasing a porcupine and fell accidentally shooting himself in the chest the last time I saw Marty doing alive he was moving away from me up the end of this trail towards where we had just been.
and I just waited there for him to come back or tell me to do something else.
And I think I yelled out you couldn't have broad side of a barn.
Steve is not capable of the things they've accused him of I've known him and lived with him for seventeen years he's not capable of this.
Is it true that you two had an affair absolutely not.
They'Ve got a murder case.
Investigators all the state police say that their autopsy and everything else.
The challenge was accepted.
Dr Stephen sure was arrested and charged with the murder of Martin del.
Two decades after his death.
Martin Dylan would finally get his day in court.
Twenty one years after the shooting death of Martin Dylan.
Even sure sat in the courtroom on trial for the murder of his former friend.
Turning to the prosecution Martin Dillon news the teacher was having an affair with his wife and told him that day while speech using that he talked it over with his wife Pat and she agreed to end her affair with her sheer would not accept this was she was obsessed and he said to himself it's not going to be this way.
It'S not going to be this way I'm going to get what I want one way or another.
You have to die.
While Martin Dylan was re loading the machine with clay pigeons Stephen Scherer placed special ammunition into his gun.
Moved to within five feet.
Fired a single shot into the center of his chest.
The shot into Dylan's chest at a forty five degree downward angle directly into his heart the blast caused high velocity impact spatter to land on shirts boots and on to the side of the tree stump nearest to Dylan's body.
Sure then invented the story about Dylan running after a porcupine with this guy.
He picked up the gun and smashed it against a tree and a public display of three.
Dr sure learned of the forensic evidence against him he changed his twenty one year old story.
Finally admitted that he had been having an affair with Dylan's wife Pat at the time of the accident he also admitted fabricating the porcupine store.
But he still claims marquee Dylan's death had been.
Sure said he and Martin argued over the affair there was a scuffle and the gun went off accidentally.
Sure said he didn't think anyone would believe so he staged the accident scene and made up a story about the porcupine.
But prosecutors didn't believe this new version either the only reason he put himself.
In proximity to the deceased at the time was because of the overwhelming evidence we had.
Of the blood spatter on his boots the angle and direction of the track.
Hi tops trousers with the socks showing them the size and location of the blood spattered all pointed to only one conclusion that Martin Dillon while near the.
By Stephen sure.
He had essentially been dumped Pat Dillon said now I'm I'm staying with my husband I'm not leaving him I'm not divorcing him.
German children Dr sure had raised since they were small stood solidly behind their stepfather during the trial even contributing a part of their father's life insurance proceeds for his defense but the forensic evidence was too great.
The jury convicted Dr Stephen sure of first degree murder and he was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
It'S a case in which originally.
Somebody somebody's word and believe that and did not look any further and there was no.
No in depth investigation done at that particular time the villains had some peace of mind.
That is what what really what I wanted to see was the Dylan's relieved of the burden that had been hanging on their shoulders for all those years.
And I was happy for them.
The verdict was a long victory for the parents of Martin down.
Larry what kind of when the first referred to came back we think of morning.
After Dr sure spent twenty months in prison.
In Sylvania Superior Court overturned his conviction a judge said the state's twenty year pre arrest delay caused substantial prejudice to his right to a fair trial in two thousand two that decision was overturned Dr Scherer was retried in March of two thousand eight a jury deliberated just two hours before finding him guilty yet again you will spend the rest of his life behind bars.
