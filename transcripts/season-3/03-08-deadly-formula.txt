Four month old Bryan Stallings said spent an entire weekend.
Twenty also develop reading problems his mother decided to take to St Louis children's hospital.
Somewhere along the way the Tricia Stallings made the wrong turn and got lost.
It was a mistake she'll regret for the rest of her life.
But Tricia and David Stallings had been married for about a year.
I recently moved into a home overlooking lake Wanaka just outside of Saint Louis Missouri.
David was a printer Patricia who worked in the convenience store.
After an entire weekend of vomiting and breathing problems the Christian decided to take the baby to St Louis children's hospital.
During the trip the Tricia got lost and ended up at the emergency room of cardinal Glennon children's hospital instead.
He was given a complete medical examination including blood and urine tests.
Ryan'S blood samples were sent for testing to an outside independent black.
The SmithKline Beecham clinical lab in Saint Louis.
Gas chromatography on Ryan's blood sample found the cause of the child's illness it was ethylene glycol poisoning.
Ethylene glycol is a colorless sweet tasting substance found in industrial solvents and resins it can be fatal in large enough doses.
Hospital officials notified both the sheriff's department and the Missouri department of family services.
Investigators searched the storms home.
In the basement they found two containers of anti freeze under a pool table.
One of the containers was half empty and it listed ethylene glycol as the main ingredient.
Formats long live call in your body the body can act naturally format therefore has to be ingested and when you've got a child who's four months old a child who is four months old doesn't have the capability of ingesting anything therefore had to be purposefully ingesting.
Fortunately Ryan's condition gradually improved when he was released from the hospital he was not returned to his parents instead the department of family services placed Ryan in foster care until they completed their investigation.
And that investigation revealed some troubling information they discovered that Patricia Spalding's was the mother of another child a five year old son who was in her sister's custody because of allegations of child abuse.
He was born out of wedlock when she was young subsequent to his birth he was taken away from her by the state when they discovered that he was in the first stages of frostbite malnutrition.
now Patricia's explanation to me at the time was it you know the reason that he was in that state was because she was in a similar state because you have money in a place to live.
While Ryan was in foster care Patricia was only permitted to visit him once a week under the supervision of the department of family services or DFS.
A few days after six rental this.
Ryan got sick once again and was taken to cardinal Glennon children's hospital.
This time the lab found even higher levels of ethylene glycol in Ryan's block nine hundred eleven milligrams per milliliter of blood serum.
Brian'S blood was also sent to the toxicology lab at the university of Saint Louis.
They performed another text called mass spectrometry.
Tom the same thing ethylene glycol in Ryan's blind.
Although the baby bottle Patricia used to feed Ryan during her supervised visits had been washed and re fill.
Tests on that bottle found trace amounts of ethylene glycol.
And prosecutors learned of the individual assigned to stand guard during Patricia's visit with Ryan inexplicably left the room for a short time against instructions.
Prosecutors suspected that Patricia had poisoned Ryan again after the supervisor left the room we went over in detail talking to every person that was there in the room every movement that was in the room what things were brought into the room the bottle seized from the visit again tested positive for ethylene glycol.
A Tricia Stallings was arrested and charged with assault.
Today when Ryan was diagnosed with ethylene glycol poisoning his treatment included both fasting and ethanol given intravenously to counteract the effects of the ethylene glycol.
One week later.
The charge against Patricia Stallings was now murder.
When four month old Ryan Stallings died a social worker from cardinal Glennon children's hospital called Patricia Stallings impression to inform her of her son's death.
I don't care about that.
David on the phone I want to get out of this hell hole.
The church's response raised suspicions when you put those kinds of statements and reactions and all the things in the circumstantial evidence together with the science in only point one person.
Laboratory tests revealed large amounts of ethylene glycol and Ryan's blood.
Ethylene glycol is the main ingredient in anti freeze scientists also found trace amounts of ethylene glycol in the baby bottle Patricia Stallings used to feed Ryan during her last visit.
Three months later.
Ill in prison awaiting trial Patricia Stallings learned some surprising news.
During her pregnancy Patricia became friends with prison guard Patty Matthews.
She was very depressed most of the time.
Five months after Ryan's death Patricia Stallings gave birth to David Stallings junior in a hospital near the prison.
A Tricia and David nicknamed him teacher.
When DJ was just a few weeks old he had an episode of vomiting seizures and breathing problems while in foster care.
DJ was rushed to St Louis children's hospital.
Ironically it was the hospital Patricia planned to take Ryan to before she got lost.
Doctors diagnosed DJ with the very rare metabolic disorder called methyl malonic acid the media or am M. A. which inhibits the body's ability to process food especially proteins it also produces toxins in the blood.
The prosecutors it was a startling development they wondered if Ryan Stallings might have died of the same disease instead of ethylene glycol poisoning.
We went back to square one at met again with all the doctors and said look.
something's not right here in math fact released her from custody at that point on a recognizance bond which is unheard of in a murder case.
But the prosecution's medical experts did not believe that Ryan died and then a.
His blood had been tested at two independent laboratories both found at the lean gleich coal in Ryan system and the autopsy revealed calcium oxalate crystals in Ryan's brain consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning.
Tests on Ryan's baby bottle also found trace amounts of ethylene glycol.
Everyone was saying there was a live call in the body.
Cast from different laboratory showed that and everyone agreed that if they're settling Glock all in the body you what name M. Hey the kill the child so the murder case against Patricia Stallings went to trial.
Secures were seeking the death penalty.
Despite the genetic illness diagnosed in DJ the Christian Stallings defense attorney could not produce one medical expert to testify that it was an anime and not anti freeze poisoning the cost Ryan's dad.
I put on my witnesses all of them said F. one block on all of them said it had to be ingested.
The jury also heard what Patricia Stallings said to the social worker when informed of Ryan's death.
But Tricia Stallings was found guilty of murder in the first degree and was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
Her husband David collapsed in shock after hearing the verdict and was rushed to the hospital.
She was just.
Devastated she was very upset she was crying.
We talked for a little while there was a whole lot of comfort I could offer at that point.
Although the jury had reached its verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.
Two local scientists had doubts of their own.
Although Patricia Stallings was found guilty of the poisoning death of her son Ryan with anti freeze not everyone was convinced Dr William sly and Dr James shoemaker wondered whether the lab tests done by their colleagues on by the SmithKline Beecham lab were accurate it was only when I found out that no one had really thoroughly explored the science behind the ethylene glycol testing.
That I became convinced that I had to do it myself.
First Dr shoemaker turned his attention to the gas chromatography used to test Ryan's blood in gas chromatography the sample is vaporized and sent down the queue within inert gas each compound settles in the queue at a different rate which is called the retention time.
Those retention times are then charted on a graph a reference library of retention times then consulted in order to identify any compounds found in the blood.
Medical experts who testified against Patricia Stallings said that the peak on the graph of Ryan's blood serum appeared at a retention time that match that of ethylene glycol.
Dr shoemaker retested Ryan's blood samples and analyze the retention times.
He didn't find ethylene glycol.
He found something else there was a compound that was very highly elevated in the serum compound called propionic acid.
Comes off very close but not identically with ethylene glycol and Haiti and I speculated that that might be the.
The basis of a misidentification that.
Led to the incorrect diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning.
Propionic acid is often produced in patients who have an MFA the rare genetic illness diagnosed in Ryan's brother DJ.
The only difference between propionic acid and ethylene glycol is a few carbon atoms.
To find out if other labs were capable of misreading propionic acid as ethylene glycol Dr shoemaker sent blood samples spiked with propionic acid to seven different laboratories.
Sure enough three out of the seven laboratories that we tested came back with a positive results from my call when we knew the only thing on the samples this propionic acid when Dr shoemaker examines the graph shown to the jury during Patricia Stallings file one showing the ethylene glycol found in Ryan's blood and next to it a draft of the known sample of ethylene glycol he discovered.
Huge mistake but the tragic thing is that no one bothered to actually superimpose the two.
And when you look at it very closely and line up the injection point here and the internal standard here the two picks are actually quite different and.
It will come up here so you can see.
They don't come out at the same time at all the retention times are actually very different.
Dr shoemaker suspected that Ryan Stallings died of and and and had not been poisoned with ethylene glycol.
But Dr shoemaker was a junior member of the faculty at the time and knew that his conclusions would be challenged by experts.
When prosecutors learned about king's new test results they were stopped.
Was it possible that the Tricia Stallings had been convicted of a murder that never happened.
The store hired attorney Robert returned to handle their repeat he immediately requested a new trial arguing that Patricia Stallings first lawyer had not mounted a proper scientific defense after several hours of discussion I came away convinced that Patty did not poison or child and then a horrible injustice had resulted here.
When prosecutors heard the new test results from Saint Louis University even they agreed that this new medical information raised serious questions once we were well aware that they were actually doctors out there prepared to say that that obviously didn't testify trial may have made a difference at the trial and we agreed to a new trial and we'd have to do that but prosecutors had to independent laboratories that found that the lean glycol in Ryan's blood traces of ethylene glycol were found in the baby bottle and the autopsy report found oxalate crystals in Ryan's brain a finding consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning.
To sort through the scientific inconsistencies prosecutors sought an outside expert.
At Yale University they found Dr Pierre Renault one of the world's leading experts in metabolic diseases he reviewed the scientific data that formed the basis for the case against Patricia storms I received all the raw material all the data.
That was really the exceptional moments for me in this story because I couldn't believe how low was a quality of analytical work down in the commercial lab.
Dr Renaldo called the lab reports garbage he agreed with Dr shoemaker and slide that the gas chromatography peak shown to the jury as that of ethylene glycol was not ethylene glycol all and did not match the graph depicting the known sample of ethylene glycol the retention time of the Peking question was thirty three seconds later which invesco Watauga fee is an enormous difference.
This is really huge and one doctor in all the review the mass spectrometry results he found a similar error the spike in Ryan's blood identified as ethylene glycol did not match the known sample.
That really blew me away.
Especially in a case logs me with legal implications he must be perfect match this was not even close it was about again.
Absolutely strikingly obvious evidence that there was no match.
Doctoring although immediately presented his findings to prosecutor George McElroy.
The next day McElroy held a news conference.
State of Missouri's dismissing all pending charges against Patricia Stallings based upon the death of her child run and I'm satisfied I'm convinced.
Doctoring old believes that Ryan Spalding's died and and.
The same genetic illnesses brother DJ was born.
He also believes that the inaccurate lab reports led doctors to administer the wrong treatment the external threat which possibly contributed to Ryan's dad.
The external threat was also the suspected cause of the calcium oxalate crystals found during Ryan's autopsy and not ethylene glycol.
Scientists also suspect that the process of washing Ryan's baby bottle because the false readings of ethylene glycol when the bottle was tested.
The conviction of Patricia Stallings had been a mistake.
All while DJ had been born Palestine's would be in jail for the rest of her life without parole and no one would ever right have raised a second question.
Is what saved her because it the first child's diagnosis would never have been made I can understand.
A person who's been through all that she went through.
Finding the an apology pretty lacking.
Yes I told her I'd.
I had a job to do I had the evidence before me that I fail gave me no choice.
The Tricia Stallings filed lawsuits against the hospitals doctors and laboratories that had misdiagnosed Ryan.
All were settled before going to trial.
Their son DJ who by being born with MMA led scientists to the real killer of his brother Ryan is managing his disease with a special diet and other treatments it is strange that such a small mistake on paper could make such a huge change in the lives of people but in this case you can see that a few millimeters of difference and where a peak appeared on a sheet of paper made all the difference in a woman's life the science.
Was the strongest evidence and was what ultimately convicted but it was also what ultimately Frieder.
