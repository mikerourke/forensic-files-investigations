Vicki Lynne Hoskinson never returned home after running the errands for her mother.
abandoned bicycles was the only clues to her disappearance.
Eight year old Vicky Lynn Hoskinson grew up in flowing wells a suburb in Tucson Arizona she was the youngest in the family brought together by the second marriage of her mother Debbie Carlson.
There was something about her that grab your heart.
The minute you around.
She had this intensity of a royal blue nis in her eyes.
When you look into her eyes.
He saw this depth of wisdom it was beyond her years.
The keys prized possession was the paint sting ray bicycle she had received as a Christmas present which is what she wrote to the mailbox on the day she disappeared.
To get to the mailbox Vicky headed down the dirt path behind some neighbors homes.
Went down a dead end street.
Her mother expected Vicky back in ten minutes when she didn't return she said her older daughter Stephanie to look for her Stephanie came right back in Chester Colossus crimes because mom's side found Becky spike in the middle of the road.
And to the something's wrong something's wrong my mom got in the car and drive around and.
Picked up the bicycle and rode through the neighborhood looking for baking and she returned home she called the police at the time we thought we were possibly looking for just a missing child who had failed to come home after going out to do an errand for her mother and has the search went on it became obvious that something something other than a normal disappearing disappearing childhood occurred.
Hundreds of volunteers searched the nearby desert.
And police helicopters scoured the area.
Vickie'S family pleaded for her safe return on local television my faith in god.
That he's watching over her and he's protecting her in that he is going to bring her home to us.
Police received a number of calls from people who claim to have seen a child who looked like Vicky there were a lot of fifty sightings it's not an unusual phenomenon when you ask people to go look for for such a person in our community was actively looking for Vicky.
Within days of Vicky Lynn Hoskinson disappearance yellow ribbons appeared all over Tucson as a sign of the community's concern for the missing eight year old girl the picture of Vicky that is blocked in everyone's mind of this little gap to this eight year old girl the way Vicky was forever frozen in most people's memory was everywhere it was on the front page of newspapers many times it was on billboards around town it was on TV so often it was one incident and one person who really brought to sign together.
But police had no solid leads on the keys where abouts.
The local police called in the FBI who wanted to question the last teacher at school who had seen the little girl alive it was Vicky's athletic coach Sam hall and the story he told them was chilling.
He said he was in the school playground picking up some sports equipment with the student I'm already ready.
A strange looking character in a sports car caught his eye the man appeared to be staring at the children he had long hair and unkempt appearance and drove away shortly after he was spotted.
Something was telling me that this gentleman just wasn't right and as a Christian man and as a man of prayer and a man who does pray and I have a relationship with the lord I sensed the lord tell me this man was gonna do something evil and wicked denied that I needed to write down everything I saw.
Paul immediately went to his car broke the man's license plate number on a piece of paper and put it in his glove compartment.
The FBI told called the Dickey disappeared near the mailbox one block away not long after hall saw the man in the sports car.
As soon as they told me what happened that Vicky Lynn was abducted immediately I went right back to that car what was this sit in my glove box in my pick up.
The car had a California license plate with the number one K. easy six oh eight.
The car was registered to Frank Jarvis Atwood he had two prior arrests one for lewd and lascivious behavior the other for kidnapping in each case the victims were young boys at what was out on parole at the time of the chaos consumes disappearance.
But there was no proof of any connection between Atwood and Vicki Lynne Hoskinson investigators went back to where they found the bicycle this time they saw something they hadn't seen before.
But I noticed a post been bent over about twenty five feet away at the side of the road so when I went over and examined it it had been a fresh band and the band was about twelve inches from the ground.
Investigators suspected that the dance may have been caused by the perpetrator since it was low to the ground it looked like it was caused by a small vehicle possibly a sports.
The car registered to Frank Atwood was a sports car a Datsun two sixty C..
He said should an all points bulletin for Frank apple.
Three days after Vicky's disappearance Atwood was traced from California to Arizona to Oklahoma and finally to the small town of Kerrville Texas under questioning Atwood said nothing that could link him or his automobile to Vicky's disappearance.
Afterwards one of the detectives noticed a small speck of paint on the front bumper that would scar that looks to be the same color as Vicky's abandoned bicycles Frank Edward was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping.
We all gathered in the living room and they showed the rest on TV and my first feeling was his own my god this man looks like Charles Manson and all I could think about was this man could have touched my daughter.
Atwood maintained his innocence but the police were convinced that car had been at the scene of the crime.
All the proof they need they turned to science.
Frank Edward was in custody on suspicion of kidnapping Vicki Lynne Hoskinson but he denied he was involved in any way.
The family gradually came to terms with the possibility that Vicky would never be found alive.
I thought for sure she was coming home.
That'S when I realized there are coming out.
The only evidence against Atwood was circumstantial a tiny speck of paint on his bumper that may have come from Vicki's bicycle but could have come from anywhere.
Police sent afterwards car and bicycle accident reconstruction is Paul Larmer when Larmour replaced the bicycle on the ground sideways he noticed that the petals at the exact same height as the scratch marks and the indentation on the gravel pan under Atwood's front bumper.
There was no impact in the classic sense of the word there was contact between the two and the car continued to push against the bike pushed it down on the ground and overrode it to the point that the pedal deform the gravel pan under the car Barmore believes that at which car was going less than five miles an hour when it struck Vicki's bicycle this would account for the lack of blood at the scene the car was going too slow for Vicky to have sustained serious injuries next the bumper of that which car in Vicki's bicycle were both sent to the FBI lab in Washington DC.
Prosecution requested that we look at the bicycle.
And compare that to the paint that was scraped off the bumper of the vehicle as well as a paint that was remaining on the vehicle and try to make a comparison to see if those pains originate from the same source namely did the paint paint.
On the suspect's bumper.
Match the paint paint from the victim's bicycle.
Paint analysis involves microscopic in micro capital examination.
Under the microscope the samples of paint from Atwood's bumper in the bicycle appeared to be similar next micro chemicals were added to both paint samples both reacted to the chemicals in the same way.
Finally the paint samples were placed in the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and heated to a temperature of seven hundred sixty degrees centigrade which vaporizes and separates the organic components of the paint samples.
The compounds in both paint samples were identical.
This did not necessarily prove that the paint on Atwood's bumper came from Vicki Hoskins and bicycle.
When Jim court the study the paint samples on to the scanning electron microscope he noticed one element in the paint from the keys bicycle which was not common in the chemical formulation of paint he found traces of nickel but where had it come from when he looked closer at Atwood's bumper he noticed that the chrome on the bumper next to the paint paint had been scratched exposing the nickel under plating.
The chemical composition of the nickel under plating on Atwood's bumper was identical to the nickel sample found on Vicki's bicycle.
It leads one to believe as a forensic scientists that these two items namely the bicycle and the bumper were in forcible contact with each other at one time means that they made physical contact with each other.
This two way transfer paint from the bicycle on to the bumper and the nickel from the bumper on to the bicycle placed Frank at which point the mobile at the scene of the key Hoskins ins disappearance.
Seven months after Vicky Hoskins ins disappearance a man hiking through the desert outside of Tucson found a human skull.
Which looked like that of a child it was an area that we had initially speculated.
if you were going to get rid of a body where would you do it and it was an area that was close to.
The area where she disappeared it's on that side of town that was remote.
After several days of searching more bones were discovered.
Some have been known by animals among those found was a lower jaw bone with teeth.
The news was devastating to the family although not a surprise.
Him and I are really close.
I just knew.
Looking at him what the answer was without them telling me verbally.
And watching all these grown men turned their back to me because they didn't want me to see that they were crying and.
Branch against Republicans Dr Walter Burke was asked to analyze the skeletal remains to see if they belonged to Vickie Hoskinson.
He used a technique called comparative dental radiography to compare the teeth and jawbone found in the desert to the dental X. rays of Vicki Hoskinson they were a match but he could not determine the cause of death from the rest of the remains were a sharp implement marks and really nothing that would indicate a blunt force trauma and like that but so cause of death could have been practically anything hundreds of people attended the key Hoskinson funeral many knew of her only through news reports but wanted to share in the family's grief.
They'Ve granted the emotion well if people here but of all people in Tucson it was something that everyone at the time was talking about and I can't think of anything that's been that this even approach that magnitude sense.
Frank Atwood was charged with murder.
His lawyers pointed out that that would have been in police custody since three days after Vicky's disappearance they said it was impossible to know when the body had been dumped in the desert it was possible it could have happened while at what was in custody.
Medical examiner Dr Richard Brady was asked if there was any way to tell when Vicky Lynn Hoskinson had been killed now we mistake it for anything we can find on the bones.
And one of the things we found on the bones I was there was some atmosphere there edible seer also known as mortuary fact is a great waxy substance which forms when a body is exposed to high temperatures bacteria and water.
Dr Frady knew that the desert had high temperatures as well as sources of bacteria but desert's have little or no water was it possible that the body was first in an area with water before it was moved to the desert if so Frank Edward would be exonerated since he had been in custody since three days after the girl's disappearance Dr Freddie research the weather conditions for the period that Vicky Hoskinson had been missing we found that within a day or two after she had disappeared that there were heavy rains in that area and then there were no more rains for months.
See your doctor Brady that the body was in the desert during these rain storms most likely in a shallow grave.
The rain water.
And the high temperatures over the next two to three months forming the adipose seer found on her bones we now know that the body had been there during these heavy rains had it been a month later two months three months it would have been dry and the body would have been mummified and you would not have seen the end of this year.
This put the time of the death within a day or two of her disappearance.
Prosecutors believe that Atwood was cruising the Tucson area for a child to day Sam hall saw him near the school yard fortunately hall had the presence of mind to write his license number down on a piece of paper.
A half hour later at would solve the key on her pink bicycle a block away from the school xcelerated into Vicki's bicycle walking her to the ground.
The bumper if the bicycle just under the sea which produced the double transfer of paint onto his bumper and Nicole from the bumper on to the bicycles.
Leaving an indentation and scratch marks.
Thank you to his car possibly with the promise that he would drive.
No one knows what happened to Vicki Lynne Hoskinson during that fateful drive to the desk.
But prosecutors believe he buried her body later that same day in a shallow grave.
Within a day or two.
Causing the other procedure to form on her decomposing bones the key was in the wrong spot at the wrong time I believe that Frank kidnapped I believe the hitter knocked her off the bicycle to make contact with her and I I think he'd even done that in the past made contact with people by contacting them on bicycles I believe he sexually assaulted her and I believe he killed her.
Frank Jarvis Atwood was tried and convicted of first degree murder in the death of Vicki Lynne Hoskinson and was sentenced to death from an investigative standpoint the real hero in this investigation was Sam hall who's a gym teacher here at Homer Davis elementary school people say that I'm the hero of the case.
But I just.
Want to be a hero that would have saved a child's life that's all.
I'M not a victim that will ever forgive.
The perpetrator the murder I will never forget him.
And I don't visit the cemetery because I don't believe that that's where she is when out with a left turn in the desert that's where she was laid to rest I feel that that really is for other than in my heart where my sister is.
There was one time when I was going through a really tough time.
Trying to come to a peace about her death.
That she came to my bedroom.
And I woke I'm in this fight I'm sleeping and I hear these will pit a patter of feet and this little tapping up mama mama mama and I look up if you stand this is after he's been deceased.
And there's this white light surrounding her.
I need you to be okay.
It was a turning point for me.
